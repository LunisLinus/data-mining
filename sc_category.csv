AI for Closed-Loop Control Systems: New Opportunities for Modeling, Designing, and Tuning Control Systems;;;['Julius Schöning', 'Adrian Riechmann', 'Hans-Jürgen Pfisterer'];;;February 2022;;;ICMLC '22: Proceedings of the 2022 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing;;;Control Systems, particularly closed-loop control systems (CLCS), are frequently used in production machines, vehicles, and robots nowadays. CLCS are needed to actively align actual values of a process to a given reference or set values in real-time with a very high precession. Yet, artificial intelligence (AI) is not used to model, design, optimize, and tune CLCS. This paper will highlight potential AI-empowered and -based control system designs and designing procedures, gathering new opportunities and research direction in the field of control system engineering. Therefore, this paper illustrates which building blocks within the standard block diagram of CLCS can be replaced by AI, i.e., artificial neuronal networks (ANN). Having processes with real-time contains and functional safety in mind, it is discussed if AI-based controller blocks can cope with these demands. By concluding the paper, the pros and cons of AI-empowered as well as -based CLCS designs are discussed, and possible research directions for introducing AI in the domain of control system engineering are given.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3529836.3529952;;;Systems AND Control
A semantic-based access control approach for systems of systems;;;['Mersedeh Sadeghi', 'Luca Sartor', 'Matteo Rossi'];;;December 2021;;;ACM SIGAPP Applied Computing Review;;;Access control management in a System of Systems---i.e., a collaborative environment composed of a multitude of distributed autonomous organizations---is a challenging task. To answer the challenge, in this paper we propose a novel approach that incorporates semantic technologies in the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) approach. Building on the basic principles of ABAC, our approach allows for a highly expressive modeling of the context in which access decisions are made, by providing mechanisms to describe rich relationships among entities, which can evolve over time. In addition, our system works in a truly decentralized manner, which makes it suitable for geographically distributed enterprise systems. We show the feasibility in practice of our approach through some experimental results.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512753.3512754;;;Systems AND Control

The system consists of a main controller STM32, an angle sensor, a camera, two steering gears and various connections. The three variables of ball position, velocity and angle of the plate are used as feedback parameters, and the multivariable fusion control of the system is greatly optimized by the system hardware to realize the accurate control of the ball movement position and trajectory on the plate, which can resist certain external interference and adjust the feedback quickly and with slight error.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3501409.3501419;;;Systems AND Control

Formation control and coordination of swarm robotic systems;;;['Abzal Ermekbayuly Kyzyrkanov', 'Sabyrzhan Kubeisinovich Atanov', 'Shadi Abdel Rahman Aljawarneh'];;;October 2021;;;ICEMIS'21: The 7th International Conference on Engineering &amp; MIS 2021;;;In many applications, a group of autonomous mobile robots must follow a given trajectory while maintaining a certain geometric structure. If the motion in formation is properly organized, many advantages over traditional systems can be obtained: system cost can be reduced, system reliability and efficiency can be increased, while ensuring the reconfigurability and flexibility of the system's structure. Movement while maintaining a certain geometric structure has a wide range of applications. For example, in military missions, autonomous vehicles must maintain a certain structure of formation to cover terrain and conduct reconnaissance; in Smart Highway systems, the capacity of the transportation network can be greatly increased if vehicles can be grouped together at the same speed while maintaining a certain distance between them. This paper provides an algorithm for movement with a certain geometric structure of a group of autonomous mobile robots.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492547.3492704;;;Systems AND Control

Formal verification of hyperproperties for control systems;;;['Mahathi Anand', 'Vishnu Murali', 'Ashutosh Trivedi', 'Majid Zamani'];;;May 2021;;;CAADCPS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Computation-Aware Algorithmic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest and research in verifying complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) against rich and expressive specifications [2] such as safety and liveness, to provide formal guarantees for safety-critical systems. While linear temporal logic (LTL) [1] can capture these properties of interest, it is incapable of specifying many information-flow properties that rely on information of multiple traces. These properties, which are described over sets of traces, are called hyperproperties [4] and their corresponding temporal logics have been well studied. The extension of LTL to capture a fragment of hyperproperties, namely, HyperLTL [3], makes use of trace variables to specify individual execution traces and allows for quantification of trace variables to precede a (trace) quantifier-free formula. Here, we present a sound approach for verifying discrete-time control systems against HyperLTL formulae through the use of so-called augmented barrier certificates (ABCs).;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457335.3461715;;;Systems AND Control

Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically. Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445969.3450429;;;Systems AND Control
Vision: Security-Usability Threat Modeling for Industrial Control Systems;;;['Karen Li', 'Awais Rashid', 'Anne Roudaut'];;;October 2021;;;EuroUSEC '21: Proceedings of the 2021 European Symposium on Usable Security;;;Industrial Control System (ICS) that run large-scale systems such as water, power and manufacturing are increasingly in focus given high profile attacks against such infrastructures. These systems are connected to IT systems and the Internet, the intersections of their users – typically control systems engineers and operators – with security requirements and systems add to the complexity of the threats faced by these environments. The challenges of usable security in IT systems have been studied extensively, including work on security-usability threat modeling (i.e. lack of usability exacerbating security issues). However, no work has examined similar challenges within ICS settings where, in addition to the regular requirements of information confidentiality, information integrity and information availability, requirements such as processsafety, processintegrity and processreliability are paramount for the users. Using the case of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), we detail the workflow that the user undertake for a security task. We analyze this workflow using STRIDE, an established threat modeling approach. We then map the threats against an existing security-usability threat model for IT systems whilst also taking into account the specific process-related requirements critical to ICS users. We then derive an initial security-usability threat model for ICS as a first step towards further work in this regard.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3481357.3481527;;;Systems AND Control
Constrained Sliding Mode Control for Uncertain Manipulator Systems with Prescribed Performance;;;['Zhenghang Zhang'];;;May 2021;;;RSAE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 3rd International Conference on Robotics Systems and Automation Engineering;;;Trajectory tracking of robots plays an important role in both theory and engineering applications, but trajectory tracking with predetermined performance is still an open question to be solved. In this paper, the trajectory tracking control problem of a class of manipulator systems is investigated. We design a sliding mode based controller to ensure that the joint position and velocity tracking errors converge into a user-defined range within finite time. We prove rigorously that with the help of exponential-type Lypapunov function, sliding mode would never exceed the preassigned range, leading to constraint convergence performance of the corresponding states. The numerical simulation results shows its validity and rationality.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3475851.3475855;;;Systems AND Control
Design of Ship Engine Speed System Based on RBF Neural Network PID Control;;;['Qing Wang', 'Zongquan Jiang', 'Yuanchang He', 'Lili Zhou', 'Li Geng'];;;October 2021;;;EITCE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Electronic Information Technology and Computer Engineering;;;The speed control of ship sailing on the water surface has become one of the important research contents of ship sailing stability. The traditional PID control model is not suitable for the stable navigation of ships, and there are some shortcomings such as too long adjustment time, too much overshoot and long rise time of the control system. In order to improve the control precision of ship engine speed system, design of Ship Engine Speed System Based on RBF Neural Network PID Control is proposed. The RBF neural network model is used to obtain a certain adaptive ability, and the gradient descent algorithm is used to obtain the optimal control parameters of the ship engine speed, so that the PID control effect reaches the optimal. The experimental simulation results show that compared with the traditional PID control, the RBF neural network PID control system overshoot is very small, the adjustment time and rise time is relatively short, and the control effect is very well.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3501409.3501442;;;Systems AND Control
Prespecified-Time Control of Complex Networks Coupled with Nonlinear Dynamical Systems;;;['Juan Chen', 'Xinru Li', 'Ganbin Shen'];;;October 2021;;;CSAE '21: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Application Engineering;;;The control of complex networks is a hot-spot topic in the field of complex networks. Based on Lyapunov function and matrix theory, a control scheme for complex networks coupled with nonlinear dynamical systems is presented here. Different from the existing finite-time control strategies, the settling time of our proposed scheme does not depend on initial values or the control parameters of the system, and can be given arbitrarily. In addition, the scheme is applicable to both directed and undirected networks, and connectivity is not required. Finally, two simulations are provided to confirm the feasibility of our theoretical result.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487075.3487113;;;Systems AND Control
Symbolic reach-avoid control of multi-agent systems;;;['Rupak Majumdar', 'Kaushik Mallik', 'Mahmoud Salamati', 'Sadegh Soudjani', 'Mehrdad Zareian'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;We consider the decentralized controller synthesis problem for multi-agent systems with global reach-avoid specifications. Each agent is modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system with disturbances. The objective is to synthesize local feedback controllers that guarantee that the overall multi-agent system meets the global specification despite the influence of disturbances. On the one hand, existing techniques based on planning or trajectory optimization usually ignore the effects of disturbances and produce open-loop nominal trajectories that are not generally sufficient in the presence of disturbances. On the other hand, techniques based on formal synthesis, which guarantee satisfaction of temporal specifications, do not scale as the number of agents increases. We address these limitations by proposing a two-level solution approach that combines fast global nominal trajectory generation and local application of formal synthesis. At the top level, we ignore the effect of disturbances and obtain a joint open-loop plan for the system using a fast trajectory optimizer. At the lower level, we use abstraction-based controller design to synthesize a set of decentralized feedback controllers that track the high level plan against worst-case disturbances, thus ensuring satisfaction of the global specification. We provide the implementation of our approach in an open-source tool called GAMARA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GAMARA on several multi-robot examples using two particular classes of control specifications. In the first type, we assume that the robots need to fulfill their own reach-avoid tasks while avoiding collision with each other. In the second type, we require the robots to fulfill reach-avoid tasks while maintaining certain formation constraints. The experiments show that GAMARA produces formally guaranteed feedback controllers while scaling to many robots. In contrast, nominal open-loop controllers do not guarantee the satisfaction of the specification, and global formal approaches run out of memory before synthesizing a controller.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3450548;;;Systems AND Control

Adaptive Tracking Control for Uncertain Cancer-Tumor-Immune Systems;;;['Hongmei Jiao', 'Qikun Shen', 'Yan Shi', 'Peng Shi'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics;;;In this paper, the problem of control is investigated for cancer-tumor-immune systems, based on a two-dimension uncertain nonlinear model describing the interaction between immune and cancer cells in a body. First, the control problem is transformed into a state tracking problem. Second, an adaptive control method is proposed to track and stop the growth of cancer and maintain cancer and immune cells at an acceptable level. Different from the existing results in literature, the singularity problem in controller and the inaccuracy in control design have been overcome. From theoretical analysis, it is shown that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and the tracking errors converge to the origin. Finally, simulation results illustrate not only the competitive relationship between immune system and tumor, but also the immune system has strong immunity to low level tumor volumes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TCBB.2020.3036069;;;Systems AND Control
Poisoning attacks on cyber attack detectors for industrial control systems;;;['Moshe Kravchik', 'Battista Biggio', 'Asaf Shabtai'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;Recently, neural network (NN)-based methods, including autoencoders, have been proposed for the detection of cyber attacks targeting industrial control systems (ICSs). Such detectors are often retrained, using data collected during system operation, to cope with the natural evolution (i.e., concept drift) of the monitored signals. However, by exploiting this mechanism, an attacker can fake the signals provided by corrupted sensors at training time and poison the learning process of the detector such that cyber attacks go undetected at test time. With this research, we are the first to demonstrate such poisoning attacks on ICS cyber attack online NN detectors. We propose two distinct attack algorithms, namely, interpolation- and back-gradient based poisoning, and demonstrate their effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world ICS data. We also discuss and analyze some potential mitigation strategies.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3441892;;;Systems AND Control
Detection of Anomalous Values within TIA Project Data History for Industrial Control Systems;;;['Laura Hartmann', 'Steffen Wendzel'];;;November 2021;;;EICC '21: Proceedings of the 2021 European Interdisciplinary Cybersecurity Conference;;;Attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) have been intensively studied during the last decade. Malicious alternations of ICS can appear in several different ways, e.g. in changed network traffic patterns or in modified data stored on ICS components. While several heuristics and machine learning methods have been proposed to analyze different types of ICS data regarding anomalies, no work is known that uses the data of Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal for anomaly detection. TIA Portal is a popular software system for organizing the ICS, with which configuration and programming data can be viewed, changed and deleted. By saving the single project datasets historically, old versions of the current system configurations can be restored.  In this initial work, we propose heuristics that detect anomalies in the TIA Portal data. In particular do we analyze the historical modifications within TIA Portal data by investigating long-term backups. Our approach covers both, changes to the data caused by infiltrated attacks as well as malicious changes made by employees who have direct access to the machines. We therefore started to examine real TIA Portal project data of an automotive manufacturer’s production line, covering a period of about three years of historical data, for various features that may indicate anomalies.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487405.3487662;;;Systems AND Control
An Intermittent FxLMS Algorithm for Active Noise Control Systems With Saturation Nonlinearity;;;['Xing Tian', 'Jie Huang', 'Xuelei Feng', 'Yong Shen'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing;;;In practical active noise control systems, saturation nonlinearity is one of the most common nonlinear effects, which can occur at the electronic circuits in the secondary path. Adaptive algorithms designed for linear systems, such as the filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm, may diverge in nonlinear systems with a saturated secondary path and result in limited noise reduction performance. Various nonlinear algorithms with improved stability have been proposed; however, a trade-off between noise reduction performance and computational complexity exists when selecting a satisfactory algorithm. This paper therefore proposes a simple algorithm that can achieve significant noise reduction with low computational complexity. The proposed algorithm adopts the same update equation as the FxLMS algorithm, but uses an intermittent update strategy to avoid unnecessary fluctuations of the weight vector when the output of the control filter lies in the saturation region. Simulation results under different conditions demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TASLP.2022.3192725;;;Systems AND Control
Predefined-Time Tracking Control for Second-Order Leader-Following Multi-Agent Systems via Prescribed-Time Observers and Sliding Mode Control Strategy;;;['Zhiwen Chen', 'Yuanhong Ren', 'Yong Ji'];;;October 2021;;;EITCE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Electronic Information Technology and Computer Engineering;;;Predefined-time tracking problem for second-order nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) under undirected graph is investigated in this paper. Firstly, by designing a group of observers, each follower can obtain the position and velocity tracking errors between it and the leader within any specified time. Secondly, an observer-based sliding surface is designed, so that the system trajectories will reach the sliding manifold within another specified time. Finally, by combining the proposed observer and sliding surface, we propose a distributed controller which can guarantee the predefined-time leader-following consensus.

Actor-Critic Neural Network Based Finite-time Control for Uncertain Robotic Systems;;;['Changyi Lei'];;;May 2021;;;ICISDM '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Information System and Data Mining;;;This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) based finite-time control (FTC) of uncertain robotic systems. The proposed methodology consists of a terminal sliding mode based finite-time controller and an Actor-Critic (AC)-based RL loop that adjusts the output of the neural network. The terminal sliding mode controller is designed to ensure calculable settling time, as compared to conventional asymptotic stability. The AC-based RL loop uses recursive least square technique to update the critic network and policy gradient algorithm to estimate the parameters of actor network. We show that the AC is beneficial to improve robustness of terminal sliding mode controller both in approaching stage and near equilibrium. The performance of proposed controller is compared to that with only terminal sliding mode controller. The simulation results show that proposed controller outperforms pure terminal sliding mode controller, and that AC is a successful supplement to FTC.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3471287.3471288;;;Systems AND Control

In addition, most researches still rely on time-consuming modular exponential calculations, elliptic-curve based signatures and encryption algorithms. However, few studies can fully consider the development of lightweight access control mechanisms for health care information database systems. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) devices are based on unique physical changes that occur naturally in the semiconductor manufacturing process, resulting in unique identification and unpredictability. They are used in authentication and encryption mechanisms and have significant improvements in performance. This investigation discusses and analyses on the privacy protection, authorization and access control characteristics of the health care information database, and develops a secure and efficient access control scheme by using PUF technology for health information systems.

Requirements and Challenges for Digital Forensic Readiness in Industrial Automation and Control Systems;;;['Richard Thron', 'Herbert Dirnberger', 'Simon Tjoa', 'Gerald Quirchmayr'];;;January 2022;;;IEIM 2022: 2022 The 3rd International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Industrial Management;;;Industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are vital components in various industries. Incidents in the past, highlighted the magnitude of impacts arising from attacks, such as disruptions of power supply or in manufacturing plants. In order to adequately react on incidents and analyze deliberate attacks on IACS, it is indispensable to have appropriate forensics capabilities in this area. Based on an analysis of existing approaches and recent research results, this paper provides an overview of significant challenges that need to be overcome as prerequisites for building effective and efficient forensic capabilities for IACS. The classification and typology of Digital Forensic Readiness (DFR) in IACS requirements presented in this paper, pave the way to better integrate forensic capabilities into future IACS systems. As smart manufacturing is now a focus of designing and implementing the next generation of IACS systems, a unique opportunity arises for introducing forensic capabilities at the system design level without having to re-engineer whole infrastructures. At the same time the much higher dependence on IT infrastructures and the resulting temptation for criminals are creating an environment in which such forensic capabilities become indispensable. This paper can therefore be considered as an initial step, laying the foundations for the development of a generic forensic analysis model in smart manufacturing environments.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524338.3524374;;;Systems AND Control
A Robust Control Scheme for Time Delay Switch Attacks;;;['Luka Malashkhia', 'Laura P.

Given that sensors are widely dependent upon to control manufacturing processes, the sensor-controller loop becomes an easy target for attacks. In this paper, a novel robust control framework is developed for systems subject to time delay switch (TDS) attacks, where data transmission from sensors to controllers are maliciously delayed. The attackers intend to make controllers use noncurrent information about the system states in order to destabilize and sabotage the system. Particularly, to increase the effectiveness of delay detection and prediction as well as error bound estimation for control, a new state space model based on diffeomorphism is formulated. A Markov chain model is developed to represent the TDS attacks. The uncertainty of system states is quantified and the upper bounds of delays are estimated. With the estimated bounds, a sliding integral mode control is developed to adjust the system to converge to the sliding manifold. The new framework is demonstrated with a 3D printer thermal control example.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462223.3485621;;;Systems AND Control

A Comparative Analysis Between Information Flow Control Tools for Java-written systems;;;['Gabrielle Porto', 'Rodrigo Andrade', 'Felipe Ebert'];;;September 2021;;;SBCARS '21: Proceedings of the 15th Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse;;;Information Flow Control (IFC) tools are a common way to analyze source code with the goal to find confidentiality or integrity violations for sensitive information. Therefore, to correctly protect such information (e.g., passwords), it is important to choose the most suitable tool for each target software system. In this context, we evaluate precision, recall, and accuracy for three open-source IFC tools for Java-written systems. We also check whether these tools are useful to protect sensitive information of real systems. First, we execute these tools against test cases of the SecuriBench Micro benchmark built for this purpose. Then, we run three selected IFC tools (JOANA, PIDGIN, and Flowdroid) to assess whether they are able to detect violations for rules we define considering each real system. Our results show that JOANA and PIDGIN overcome FlowDroid regarding precision, recall, and accuracy. Furthermore, the execution of JOANA and PIDGIN allow us to find eight confidentiality and integrity violations for the target systems. We registered these violations as issues on those projects. Our results also demonstrate that JOANA is faster than PIDGIN. At last, we provide some discussion for developers on which IFC tool fits better when dealing with sensitive information in software systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3483899.3483901;;;Systems AND Control

On the Joint Control of Multiple Building Systems with Reinforcement Learning;;;['Tianyu Zhang', 'Gaby Baasch', 'Omid Ardakanian', 'Ralph Evins'];;;June 2021;;;e-Energy '21: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems;;;Commercial buildings are comprised of multiple mechanical and electrical systems that work in tandem to provide a healthy, safe, and comfortable environment for occupants. These systems have complex interactions with each other, and consume a large amount of energy. In this paper, we apply three model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms to jointly control HVAC and blind systems in a multi-zone test building, in scenarios with and without automatic dimming of the lights in response to daylight levels. The control agents are trained through interactions with a building simulator that generates traces for the movement of occupants. We investigate the three-way trade-off between energy use, thermal comfort, and visual comfort, and discuss how the joint control of the building systems could provide a better trade-off compared to when they are controlled separately. We compare the performance of the proposed control algorithms assuming the availability of occupancy data with two spatial resolutions, and confirm through experiments that a better trade-off can be achieved should zone-level occupancy information become available. Incorporating zone-level occupancy information, we show that 11.0% and 31.8% more energy can be saved respectively in heating and cooling seasons over existing rule-based baselines that control the same building systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447555.3464855;;;Systems AND Control
A software architecture to control service-oriented manufacturing systems;;;['Sebastiano Gaiardelli', 'Stefano Spellini', 'Marco Panato', 'Michele Lora', 'Franco Fummi'];;;March 2022;;;DATE '22: Proceedings of the 2022 Conference &amp; Exhibition on Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe;;;This paper presents a software architecture extending the classical automation pyramid to control and reconfigure flexible, service-oriented manufacturing systems. At the Planning level, the architecture requires a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) consistent with the International Society of Automation (ISA) standard. Then, the Supervisory level is automated by introducing a novel component, called Automation Manager. The new component interacts upward with the MES, and downward with a set of servers providing access to the manufacturing machines.

Extracting Concise Bug-Fixing Patches from Human-Written Patches in Version Control Systems;;;['Yanjie Jiang', 'Hui Liu', 'Nan Niu', 'Lu Zhang', 'Yamin Hu'];;;May 2021;;;ICSE '21: Proceedings of the 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering;;;High-quality and large-scale repositories of real bugs and their concise patches collected from real-world applications are critical for research in the software engineering community. In such a repository, each real bug is explicitly associated with its fix. Therefore, on one side, the real bugs and their fixes may inspire novel approaches for finding, locating, and repairing software bugs; on the other side, the real bugs and their fixes are indispensable for rigorous and meaningful evaluation of approaches for software testing, fault localization, and program repair. To this end, a number of such repositories, e.g., Defects4J, have been proposed. However, such repositories are rather small because their construction involves expensive human intervention. Although bug-fixing code commits as well as associated test cases could be retrieved from version control systems automatically, existing approaches could not yet automatically extract concise bug-fixing patches from bug-fixing commits because such commits often involve bug-irrelevant changes. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach, called BugBuilder, to extracting complete and concise bug-fixing patches from human-written patches in version control systems. It excludes refactorings by detecting refactorings involved in bug-fixing commits, and reapplying detected refactorings on the faulty version. It enumerates all subsets of the remaining part and validates them on test cases. If none of the subsets has the potential to be a complete bug-fixing patch, the remaining part as a whole is taken as a complete and concise bug-fixing patch. Evaluation results on 809 real bug-fixing commits in Defects4J suggest that BugBuilder successfully generated complete and concise bug-fixing patches for forty percent of the bug-fixing commits, and its precision (99%) was even higher than human experts.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00069;;;Systems AND Control
The Wireless Control Bus: Enabling Efficient Multi-Hop Event-Triggered Control with Concurrent Transmissions;;;['Matteo Trobinger', 'Gabriel de Albuquerque Gleizer', 'Timofei Istomin', 'Manuel Mazo', 'Amy L. Murphy', 'Gian Pietro Picco'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Event-triggered control (ETC) holds the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of wireless networked control systems. Unfortunately, its real-world impact has hitherto been hampered by the lack of a network stack able to transfer its benefits from theory to practice specifically by supporting the latency and reliability requirements of the aperiodic communication ETC induces. This is precisely the contribution of this article.Our Wireless Control Bus (WCB) exploits carefully orchestrated network-wide floods of concurrent transmissions to minimize overhead during quiescent, steady-state periods, and ensures timely and reliable collection of sensor readings and dissemination of actuation commands when an ETC triggering condition is violated. Using a cyber-physical testbed emulating a water distribution system controlled over a real-world multi-hop wireless network, we show that ETC over WCB achieves the same quality of periodic control at a fraction of the energy costs, therefore unleashing and concretely demonstrating its full potential for the first time.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485467;;;Systems AND Control
Device-Type Profiling for Network Access Control Systems using Clustering-Based Multivariate Gaussian Outlier Score;;;['Musa Muhammad', 'Uchenna Daniel Ani', 'Aminu Aliyu Abdullahi', 'Petar Radanliev'];;;December 2021;;;ICFNDS 2021: The 5th International Conference on Future Networks &amp; Distributed Systems;;;Behaviour profiling is used in organisations to identify the working patterns of agents: humans or devices. It can be used to detect abnormal patterns of devices in an organisation’s BYOD network to help control network access. Although BYOD offers great benefits of improving productivity and job satisfaction while reducing cost, it bears some security issues around access control with limitations in addressing insider threat scenarios. This means that motivated and determined attackers with valid access credentials can exploit the weaknesses to compromise the system. The limitation of mobile devices can mean that traditional network access control mechanism are ineffective in addressing insider threats, and can impact on device capacity and functionality. Thus, it is crucial to explore other ways of identifying insider threats from anomalous device behaviours. We propose a device-type profiling for threat detection which uses packet inter-arrival time patterns of devices for automatic identification of abnormal device-types. Experimental tests using clustering-based multivariate gaussian outlier score (CMGOS) to clearly distinguish and label normal and abnormal inter-arrival time patterns yielded promising results. This affirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach to support system administrators in monitoring and detecting insider threats for timely and effective access control response.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508072.3508113;;;Systems AND Control
Efficient Industrial Control Systems risk assessment using the attack path to the critical device;;;['Mariko Fujimoto', 'Wataru Matsuda', 'Takuho Mitsunaga', 'Yoshihiro Hashimoto'];;;April 2021;;;MSIE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 3rd International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering;;;In cyberattacks against Industrial Control Systems (ICS), one of the final goals of attackers is to impair ICS operations. Recent ICS tend to be connected with other networks and are often implemented with common technologies in order to increase production efficiency and reduce costs. This leads to the creation of new attack surfaces that increase the cyber risks of these systems. Although preventing system intrusion without fault could be difficult, if attacks can be prevented at an early stage before they reach the physical world, damage can be minimized. Thus, appropriate cybersecurity risk assessment methods for ICS are necessary. ICS risk assessment methods proposed in previous research require more time to administer, and they heavily depend on the analysts’ particular expertise and skill to efficiently examine attack scenarios and attack paths. In this research, we propose an efficient quantitative risk assessment method to evaluate the risk of possible attacks on critical ICS devices. This method uses packet capture data in the ICS network to automatically enumerate possible attack paths and calculates the risk level of each attack path. It then comprehensively evaluates the risk level of an entire ICS by utilizing multiple metrics such as the severity of vulnerabilities that exist in specific devices or communication methods, security measures that have been taken, and the features of the attack paths to the critical devices.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460824.3460859;;;Systems AND Control

In order to fully utilize spectrum resource and improve the fairness of allocation, a novel resource allocation scheme is investigated in OFDM Systems for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in this paper, where cognitive small cell base stations (SBSs) are capable of communicating with multiple secondary users (SUs) via the multiple OFDM subcarriers of primary users (PUs). First, we establish the adaptive resource allocation model, and then, a joint problem of spectrum allocation and power control is formulated with the aim of maximizing the total throughput of SUs while taking the fairness issue into consideration.

Design of phase control and drive system for phase-controlled transducer based on high intensity focused ultrasound;;;['Xinyu Guo', 'Jinxu Tao', 'Jiaqi Wang'];;;August 2021;;;CCRIS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 2nd International Conference on Control, Robotics and Intelligent System;;;In recent years, the multi-element phase-controlled transducer used in high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment have attracted the attention of many researchers due to their advantages such as adjustable focal length. The phase control and drive system of the multi-element phase-controlled transducer is one of the key factors that determine whether it can be used in clinical treatment. In this paper, a field programmable logic gate array (FPGA), a high-speed digital-to-analog converter and an integrated power amplifier are used to design a phase control and drive system for multi-element phase-controlled transducer for high intensity focused ultrasound treatment. The system has functions of multi-channel output and real-time transmission of delay data of each channel by the personal computer. The actual measurement results show that the peak-to-peak value of the output sine wave signal of each channel of the system can reach 35.3V, the phase resolution can reach 1ns, the delay error is less than 1ns, and the output signal has no high-order harmonic interference, which meets the phase resolution and driving requirements of multi-element phase-controlled transducer applied in clinical treatment.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3483845.3483859;;;Systems AND Control
Research on Operating System Kernel Security Based on Mandatory Behavior Control Mechanism (MBC);;;['Zhang Jinbo', 'Shen Wuqiang', 'Shen Guiquan'];;;June 2021;;;ICCIR '21: Proceedings of the 2021 1st International Conference on Control and Intelligent Robotics;;;The current operating system security is mainly achieved by controlling the access to the operating system, which cannot effectively ensure the kernel security and leads to a large amount of data redundancy in the system kernel due to the need to review and other judgments on all access operations in turn. To address these problems, we study the kernel security of operating systems based on the mandatory behavior control mechanism (MBC). Partition management of the kernel is achieved by partitioning the system kernel for isolation and setting inter-partition communication. The kernel functions are divided into three parts: security detection, storage management, and read management, to facilitate modular kernel management. After building the framework of the control The comparative experimental data show that the OS kernel data redundancy ratio is less than 13% and has good security when applying this OS security scheme.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473714.3473727;;;Systems AND Control
Dynamic Regret Minimization for Control of Non-stationary Linear Dynamical Systems;;;['Yuwei Luo', 'Varun Gupta', 'Mladen Kolar'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems;;;We consider the problem of controlling a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) system over a finite horizon T with fixed and known cost matrices Q,R, but unknown and non-stationary dynamics A_t, B_t. The sequence of dynamics matrices can be arbitrary, but with a total variation, V_T, assumed to be o(T) and unknown to the controller. Under the assumption that a sequence of stabilizing, but potentially sub-optimal controllers is available for all t, we present an algorithm that achieves the optimal dynamic regret of O(V_T^2/5 T^3/5 ). With piecewise constant dynamics, our algorithm achieves the optimal regret of O(sqrtST ) where S is the number of switches. The crux of our algorithm is an adaptive non-stationarity detection strategy, which builds on an approach recently developed for contextual Multi-armed Bandit problems. We also argue that non-adaptive forgetting (e.g., restarting or using sliding window learning with a static window size) may not be regret optimal for the LQR problem, even when the window size is optimally tuned with the knowledge of $V_T$. The main technical challenge in the analysis of our algorithm is to prove that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator has a small bias when the parameter to be estimated is non-stationary. Our analysis also highlights that the key motif driving the regret is that the LQR problem is in spirit a bandit problem with linear feedback and locally quadratic cost. This motif is more universal than the LQR problem itself, and therefore we believe our results should find wider application.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508029;;;Systems AND Control

The dynamic of agents is a linear model with high order. By constructing the measurement state vector, measurement error vector, and utilizing linear matrix inequations as well as Lyapunov stability theory, the control inputs proposed is verified to lead the multi-agent system to group consensus.

Switching controller synthesis for delay hybrid systems under perturbations;;;['Yunjun Bai', 'Ting Gan', 'Li Jiao', 'Bican Xia', 'Bai Xue', 'Naijun Zhan'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;Delays are ubiquitous in modern hybrid systems, which exhibit both continuous and discrete dynamical behaviors. Induced by signal transmission, conversion, the nature of plants, and so on, delays may appear either in the continuous evolution of a hybrid system such that the evolution depends not only on the present state but also on its execution history, or in the discrete switching between its different control modes. In this paper we come up with a new model of hybrid systems, called delay hybrid automata, to capture the dynamics of systems with the aforementioned two kinds of delays. Furthermore, based upon this model we study the robust switching controller synthesis problem such that the controlled delay system is able to satisfy the specified safety properties regardless of perturbations. To the end, a novel method is proposed to synthesize switching controllers based on the computation of differential invariants for continuous evolution and backward reachable sets of discrete jumps with delays. Finally, we implement a prototypical tool of our approach and demonstrate it on some case studies.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456657;;;Systems AND Control

The IRL method is introduced to obviate the identification procedure of the unknown drift dynamics. In order to achieve Nash equilibrium for each player, the simplified optimal control policy for each player is obtained by solving the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi equation with the critic neural network only. Thus, the computational resource is saved and the control structure is easy to realize. The closed-loop system is guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded based on the Lyapunov stability analysis.

Artificial Steganographic Network Data Generation Concept and Evaluation of Detection Approaches to secure Industrial Control Systems against Steganographic Attacks;;;['Tom Neubert', 'Claus Vielhauer', 'Christian Kraetzer'];;;August 2021;;;ARES '21: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security;;;Since industrial control systems (ICS) play an important role in our everyday life, their protection is of great importance. At the same time, security researchers observe an increasing usage of steganographic methods in IT networks used by attackers to embed hidden communication in order to stay undetected as long as possible. This leads to a novel digital threat which includes the embedding of steganographic hidden communication in ICS networks. Thus, novel detection approaches specified for steganographic attacks have to be elaborated. Detectors are often based on machine learning approaches and require training and test data. However, the embedding of sophisticated hidden communication in an ICS is a very time consuming and challenging task which currently leads to a lack of suitable training and test data for the evaluation of detection mechanisms. To address this gap, this work presents an artificial steganographic network data (ASND) generation concept for an easy generation of sophisticated steganographic network data which can be provided for the evaluation of detection mechanisms. In this paper, an exemplary data set is created by ASND generation concept and used to evaluate a state-of-the-art detector and a novel detector, also introduced in this work.

First, we introduce a method to represent neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations as the solution to a linear complementarity problem. Then, we show that systems with ReLU network controllers have an equivalent linear complementarity system (LCS) description.

In most IoT-based systems, especially those within smart-homes and smart-cities, there is a bridging point (fog computing) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks, as well as small amounts of data processing.

Synthesis-guided Adversarial Scenario Generation for Gray-box Feedback Control Systems with Sensing Imperfections;;;['Liren Yang', 'Necmiye Ozay'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;In this paper, we study feedback dynamical systems with memoryless controllers under imperfect information. We develop an algorithm that searches for “adversarial scenarios”, which can be thought of as the strategy for the adversary representing the noise and disturbances, that lead to safety violations. The main challenge is to analyze the closed-loop system's vulnerabilities with a potentially complex or even unknown controller in the loop. As opposed to commonly adopted approaches that treat the system under test as a black-box, we propose a synthesis-guided approach, which leverages the knowledge of a plant model at hand. This hence leads to a way to deal with gray-box systems (i.e., with known plant and unknown controller). Our approach reveals the role of the imperfect information in the violation. Examples show that our approach can find non-trivial scenarios that are difficult to expose by random simulations. This approach is further extended to incorporate model mismatch and to falsify vision-in-the-loop systems against finite-time reach-avoid specifications.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477033;;;Systems AND Control
Research on Real-time Virtualization Technology for Control System;;;['Xiangying Kong', 'Xinran Kong'];;;October 2021;;;CSAE '21: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Application Engineering;;;In recent years, the combination of multi-core processor and virtualization technology promotes the rapid application of virtualization technology in the field of real-time control. While virtualization technology gives full play to the performance of multi-core processors and improves the robustness and flexibility of application systems, the real-time performance loss caused by application virtualization has always been concerned by people. On the basis of discussing the concept of real-time control system, the principle of virtualization technology and the existing approaches of real-time virtualization technology, the real-time connotation of the virtualized control system is defined. This paper analyzes the real-time and applicable scenarios of two application schemes, namely, large-scale virtualization based on private cloud and single-node virtualization based on HyperVisor, the related real-time virtualization technology and application scenarios are discussed, and builds a test environment, and measures the interrupt response time and event response time of the corresponding schemes. The former can only meet the application with millisecond real-time performance, while the latter still has sub-microsecond real-time performance, which can meet most real-time system requirements.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487075.3487080;;;Systems AND Control
Authentication scheme for distributed industrial control system terminals;;;['LuYao Yang', 'WeiMing Tong', 'ZhongWei Li', 'Tong Wu'];;;October 2021;;;EITCE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Electronic Information Technology and Computer Engineering;;;In order to solve the problem of poor security protection ability of terminal equipment in current industrial control system, combining digital signature technology based on public key infrastructure and secret sharing scheme, an authentication scheme for distributed industrial control system terminal is proposed in this paper. In the process of authentication, digital signature technology based on public key infrastructure is used to deliver secret shares. The existence of the trusted center T is no longer required. This solves the problem of key escrow, prevents illegal personnel from using the name of trusted center T to deliver fake secret shares to industrial control terminal equipment, and enhances the security and reliability of the whole control system.

Simplification of the Calcine Transfer Control System Architecture for Ferronickel Projects in System Reliability Assessment;;;['Gilang Almaghribi Sarkara Putra', 'Bagus Ardiansyah'];;;May 2021;;;APCORISE '21: Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Research in Industrial and Systems Engineering;;;The Rotary Kiln-Electric Furnace (RKEF) technology is the most commonly known method for processing rich nickel ore because of its effectiveness. Before being smelted in the electric furnace, the ore must be calcinated in the rotary kiln to remove unnecessary impurities. Between these two leading devices, there is an unfailing need for effective calcine transfer system. During WIKA's first ferronickel plant project, the calcine transfer system's design was subcontracted to third parties, resulting in the supply of transfer car, hot charge crane, and hot charge system as a complete mechanical package including instrument & control system. With the three subsystems, three different PLC systems, one for each, were supplied. The presence of these local PLCs significantly decreased the reliability of calcine transfer control system. In WIKA's current ferronickel project, the calcine transfer system is done differently, taking advantage of the first project's extensive experience. The new design of instrument and control system is intended to optimize the use of primary PLC-SCADA system by removing third parties local PLC. In this paper, the current in-house design's reliability is examined and compared to the previous one. The control system architecture diagram of both designs is used to determine their corresponding fault tree model. The analysis focuses on the control system's component reliability. The top event availability values are then quantified using the Boolean algebra of the fault tree model, the failure rate and repair rate data. At the end of the study, with less local PLC, the calcine transfer system's availability is better, and it is even better if the primary PLC-SCADA system handles all the calcine transfer processes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468013.3468654;;;Systems AND Control
OVERT: an algorithm for safety verification of neural network control policies for nonlinear systems;;;['Chelsea Sidrane', 'Amir Maleki', 'Ahmed Irfan', 'Mykel J. Kochenderfer'];;;None;;;The Journal of Machine Learning Research;;;Deep learning methods can be used to produce control policies, but certifying their safety is challenging. The resulting networks are nonlinear and often very large. In response to this challenge, we present OVERT: a sound algorithm for safety verification of nonlinear discrete-time closed loop dynamical systems with neural network control policies. The novelty of OVERT lies in combining ideas from the classical formal methods literature with ideas from the newer neural network verification literature. The central concept of OVERT is to abstract nonlinear functions with a set of optimally tight piecewise linear bounds. Such piecewise linear bounds are designed for seamless integration into ReLU neural network verification tools. OVERT can be used to prove bounded-time safety properties by either computing reachable sets or solving feasibility queries directly. We demonstrate various examples of safety verification for several classical benchmark examples. OVERT compares favorably to existing methods both in computation time and in tightness of the reachable set.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586706;;;Systems AND Control

Challenges in set-valued model-predictive control;;;['Jonathan Sprinkle', 'Nathalie Risso', 'Berk Altin', 'Ricardo Sanfelice'];;;May 2021;;;CAADCPS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Computation-Aware Algorithmic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;In this abstract we describe a framework for computationally-aware computing through set-valued model predictive control. Model-predictive control (MPC) can enable multi-objective optimization in real-time, though it depends on accurate models through which future state values can be predicted. This abstract improves upon existing MPC approaches in that it considers the state to be a set (rather than a singleton in the state), allowing the trajectories to be given by a sequence of sets. The framework is beneficial for physical systems control where the uncertainty in future projection can be attributed to both model error, and environmental or sensor uncertainty, thus providing guarantees of performance, robustly. We provide an overview of the framework, and include discussion for its advantages.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457335.3461708;;;Systems AND Control

Nonparametric adaptive control and prediction: theory and randomized algorithms;;;['Nicholas M. Boffi', 'Stephen Tu', 'Jean-Jacques E. Slotine'];;;None;;;The Journal of Machine Learning Research;;;A key assumption in the theory of nonlinear adaptive control is that the uncertainty of the system can be expressed in the linear span of a set of known basis functions. While this assumption leads to efficient algorithms, it limits applications to very specific classes of systems. We introduce a novel nonparametric adaptive algorithm that estimates an infinite-dimensional density over parameters online to learn an unknown dynamics in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Surprisingly, the resulting control input admits an analytical expression that enables its implementation despite its underlying infinite-dimensional structure. While this adaptive input is rich and expressive - subsuming, for example, traditional linear parameterizations - its computational complexity grows linearly with time, making it comparatively more expensive than its parametric counterparts. Leveraging the theory of random Fourier features, we provide an efficient randomized implementation that recovers the complexity of classical parametric methods while provably retaining the expressivity of the nonparametric input. In particular, our explicit bounds only depend polynomially on the underlying parameters of the system, allowing our proposed algorithms to efficiently scale to high-dimensional systems. As an illustration of the method, we demonstrate the ability of the randomized approximation algorithm to learn a predictive model of a 60-dimensional system consisting of ten point masses interacting through Newtonian gravitation. By reinterpretation as a gradient ow on a specific loss, we conclude with a natural extension of our kernel-based adaptive algorithms to deep neural networks. We show empirically that the extra expressivity afforded by deep representations can lead to improved performance at the expense of the closed-loop stability that is rigorously guaranteed and consistently observed for kernel machines.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586870;;;Systems AND Control
A Perspective on Prioritized Tracking Control for Robotic Systems with More Outputs than Inputs;;;['Aishwarya Vinayak Rao', 'Sujay Dilip Kadam', 'Harish J Palanthandalam-Madapusi'];;;June 2021;;;AIR '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Advances in Robotics;;;Robot trajectory tracking is a pervasive requirement in many robotic applications and is an active area of research. There are a number of different approaches and algorithms available for tracking problems. However, for systems with more outputs than inputs, it is not possible to track all outputs commands independently of each other. In such a situation, one may require a subset of the outputs to be tracked more closely than others. In this paper, we explore the possibility of including an additional dynamic prioritization feature to existing linear tracking controllers. With the help of time-varying weighting matrices, one can prioritize a subset of outputs or a combination of outputs as per the needs of the application. A simple metric to quantify the expected tracking performance (incorporating the effect of prioritization) before actual implementation and measurement is also presented along with simulation results. Some preliminary results of using a similar approach of prioritized tracking in nonlinear systems using feedback linearization controllers is also presented. Finally, the use of prioritized tracking in case of quadcopter station-keeping problem under the influence of wind disturbances is demonstrated to highlight its practical utility.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478586.3478596;;;Systems AND Control
Model-based reinforcement learning for approximate optimal control with temporal logic specifications;;;['Max H.

We formulate this problem as a sequence of reach-avoid optimal control sub-problems. We show that the resulting hybrid optimal control policy guarantees the satisfaction of a given scLTL formula by constructing a barrier certificate. Since solving each optimal control problem may be computationally intractable, we take a learning-based approach to approximately solve this sequence of optimal control problems online without requiring full knowledge of the system dynamics. Using Lyapunov-based tools, we develop sufficient conditions under which our approximate solution maintains correctness. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method with a numerical example.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456639;;;Systems AND Control

Towards Activity-Centric Access Control for Smart Collaborative Ecosystems;;;['Maanak Gupta', 'Ravi Sandhu'];;;June 2021;;;SACMAT '21: Proceedings of the 26th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies;;;The ubiquitous presence of smart devices along with advancements in connectivity coupled with the elastic capabilities of cloud and edge systems have nurtured and revolutionized smart ecosystems. Intelligent, integrated cyber-physical systems offer increased productivity, safety, efficiency, speed and support for data driven applications beyond imagination just a decade ago. Since several connected devices work together as a coordinated unit to ensure efficiency and automation, the individual operations they perform are often reliant on each other. Therefore, it is important to control what functions or activities different devices can perform at a particular moment of time, and how they are related to each other. It is also important to consider additional factors such as conditions, obligation or mutability of activities, which are critical in deciding whether or not a device can perform a requested activity. In this paper, we take an initial step to propose and discuss the concept of Activity-Centric Access Control (ACAC) for smart and connected ecosystem. We discuss the notion of activity with respect to the collaborative and distributed yet integrated systems and identify the different entities involved along with the important factors to make an activity control decision. We outline a preliminary approach for defining activity control expressions which can be applied to different smart objects in the system. The main goal of this paper is to present the vision and need for the activity-centric approach for access control in connected smart systems, and foster discussion on the identified future research agenda.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450569.3463559;;;Systems AND Control

Hybrid optimal control synthesis, which aims to generate an optimal sequence of control inputs for a given task, is one of the most important problems in the field. The classical Gradient-based methods are efficient but they require the system under control should be differentiable. Sampling-based methods have no such limitations, but the ability of existing ones to solve complex control missions is restricted. In this paper, we propose a practical and efficient method to solve a general class of hybrid optimal control problems. Basically, we transform the control synthesis problem into a derivative-free optimization (DFO) problem. Then, we adapt a start-of-art classification-based DFO method to solve the optimization problems based on sampled variables efficiently. Furthermore, for complex state space, which is difficult to solve, we present a piecewise control synthesis method to make a tradeoff between optimality and efficiency by generating feasible and piecewise optimal control inputs instead. The empirical results on two complex real-world hybrid systems: a vehicle and a quadcopter drone system, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods significantly.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456658;;;Systems AND Control

Intelligent transport systems (ITS) have merged as an efficient way to overcome particularly this kind of problem in vehicular networks (VANETs) and improve performance of transportation systems. One of the solutions is to put intelligent traffic lights at each intersection of high vehicle density. In this paper, we propose a cloud computing based intelligent traffic light control algorithm, called CITLA. This algorithm aims to schedule the traffic by switching the phases of the traffic lights dynamically according to the state of the road in real time based on the conventional cloud. The Cloud has a global view on the road network since it is responsible for collecting road information via the RSUs placed on each street corner. It commutes thereafter, based on the information collected, the density of each road so as to minimize the waiting time and congestion on the roads. The results of these calculations are transmitted in real time to the RSUs which are responsible for controlling the traffic lights by changing the phases. The feasibility of CITLA was demonstrated through simulations using the discrete event simulator OMNeT++ with Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO).;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3454127.3456600;;;Systems AND Control

C3 allows developers to change the behavior and parameters of kernel locks, to switch between different lock implementations and to dynamically profile one or multiple locks for a specific scenario of interest. To showcase this idea, we designed and implemented Concord, a framework that allows a privileged userspace process to modify kernel locks on the fly without re-compiling the existing code base.

Optimizing the Performance of Containerized Cloud Software Systems Using Adaptive PID Controllers;;;['Mikael Sabuhi', 'Nima Mahmoudi', 'Hamzeh Khazaei'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems;;;Control theory has proven to be a practical approach for the design and implementation of controllers, which does not inherit the problems of non-control theoretic controllers due to its strong mathematical background. State-of-the-art auto-scaling controllers suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (1) lack of a reliable performance model, (2) using a performance model with low scalability, tractability, or fidelity, (3) being application- or architecture-specific leading to low extendability, and (4) no guarantee on their efficiency. Consequently, in this article, we strive to mitigate these problems by leveraging an adaptive controller, which is composed of a neural network as the performance model and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller as the scaling engine. More specifically, we design, implement, and analyze different flavours of these adaptive and non-adaptive controllers, and we compare and contrast them against each other to find the most suitable one for managing containerized cloud software systems at runtime. The controller’s objective is to maintain the response time of the controlled software system in a pre-defined range, and meeting the Service-level Agreements, while leading to efficient resource provisioning.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465630;;;Systems AND Control
Robustness Analysis of Dynamic Response for the Uncertain Vibration Control System Using Interval Finite Element Method;;;['ChunYan Pei', 'YingShuang Zhang'];;;October 2021;;;EITCE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Electronic Information Technology and Computer Engineering;;;The design parameters of the vibration system may be uncertain, and these uncertain design parameters may have a great impact on the dynamic response of the system. In general, the dynamic response analysis of uncertain vibration control system, when a design parameter changes once, the whole system needs to be analyzed again, which will consume a lot of computer memory and calculation time. In this paper, a fast algorithm based on interval finite element method is proposed. Instead of substituting the whole structure of the system into the control equation, the corresponding dynamic response can be obtained with the incremental characteristic matrices of the system. This method provides a new way for the robust analysis of dynamic response of uncertain vibration control system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3501409.3501577;;;Systems AND Control
On the issue of digital transformation of the state financial control by the Russian Federation Accounts Chamber;;;['Andrey Zaitsev', 'Yulia Stetsyunich', 'Oleg Kichigin'];;;October 2021;;;SPBPU IDE '21: Proceedings of the 3rd International Scientific Conference on Innovations in Digital Economy;;;The change in the socio-economic conditions during the transition to the digital economy determines the relevance of studying the transformation of the state financial control system. The article discusses the assessment results of the state financial control carried out in the context of digitalization and identifies the trends in the current economic conditions. In the course of the study, the essential role of external audit in assessing the effectiveness of the state financial resources was substantiated, the influence of the controlling work on the authorities was determined, and the interaction areas of the Accounts Chamber with other authorities in terms of using information systems (departmental information systems) were identified. The development of the state audit is considered, the specific features of state financial control in the digital reality are highlighted, and the changes in control and supervisory functions when information is the main resource and object of control at the same time are identified. Based on the analysis of publications on the development of state financial control in the context of availability and transparency of information about the budget and budget recipients in Russia and other countries, the factors have been identified that have a negative impact on the public audit as an element of the public administration system. The authors have revealed a positive impact of the development of the IT sector on increasing the transparency and reliability of the state control system, reducing the timing of control procedures, and reducing the number of control measures. The paper considers analytical indicators that reflect the results of the work of the external control body in the Russian Federation for the period from 2018-2020, which allows the authors to assess the effectiveness of control in the context of digitalization and to identify the main trends for this period. Thus, the theoretical and practical significance of the study is the author's assessment of the state financial control in the context of digital transformation and identification of trends in the development of state financial control in the future. The relevance of the study lies in the substantiation of approaches to the development of state financial control of the Russian Federation Accounts Chamber in the context of the digital transformation of the economy.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3527049.3527069;;;Systems AND Control

As the only effective way to treat liver failure, liver transportation is facing a serious shortage of donor. As an extracorporeal circulation device, artificial liver support system could effectively replace the patient's liver in a short period of time so as to improve the survival rate of patients greatly. At present, the control core of the artificial liver control system is PLC. However, with the increasing complexity of functions and demands, the control system based on PLC will gradually show some disadvantages in cost, safety, reliability, stability, real-time Performance and other aspects which will restrict the development of artificial liver.

Ensuring users can safeguard their privacy without compromising the devices’ functionality requires effective yet intuitive ways to manage personal privacy preferences. Current solutions for privacy management are severely lacking as they are ineffective in making users aware of potential privacy risks or how to mitigate them and as they offer limited support for interaction. As our first contribution, we develop a novel AR privacy management interface (PARA) that uses AR visualization to contextualize data disclosure and improve user’s perceptions of privacy threats. Besides offering support for enhancing user’s privacy perceptions, our interface supports privacy control on compatible devices through privacy-enhancing technologies. As our second contribution, we systematically study factors affecting privacy perceptions and privacy control for two device classes (smart camera and smart speaker) through a user study with N = 32 participants. Our results show that PARA’s contextualization and visualization of privacy disclosure strongly affect the participants’ privacy perceptions. For privacy control, we demonstrate that our prototype improves the participant’s capability to identify risks and provides an effective and easy-to-use mechanism for controlling privacy disclosure, in contrast to existing state-of-the-art privacy management interfaces.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462244.3479885;;;Systems AND Control

Forward build systems, formally;;;['Sarah Spall', 'Neil Mitchell', 'Sam Tobin-Hochstadt'];;;January 2022;;;CPP 2022: Proceedings of the 11th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs;;;Build systems are a fundamental part of software construction, but their correctness has received comparatively little attention, relative to more prominent parts of the toolchain. In this paper, we address the correctness of forward build systems, which automatically determine the dependency structure of the build, rather than having it specified by the programmer.   We first define what it means for a forward build system to be correct---it must behave identically to simply executing the programmer-specified commands in order. Of course, realistic build systems avoid repeated work, stop early when possible, and run commands in parallel, and we prove that these optimizations, as embodied in the recent forward build system Rattle, preserve our definition of correctness. Along the way, we show that other forward build systems, such as Fabricate and Memoize, are also correct.   We carry out all of our work in Agda, and describe in detail the assumptions underlying both Rattle itself and our modeling of it.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3497775.3503687;;;Systems AND Control
Fault Diagnosis and Fault Tolerant Control of Two manipulators Cooperation System;;;['Wei Wu', 'Zhixin Cheng', 'Rui Zhang', 'Baomei Xu'];;;October 2021;;;AIAM2021: 2021 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacture;;;In this paper, a new actuator fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed for a cooperation system composed of two manipulators. When two manipulators perform parts assembly, hole-shaft coordination and other tasks, the output of the two manipulators needs to satisfy the objective function. The occurrence of fault will cause the collaboration task to be unable to complete. Thus, a new fault tolerant control scheme is adopted in this article. Assuming that the first manipulator subsystem has a multiplicative actuator fault, an adaptive observer is designed in the first manipulator system to get fault information and the controller in the second manipulator system is redesigned to make the outputs of the two manipulators still satisfy the objective function after a fault occurs. Finally, the simulation of the two-joint manipulator officially confirmed that the algorithm is effective.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3495018.3495077;;;Systems AND Control

Reducing the configuration overhead of the distributed two-level control system;;;['Yu Yang', 'Dimitrios Stathis', 'Ahmed Hemani'];;;March 2022;;;DATE '22: Proceedings of the 2022 Conference &amp; Exhibition on Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe;;;With the growing demand for more efficient hardware accelerators for streaming applications, a novel Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) that uses a Distributed Two-Level Control (D2LC) system has been proposed in the literature. Even though the highly distributed and parallel structure makes it fast and energy-efficient, the single-issue instruction channel between the level-1 and level-2 controller in each D2LC cell becomes the bottleneck of its performance. In this paper, we improve its design to mimic a multi-issued architecture by inserting shadow instruction buffers between the level-1 and level-2 controllers. Together with a zero-overhead hardware loop, the improved D2LC architecture can enable efficient overlap between loop iterations. We also propose a complete constraint programming based instruction scheduling algorithm to support the above hardware features. The experiment result shows that the improved D2LC architecture can achieve up to 25% of reduction on the instruction execution cycles and 35% reduction on the energy-delay product.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3539845.3539877;;;Systems AND Control

A Practical Approach for Dynamic Taint Tracking with Control-flow Relationships;;;['Katherine Hough', 'Jonathan Bell'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology;;;Dynamic taint tracking, a technique that traces relationships between values as a program executes, has been used to support a variety of software engineering tasks. Some taint tracking systems only consider data flows and ignore control flows. As a result, relationships between some values are not reflected by the analysis. Many applications of taint tracking either benefit from or rely on these relationships being traced, but past works have found that tracking control flows resulted in over-tainting, dramatically reducing the precision of the taint tracking system. In this article, we introduce Conflux, alternative semantics for propagating taint tags along control flows. Conflux aims to reduce over-tainting by decreasing the scope of control flows and providing a heuristic for reducing loop-related over-tainting. We created a Java implementation of Conflux and performed a case study exploring the effect of Conflux on a concrete application of taint tracking, automated debugging. In addition to this case study, we evaluated Conflux’s accuracy using a novel benchmark consisting of popular, real-world programs. We compared Conflux against existing taint propagation policies, including a state-of-the-art approach for reducing control-flow-related over-tainting, finding that Conflux had the highest F1 score on 43 out of the 48 total tests.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485464;;;Systems AND Control

ReACt: A Resource-centric Access Control System for Web-app Interactions on Android;;;['Xin Zhang', 'Yifan Zhang'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;We identify and survey five mechanisms through which web content interacts with mobile apps. While useful, these web-app interaction mechanisms cause various notable security vulnerabilities on mobile apps or web content. The root cause is lack of proper access control mechanisms for web-app interactions on mobile OSes. Existing solutions usually adopt either an origin-centric design or a code-centric design, and suffer from one or several of the following limitations: coarse protection granularity, poor flexibility in terms of access control policy establishment, and incompatibility with existing apps/OSes due to the need of modifying the apps and/or the underlying OS. More importantly, none of the existing works can organically deal with all the five web-app interaction mechanisms. In this paper, we propose ReACt, a novel Resource-centric Access Control design that can coherently work with all the web-app interaction mechanisms while addressing the above-mentioned limitations.

Reliability Sensitivity Analysis to Frequency Stability Control System Based on Improved Probability Weighted Directed Graph;;;['Yunsong Yan', 'Nan Zhang', 'Wei Han', 'Shenghu Li', 'Jianfeng Ren', 'Chuang Song', 'Huimin Zhou'];;;December 2021;;;EEET 2021: 2021 4th International Conference on Electronics and Electrical Engineering Technology;;;Difficulty to assess the risk of the frequency stability control system (FSCS) lies in its complex structure and expected function. In this paper, a risk assessment model to the FSCS is proposed. From the improved probability-based weighted directed graph firstly established, the weighted adjacency matrix is obtained. To find the connectivity of any two nodes, the weighted fully connected matrix is introduced by the path search algorithm since the weighted adjacency matrix has no Boolean property. When assessing the risk of the FSCS, considering its hierarchical structure, redundant configuration of stations and ‘non-point-to-point’ instruction transmission characteristics, the corrected topology with N-1 contingency of the FSCS is established. Then the risk indices are defined from two perspectives of only the FSCS itself and its functional characteristics, while the latter reflects the ability of the FSCS to ensure the security and stability of the AC/ultra-high voltage DC (UHVDC) power system. The sensitivities of the risk indices to the FSCS devices and UHVDC components are quantified based on the risk assessment model. The numerical results of the typical test system are provided to validate the practical value and accuracy of the proposed model.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508297.3508330;;;Systems AND Control

“I Might be Using His… But It is Also Mine!”: Ownership and Control in Accounts Designed for Sharing;;;['Ji Eun Song', 'Jaeyoun You', 'Joongseek Lee'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;A user's ownership perception of virtual objects, such as cloud files, is generally uncertain. Is this valid for streaming platforms featuring accounts designed for sharing (DS)? We observe sharing practices within DS accounts of streaming platforms and identify their ownership characteristics and unexpected complications through two mixed-method studies. Casual and Cost-splitting are the two sharing practices identified. The owner is the sole payer for the account in the former, whereas profile holders split the cost in the latter. We distinguish two types of ownership in each practice—Primary and Dual. In Primary ownership, the account owner has the power to allow others to use the account; in Dual ownership, Primary ownership appears in conjunction with joint ownership, notably displaying asymmetric ownership perceptions among users. Conflicts arise when the sharing agreements collapse. Therefore, we propose design recommendations that bridge ownership differences based on sharing practices of DS accounts.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445301;;;Systems AND Control
Research on automatic leveling Control based on improved PID Neural Network;;;['Chusi Huang', 'Jiandong Li'];;;November 2021;;;AISS '21: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Advanced Information Science and System;;;Since the leveling system is a nonlinear multi-variable coupling system, it is difficult for the traditional control methods to achieve good control effect in the automatic leveling system. Therefore, this paper takes the four-legged structure platform as the research object and proposes the compound leveling method of the highest point stationary method combined with the inverse system decoupling control method as the leveling method. The mechatronic integration simulation model of the platform and the leg system is established by MATLAB/Simulink. On this basis, the platform is controlled by classical PID controller, classical multi-variable PID neural network controller and improved PID neural network decoupling controller.

Scalable Optimization for Wind Farm Control using Coordination Graphs;;;['Timothy Verstraeten', 'Pieter-Jan Daems', 'Eugenio Bargiacchi', 'Diederik M. Roijers', 'Pieter J.K. Libin', 'Jan Helsen'];;;May 2021;;;AAMAS '21: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems;;;Wind farms are a crucial driver toward the generation of ecological and renewable energy. Due to their rapid increase in capacity, contemporary wind farms need to adhere to strict constraints on power output to ensure stability of the electricity grid. Specifically, a wind farm controller is required to match the farm's power production with a power demand imposed by the grid operator. This is a non-trivial optimization problem, as complex dependencies exist between the wind turbines. State-of-the-art wind farm control typically relies on physics-based heuristics that fail to capture the full load spectrum that defines a turbine's health status. When this is not taken into account, the long-term viability of the farm's turbines is put at risk. Given the complex dependencies that determine a turbine's lifetime, learning a flexible and optimal control strategy requires a data-driven approach. However, as wind farms are large-scale multi-agent systems, optimizing control strategies over the full joint action space is intractable. We propose a new learning method for wind farm control that leverages the sparse wind farm structure to factorize the optimization problem. Using a Bayesian approach, based on multi-agent Thompson sampling, we explore the factored joint action space for configurations that match the demand, while considering the lifetime of turbines. We apply our method to a grid-like wind farm layout, and evaluate configurations using a state-of-the-art wind flow simulator. Our results are competitive with a physics-based heuristic approach in terms of demand error, while, contrary to the heuristic, our method prolongs the lifetime of high-risk turbines.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464109;;;Systems AND Control
Learning to Map Degrees of Freedom for Assistive User Control: Towards an Adaptive DoF-Mapping Control for Assistive Robots;;;['Felix Ferdinand Goldau', 'Udo Frese'];;;June 2021;;;PETRA '21: Proceedings of the 14th PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments Conference;;;This paper presents a novel approach to shared control for an assistive robot by adaptively mapping the degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the user to control with a low-dimensional input device. For this, a convolutional neural network interprets camera data of the current situation and outputs a probabilistic description of possible robot motion the user might command.  Applying a novel representation of control modes, the network’s output is used to generate individual degrees of freedom of robot motion to be controlled by single DoF of the user’s input device. These DoFs are not necessarily equal to the cardinal DoFs of the robot but are instead superimpositions of those, thus allowing motions like diagonal directions or orbiting around a point. This enables the user to perform robot motions previously impossible with such a low-dimensional input device.  The shared control is implemented for a proof-of-concept 2D simulation and evaluated with an initial user study by comparing it to a standard control approach. The results show a functional control which is both subjectively and objectively significantly faster, but subjectively more complex.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453892.3453895;;;Systems AND Control
Hierarchical Software Design Methodology for High Concurrency and Fine-Grained Permission Control Scenarios;;;['Yuan Han', 'Qingqing Song', 'Xinquan Huang', 'Jie Yin'];;;August 2021;;;CCRIS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 2nd International Conference on Control, Robotics and Intelligent System;;;Because complex software usually faces high concurrency and complex permission control scenarios, and there are problems with low code reuse rate and chaotic function module structure in the development process of its access control module, so providing software design methodology for such scenarios is helpful to improve software productivity and software quality play an important role. This paper proposes a hierarchical software design methodology for the development of complex software under high concurrency and fine-grained permission control scenarios. The software design methodology divides the hierarchical structure according to the characteristics of the access control process, and provides support for fine-grained control and multi-level control of permissions. For high concurrency scenarios, a cache management layer is added to improve the efficiency of the access control process. According to the actual needs of software development, the specific levels in the software design methodology are divided. By decoupling the user status detection, user status verification and permission authentication in the access control process, the support of this software design methodology in different framework environments is guaranteed and the security risks caused by the high coupling between frameworks are reduced. Through a series of 0-500K concurrent test experiments, the performance data of different frameworks in the same scenario is obtained, which provides users with a reference when implementing the software design methodology proposed in this article, enable it to choose a framework for better performance depending on the scenario it faces.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3483845.3483867;;;Systems AND Control
In-Memory Policy Indexing for Policy Retrieval Points in Attribute-Based Access Control;;;['Dominic Heutelbeck', 'Marc Lucas Baur', 'Martin Kluba'];;;June 2021;;;SACMAT '21: Proceedings of the 26th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies;;;Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) systems are using machine-readable rules for making access control decisions. Rules are collected in documents, the named policies, or policy sets. These are expressed in a specific policy language, such as XACML, ALFA, or SAPL. Within systems implementing the ABAC reference architecture, policy documents are persisted in a Policy Retrieval Point (PRP). This paper addresses the problem of efficiently retrieving policy documents applicable to a given authorization request (or subscription) from the PRP. Applicability is determined by a specific section of the document, commonly named target expression. The target expression consists of matching conditions, more precisely Boolean expressions based on request (or subscription) data. This paper presents a novel in-memory data structure that is used to index policy documents. The index allows retrieving documents matching a given authorization request more efficiently from a large set of policies. The empirical evaluation demonstrates, that the proposed algorithm can reduce policy retrieval time in PRPs by up to 98%, depending on the structure of the policies.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450569.3463562;;;Systems AND Control

To tackle this problem, an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is designed to alleviate these disturbances. Firstly, all the disturbances, including external disturbances, model mismatch and parameter perturbation rather than just direct normal irradiation, are lumped into one disturbance. And then, the lumped disturbance is estimated and rejected by an ADRC, where the order and gain of ADRC are determined based on an operating point of a nonlinear PTSF. The performance of the ADRC controller is also compared to 2-DOF-PID, and simulation results show remarkable merits in disturbance rejection and reference tracking of the proposed controller.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3484274.3484299;;;Systems AND Control
PID Tuning for Vision Based Mobile Robots Formation Control;;;['Ali Sayah', 'Jean-Francois Brethe'];;;May 2021;;;RSAE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 3rd International Conference on Robotics Systems and Automation Engineering;;;Multiple autonomous robots are more and more used in fully automated warehouses where they can operate safely sharing the same space using a simple obstacle avoidance strategy and transport objects from one area to another. For transporting large or heavy objects, it is sometimes interesting to use several mobile robots cooperating physically and keeping the same geometric formation. In this case, the control of the robots’ formation is a crucial issue. In this context, our work proposes a strategy based on an ARTAG marker tracking for building and maintaining a Leader-Follower (LF) configuration using no other communication means than indirect communication via tracking. The tracking is using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Differential) controller for the following process and AR track Alvar vision system for the recognition and localization process. The proposed method only needs distance and angle errors information during the tracking. We defined the total error during the following phase as the performance measurement to be minimized. For PID tuning, the manual tuning method is used and compared with classical PID and conventional PID tuning methods including Ziegler-Nichols method, Tyreus-Luyben method and Cohen-Coon method. Experiments are validated and conducted on two real mobile robots, the master robot carrying the marker is manually controlled and the follower is keeping its position relative to the master using the AR tag tracking.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3475851.3475852;;;Systems AND Control

By outsourcing local data and immigrating expensive workloads to cloud service providers and fog nodes (FNs), resource-constrained devices can enjoy data services with low latency and minimal cost. To protect data security and privacy in the untrusted cloud-fog environment, many cryptographic mechanisms have been invented. Unfortunately, most of them are impractical when directly applied to cloud-fog IoT computing, mainly due to the large number of resource-constrained end-devices (EDs). In this paper, we present a secure cloud-fog IoT data sharing system with bilateral access control based on a new cryptographic tool called lightweight matchmaking encryption. Our system enforces both sender access control and receiver access control simultaneously and adapts to resource-constrained EDs by outsourcing costly workloads to FNs.

On Time-sensitive Control Dependencies;;;['Martin Hecker', 'Simon Bischof', 'Gregor Snelting'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems;;;We present efficient algorithms for time-sensitive control dependencies (CDs). If statement y is time-sensitively control dependent on statement x, then x decides not only whether y is executed but also how many timesteps after x. If y is not standard control dependent on x, but time-sensitively control dependent, then y will always be executed after x, but the execution time between x and y varies. This allows us to discover, e.g., timing leaks in security-critical software.We systematically develop properties and algorithms for time-sensitive CDs, as well as for nontermination-sensitive CDs. These work not only for standard control flow graphs (CFGs) but also for CFGs lacking a unique exit node (e.g., reactive systems). We show that Cytron’s efficient algorithm for dominance frontiers [10] can be generalized to allow efficient computation not just of classical CDs but also of time-sensitive and nontermination-sensitive CDs.

ReCFA: Resilient Control-Flow Attestation;;;['Yumei Zhang', 'Xinzhi Liu', 'Cong Sun', 'Dongrui Zeng', 'Gang Tan', 'Xiao Kan', 'Siqi Ma'];;;December 2021;;;ACSAC '21: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference;;;Recent IoT applications gradually adapt more complicated end systems with commodity software. Ensuring the runtime integrity of these software is a challenging task for the remote controller or cloud services. Popular enforcement is the runtime remote attestation which requires the end system (prover) to generate evidence for its runtime behavior and a remote trusted verifier to attest the evidence. Control-flow attestation is a kind of runtime attestation that provides diagnoses towards the remote control-flow hijacking at the prover. Most of these attestation approaches focus on small or embedded software. The recent advance to attesting complicated software depends on the source code and CFG traversing to measure the checkpoint-separated subpaths, which may be unavailable for commodity software and cause possible context missing between consecutive subpaths in the measurements.  In this work, we propose a resilient control-flow attestation (ReCFA), which does not need the offline measurement of all legitimate control-flow paths, thus scalable to be used on complicated commodity software. Our main contribution is a multi-phase approach to condensing the runtime control-flow events; as a result, the vast amount of control-flow events are abstracted into a deliverable size. The condensing approach consists of filtering skippable call sites, folding program-structure related control-flow events, and a greedy compression. Our approach is implemented with binary-level static analysis and instrumentation. We employ a shadow stack mechanism at the verifier to enforce context-sensitive control-flow integrity and diagnose the compromised control-flow events violating the security policy. The experimental results on real-world benchmarks show both the efficiency of the control-flow condensing and the effectiveness of security enforcement.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485832.3485900;;;Systems AND Control
Event-triggered Suboptimal Control Based Adaptive Reinforcement Learning;;;['Tengcong Ma', 'Ruizhuo Song'];;;November 2021;;;ICRAI '21: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence;;;The paper presents event-triggered suboptimal control based adaptive reinforcement learning. Linear quadratic optimal control requires the use of all state variables feedback, but in engineering practice, not all states can be measured or easy to be measured. Therefore, suboptimal control becomes very significant. Under event-triggered (ET) mechanism, we give the expression of suboptimal control, propose a novel triggering condition and prove the stability of close-loop system. Adaptive Q-learning is a kind of reinforcement learning, which is used to structure critic network.

Control strategy of lower-limb exoskeleton;;;['Sixian Zheng'];;;October 2021;;;ISAIMS '21: Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for Medicine Sciences;;;With the growth of market demand, the global medical exoskeleton market is rapidly expanding. The continuous improvement of medical exoskeleton technology promotes the development of the market scale. In some countries, medical exoskeleton coverage has increased. The lower-limb medical exoskeleton industry occupies the largest share in the global medical exoskeleton market because it helps humans solve the most basic walking, squatting, and going up and downstairs. However, the strategy of exoskeleton control systems has always been a complex issue. This article focuses on the control system of the lower-limb exoskeleton. By investigating description product and control system details, the lower-limb exoskeleton is divided into multiple joints and single joints to discuss their control system from principle, service subjects, advantages, and disadvantages. This paper also summarizes some possible solutions to the shortcomings of the lower-limb exoskeleton in the future to estimate the future trends of technological development.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3500931.3500991;;;Systems AND Control

Rule-based optimal control for autonomous driving;;;['Wei Xiao', 'Noushin Mehdipour', 'Anne Collin', 'Amitai Y. Bin-Nun', 'Emilio Frazzoli', 'Radboud Duintjer Tebbens', 'Calin Belta'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;We develop optimal control strategies for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) that are required to meet complex specifications imposed by traffic laws and cultural expectations of reasonable driving behavior. We formulate these specifications as rules, and specify their priorities by constructing a priority structure, called <u>T</u>otal <u>OR</u>der over e<u>Q</u>uivalence classes (TORQ). We propose a recursive framework, in which the satisfaction of the rules in the priority structure are iteratively relaxed based on their priorities. Central to this framework is an optimal control problem, where convergence to desired states is achieved using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs), and safety is enforced through Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). We also show how the proposed framework can be used for after-the-fact, pass/fail evaluation of trajectories - a given trajectory is rejected if we can find a controller producing a trajectory that leads to less violation of the rule priority structure. We present case studies with multiple driving scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3450542;;;Systems AND Control
Analysis of the Frequency Interference in the Narrowband Active Noise Control System;;;['Han Wang', 'Hongling Sun', 'Jianfeng Guo', 'Ming Wu', 'Jun Yang'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing;;;The narrowband active noise control (ANC) algorithm works well in the multi-tone noise reduction system. However, the performance of this algorithm degenerates significantly when the noisy frequencies become very close (e. g. frequency gap is 3 Hz where the sampling frequency is 5000 Hz), which can be seen as frequency interference effects. Up to now, however, this effect has not been researched in detail. In this work, the frequency interference effects are analyzed and discussed. The convergence process, the noise reduction value, the stability condition and the optimum step size are obtained by extensive math formulation derivation, provided two frequencies are close and fixed. Theoretical results show that, tones with large frequency difference can be approximated to independent convergence while the system with close frequencies suffers from poor convergence rate. The value of step size plays an important role in convergence, but the interference effects could never be eliminated by adjusting step size. Simulations are conducted to verify the analysis and the results match well with the analysis.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TASLP.2022.3169623;;;Systems AND Control
On the decidability of reachability in continuous time linear time-invariant systems;;;['Mohan Dantam', 'Amaury Pouly'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;We consider the decidability of state-to-state reachability in linear time-invariant control systems over continuous time. We analyze this problem with respect to the allowable control sets, which are assumed to be the image under a linear map of the unit hypercube (i.e. zonotopes). This naturally models bounded (sometimes called saturated) controls. Decidability of the version of the reachability problem in which control sets are affine subspaces of Rn is a fundamental result in control theory. Our first result is decidability in two dimensions (n = 2) if matrix A satisfies some spectral conditions and conditional decidablility in general. If the transformation matrix A is diagonal with rational entries (or rational multiples of the same algebraic number) then the reachability problem is decidable. If the transformation matrix A only has real eigenvalues, the reachability problem is conditionally decidable. The time-bounded reachability problem is conditionally decidable and unconditionally decidable in two dimensions. Some of our results rely on the decidability of certain logical theories --- namely the theory of the reals with exponential (Rexp) and with bounded sine (Rexp,sin)--- which have been proven decidable conditional on Schanuel's Conjecture --- a unifying conjecture in transcendence theory. We also obtain a hardness result for a mild generalization of the problem where the target is a simple set (hypercube of dimension n - 1 or hyperplane) instead of a point. In this case, we show that the problem is at least as hard as the Continuous Positivity problem if the control set is a singleton, or the Nontangential Continuous Positivity problem if the control set is [-1, 1].;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456705;;;Systems AND Control
The topic model of voice interactive dialogue based on the localized command and control system;;;['Haiyan Geng', 'Baoliang Dong'];;;October 2021;;;CSSE '21: Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering;;;The core problem of the human-machine dialogue system in the localized command and control system is to understand the information of the dialogue, and then give a reasonable answer that is satisfactory to the command system commander or assist the commander in completing a certain task. Facing huge interactive dialogue and other short text dialogue data, it is necessary to understand it efficiently and accurately. Daily interactive dialogues are carried out following certain themes, and mining the hidden subject information is a good way to grasp the inherent characteristics of the dialogue. The length of the dialogue text in the daily dialogue of the commander is small, and it has a high degree of randomness. The oral language is serious. Its themes are intertwined and the organizational structure is more chaotic than the news and other types of texts, which makes it difficult for the traditional topic model to capture the hidden words. The co-occurrence law of the contained words and documents cannot be directly applied to this type of text. Therefore, this article constructs a "pseudo-long document" method for short text problems. The topic information in a group of dialogues is relatively similar, and the word co-occurrence in the dialogue is more representative. Using this method to construct the training corpus of the LDA model can improve the topic model's capture of the document-word co-occurrence law to a certain extent. At the same time, this paper proposes an index based on the combination of perplexity and topic similarity to determine the optimal number of topics. Based on these two aspects, an interactive dialogue topic model is constructed.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494885.3494892;;;Systems AND Control
Constrained Control of Quadrotor Using Laguerre Functions Based Model Predictive Control for Reference Tracking;;;['Prayag Sharma', 'Utkarsh Bajpai', 'Subir Kumar Saha', 'Adnan Jawed'];;;June 2021;;;AIR '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Advances in Robotics;;;This paper addresses the reference tracking problem of a quadrotor in presence of physical constraints using Laguerre functions-based Model Predictive Control (MPC).

PIBE: practical kernel control-flow hardening with profile-guided indirect branch elimination;;;['Victor Duta', 'Cristiano Giuffrida', 'Herbert Bos', 'Erik van der Kouwe'];;;April 2021;;;ASPLOS '21: Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems;;;Control-flow hijacking, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, remains a dangerous software vulnerability. Control-flow hijacking in speculated or transient execution is particularly insidious as it allows attackers to leak data from operating system kernels and other targets on commodity hardware, even in the absence of software bugs. Having made the jump from regular to transient execution in recent attacks, control-flow hijacking has become a top priority for developers. While powerful defenses against control-flow hijacking in regular execution are now sufficiently low-overhead to see wide-spread adoption, this is not the case for defenses in transient execution. Unfortunately, current techniques for mitigating attacks in transient execution exhibit high overheads—requiring a costly combination of defenses for every indirect branch.  We show that the high overhead incurred by state-of-the-art mitigations is mostly due to the effect of hardening frequently executed branches. We propose PIBE, which offers comprehensive protection against control-flow hijacking at a fraction of the cost of existing solutions, by revisiting design choices in the compiler’s optimization passes. For every indirect branch, it decides whether to harden it with instrumentation code or elide it altogether using code transformations. By specifically removing the heavy hitters among the indirect branches through tailored profile-guided optimization, PIBE aggressively reduces the number of vulnerable branches to allow the simultaneous application of multiple state-of-the-art defenses on the remaining branches with practical overhead. Demonstrating our solution on the Linux kernel, one of the largest, most complex and most security-critical code bases on modern systems, we show that PIBE reduces the overhead of comprehensive defenses against transient control flow hijacking by an order of magnitude, from 149% to 10.6% on microbenchmarks and from ~ 40% to around 6% on several application benchmarks.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445814.3446740;;;Systems AND Control

Application of Digital Signal Processing Technology in Intelligent Traffic Signal Control System;;;['Chuanfang Hu'];;;December 2021;;;ICASIT 2021: 2021 International Conference on Aviation Safety and Information Technology;;;With the continuous increase of household vehicles, congestion is prone to occur during peak commuting periods. At present, most cities in our country use the method of timing traffic signal conversion, that is, the signal conversion is changed by a fixed interval. However, with the increase of private cars, public vehicles, trucks and other vehicles, it is difficult to improve the current congestion at traffic intersections. Moreover, during the peak period of traffic flow, there will be a lot of vehicles in one direction, but few vehicles in the other direction. It requires traffic police to coordinate and command at the intersection and pay a lot of human capital. At the same time, when the traffic is congested or even paralyzed, the driving efficiency of emergency vehicles will be greatly affected, so a more flexible traffic signal control system is very necessary. The main analysis content of this paper is the application of digital signal processing technology in intelligent traffic signal control system. Based on the application of traffic signal system, this paper analyzes the main theories and characteristics of digital signal processing technology and combines them with it. The final result of the research shows The overall stability of the intelligent traffic control system meets the design needs.

We introduce the CAN Coach, which is a system that gives feedback to the human-in-the-loop using radar data (relative speed and position information to objects ahead) that is available on the controller area network (CAN). Using a cohort of six human subjects driving an instrumented vehicle, we compare the ability of the human-in-the-loop driver to achieve a constant time-gap control policy using only human-based visual perception to the car ahead, and by augmenting human perception with audible feedback from CAN sensor data. The addition of CAN-based feedback reduces the mean time-gap error by an average of 73%, and also improves the consistency of the human by reducing the standard deviation of the time-gap error by 53%. We remove human perception from the loop using a ghost mode in which the human-in-the-loop is coached to track a virtual vehicle on the road, rather than a physical one. The loss of visual perception of the vehicle ahead degrades the performance for most drivers, but by varying amounts. We show that human subjects can match the velocity of the lead vehicle ahead with and without CAN-based feedback, but velocity matching does not offer regulation of vehicle spacing. The viability of dynamic time-gap control is also demonstrated. We conclude that (1) it is possible to coach drivers to improve performance on driving tasks using CAN data, and (2) it is a true HCPS, since removing human perception from the control loop reduces performance at the given control objective.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3450541;;;Systems AND Control

A specific and significant example are robotic devices for rehabilitation. Despite this, an effective standardized and comprehensive method to assess force control performance does not exist. Defining the performance of a force-controlled system is not a trivial task, and one of the reasons is that performance does not only depend on the dynamics of the robot, but also on the dynamics of the environment, which are usually uncertain and time-varying. Exerting a force on a soft environment is different from exerting a force on a rigid environment. Indeed, the same force-controlled robot can have different force responses in different environments. This paper proposes a methodology to standardize the benchmarking of force control algorithms applied to different actuation architectures and considering a wide set of possible environments and disturbances, defined by the application of interest.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453892.3461332;;;Systems AND Control

A desirable goal for edge computing is pervasiveness, that is, enabling any capable and authorized entity at the edge to provide desired edge services--pervasive edge computing (PEC). However, efficient access control of users receiving services and edge servers handling user data, without sacrificing performance is a challenge. Current solutions, based on "always-on" authentication servers in the cloud, negate the latency benefits of services at the edge and also do not preserve user and data privacy. In this paper, we present APECS, an advanced access control framework for PEC, which allows legitimate users to utilize any available edge services without need for communication beyond the network edge. The APECS framework leverages multi-authority attribute-based encryption to create a federated authority, which delegates the authentication and authorization tasks to semi-trusted edge servers, thus eliminating the need for an "always-on" authentication server in the cloud. Additionally, APECS prevents access to encrypted content by unauthorized edge servers. We analyze and prove the security of APECS in the Universal Composability framework and provide experimental results on the GENI testbed to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of APECS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484804;;;Systems AND Control
Metagames and Hypergames for Deception-Robust Control;;;['Craig Bakker', 'Arnab Bhattacharya', 'Samrat Chatterjee', 'Draguna L.

Long-term, stealthy attacks such as Stuxnet can be described as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Here, we extend our previous work on hypergames and APTs to develop hypergame-based defender strategies that are robust to deception and do not rely on attack detection. These strategies provide provable bounds—and provably optimal bounds—on the attacker payoff. Strategies based on Bayesian priors do not provide such bounds.

Towards a Theory for Semantics and Expressiveness Analysis of Rule-Based Access Control Models;;;['Amirreza Masoumzadeh', 'Paliath Narendran', 'Padmavathi Iyer'];;;June 2021;;;SACMAT '21: Proceedings of the 26th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies;;;Recent access control models such as attribute-based access control and relationship-based access control allow flexible expression of authorization policies using the concepts of rules and conditional expressions. The independent nature of policy rules from each other and the amount of flexibility that they enjoy (e.g., the type of conditional expressions they support and whether they can permit or deny matching requests) make those policies quite expressive. But how expressive are they? Do we need to enable all possible flexibilities in a rule-based model to achieve the maximum possible expressiveness? Answering such questions is essential in making informed decisions when designing new models or choosing existing models for implementation. In this paper, we propose an approach towards answering those questions by developing a novel theory for capturing the semantics of rule-based policies depending on their support of different constructs such as flexibility of conditional expressions, rule modalities, and conflict resolution.

Research on Closed-loop Control of Heavy-duty Industrial Robot Based on Ultrasonic Positioning;;;['Qiang Wan', 'Congji Shi', 'Zheng Xiong'];;;June 2021;;;ICCIR '21: Proceedings of the 2021 1st International Conference on Control and Intelligent Robotics;;;At present, the industrial robots in practical application are generally controlled by open-loop control. This robot controller can't obtain the real position of the end of the robot in real time, and can't determine the deviation between the end position and the motion predetermined point, which is the disadvantage of the open-loop control of the robot. In the process of movement or processing, the heavy-duty industrial robot may bear the external force which is larger or even more than its rated load and the gravity of each arm, which makes the overall deformation of the robot structure larger, resulting in the end positioning accuracy of the heavy-duty industrial robot is not high. In view of this problem, a closed-loop control system of robot based on ultrasonic positioning technology was proposed and designed. Through the analysis and study of the composition and principle of the system, the feasibility of the system was proved in theory. Through experimental verification, the positioning accuracy of the ultrasonic positioning system was less than 1 mm. It can provide a new solution for the realization of high-precision heavy-duty industrial robot system. With the improvement of positioning accuracy of ultrasonic positioning technology in the future, the positioning accuracy of closed-loop control industrial robot will be higher and higher.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473714.3473829;;;Systems AND Control
Information Aggregation for Constrained Online Control;;;['Tongxin Li', 'Yue Chen', 'Bo Sun', 'Adam Wierman', 'Steven H. Low'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems;;;This paper considers an online control problem involving two controllers. A central controller chooses an action from a feasible set that is determined by time-varying and coupling constraints, which depend on all past actions and states. The central controller's goal is to minimize the cumulative cost; however, the controller has access to neither the feasible set nor the dynamics directly, which are determined by a remote local controller. Instead, the central controller receives only an aggregate summary of the feasibility information from the local controller, which does not know the system costs. We show that it is possible for an online algorithm using feasibility information to nearly match the dynamic regret of an online algorithm using perfect information whenever the feasible sets satisfy a causal invariance criterion and there is a sufficiently large prediction window size. To do so, we use a form of feasibility aggregation based on entropic maximization in combination with a novel online algorithm, named Penalized Predictive Control (PPC) and demonstrate that aggregated information can be efficiently learned using reinforcement learning algorithms. The effectiveness of our approach for closed-loop coordination between central and local controllers is validated via an electric vehicle charging application in power systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460085;;;Systems AND Control

AT-DIFC+: Toward Adaptive and Trust-Aware Decentralized Information Flow Control;;;['Charilaos Skandylas', 'Narges Khakpour', 'Jesper Andersson'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems;;;Modern software systems and their corresponding architectures are increasingly decentralized, distributed, and dynamic. As a consequence, decentralized mechanisms are required to ensure security in such architectures. Decentralized Information Flow Control (DIFC) is a mechanism to control information flow in distributed systems. This article presents and discusses several improvements to an adaptive decentralized information flow approach that incorporates trust for decentralized systems to provide security. Adaptive Trust-Aware Decentralized Information Flow (AT-DIFC+) combines decentralized information flow control mechanisms, trust-based methods, and decentralized control architectures to control and enforce information flow in an open, decentralized system. We strengthen our approach against newly discovered attacks and provide additional information about its reconfiguration, decentralized control architectures, and reference implementation.

Two-stage Optimal Control of Virtual Power Plant based on Improved Economic Model Predictive Control;;;['Shuai Han', 'LePing Sun', 'XiaoXuan Guo', 'JianBin Lu'];;;December 2021;;;EEET 2021: 2021 4th International Conference on Electronics and Electrical Engineering Technology;;;In order to cope with the adverse effects of the disordered operation of hydropower units on the economic operation of Guangxi Power Grid, this paper proposes a virtual power plant based on improved economic model predictive control. The model consists of two parts: day-ahead rolling optimization and intra-day real-time feedback correction. The day-ahead rolling optimization aims to maximize the operating profit of the virtual power plant as the day-a-day scheduling goal. The day-ahead large-scale scheduling plan is formulated through multi-step rolling solution, in which the prediction domain length is adaptively selected according to the wind power output prediction domain error; the intra-day feedback correction takes into account the operating cost, Use the rolling optimization stage control plan as a benchmark to adjust the operating status of the equipment to deal with the uncertain changes in the small time scale of wind power. The analysis of multi-scenario calculation examples shows that the proposed scheduling model can realize the economic operation of virtual power plants, effectively cope with the uncertainty of wind power output, and realize the controllable adjustment of hydropower units, which verifies the feasibility and correctness of the model.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508297.3508300;;;Systems AND Control
Understanding Control Frames in Multi-Camera Robot Telemanipulation;;;['Pragathi Praveena', 'Luis Molina', 'Yeping Wang', 'Emmanuel Senft', 'Bilge Mutlu', 'Michael Gleicher'];;;March 2022;;;HRI '22: Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction;;;In telemanipulation, showing the user multiple views of the remote environment can offer many benefits, although such different views can also create a problem for control. Systems must either choose a single fixed control frame, aligned with at most one of the views or switch between view-aligned control frames, enabling view-aligned control at the expense of switching costs. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between these options. We study the feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of switching the user's control frame to align with the actively used view during telemanipulation. We additionally explore the effectiveness of explicit and implicit methods for switching control frames. Our results show that switching between multiple view-specific control frames offers significant performance gains compared to a fixed control frame. We also find personal preferences for explicit or implicit switching based on how participants planned their movements.

Who's In Control?

Supporting each channel is a management framework integrated in the device and provided by different parties. For example, a device that integrates Apple HomeKit framework can be managed by Apple Home app. We call the management framework of this kind, including all its device- and cloud-side components, a device management channel (DMC). 4 third-party DMCs are widely integrated in today's IoT devices along with the device manufacturer's own DMC: HomeKit, Zigbee/Z-Wave compatible DMC, and smart-speaker Seamless DMC. Each of these DMCs is a standalone system that has full mandate on the device; however, if their security policies and control are not aligned, consequences can be serious, allowing a malicious user to utilize one DMC to bypass the security control imposed by the device owner on another DMC. We call such a problem Chaotic Device Management (Codema). This paper presents the first systematic study on Codema, based on a new model-guided approach. We purchased and analyzed 14 top-rated IoT devices and their integration and management of multiple DMCs. We found that Codema is both general and fundamental: these DMCs are generally not designed to coordinate with each other for security policies and control. The Codema problems enable the adversary to practically gain unauthorized access to sensitive devices (e.g., locks, garage doors, etc.). We reported our findings to affected parties (e.g., Apple, August, Philips Hue, ismartgate, Abode), which all acknowledged their importance. To mitigate this new threat, we designed and implemented CGuard, a new access control framework that device manufacturers can easily integrate into their IoT devices to protect end users. Our evaluation shows that CGuard is highly usable and acceptable to users, easy to adopt by manufacturers, and efficient and effective in security control.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484592;;;Systems AND Control
Toward formally verifying congestion control behavior;;;['Venkat Arun', 'Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo', 'Ahmed Saeed', 'Mohammad Alizadeh', 'Hari Balakrishnan'];;;August 2021;;;SIGCOMM '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference;;;The diversity of paths on the Internet makes it difficult for designers and operators to confidently deploy new congestion control algorithms (CCAs) without extensive real-world experiments, but such capabilities are not available to most of the networking community. And even when they are available, understanding why a CCA underperforms by trawling through massive amounts of statistical data from network connections is challenging. The history of congestion control is replete with many examples of surprising and unanticipated behaviors unseen in simulation but observed on real-world paths. In this paper, we propose initial steps toward modeling and improving our confidence in a CCA's behavior. We have developed CCAC, a tool that uses formal verification to establish certain properties of CCAs. It is able to prove hypotheses about CCAs or generate counterexamples for invalid hypotheses. With CCAC, a designer can not only gain greater confidence prior to deployment to avoid unpleasant surprises, but can also use the counterexamples to iteratively improvetheir algorithm. We have modeled additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD), Copa, and BBR with CCAC, and describe some surprising results from the exercise.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3452296.3472912;;;Systems AND Control
Full-credit flow control: a novel technique to implement deadlock-free adaptive routing;;;['Yi Dai', 'Kai Lu', 'Sheng Ma', 'Junsheng Chang'];;;March 2022;;;DATE '22: Proceedings of the 2022 Conference &amp; Exhibition on Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe;;;Deadlock-free adaptive routing is extensively adopted in interconnection networks to improve communication bandwidth and reduce latency. However, existing deadlock-free flow control schemes either underutilize memory resources due to inefficient buffer management for simple hardware implementations, or rely on complicated coordination and synchronization mechanisms with high hardware complexity. In this work, we solve the deadlock problem from a different perspective by considering the deadlock as a lack of credit. With minor modifications of the credit accumulation procedure, our proposed full-credit flow control (FFC) ensures atomic buffer usage only based on local credit status while making full use of the buffer space. FFC can be easily integrated in the industrial router to achieve deadlock freedom with less area and power consumption, but 112% higher throughput, compared to the critical bubble scheme (CBS). We further propose a credit reservation strategy to eliminate the escape virtual channel (VC) cost for fully adaptive routing implementation. The synthesizing results demonstrate that FFC along with credit reservation (FFC-CR) can reduce the area by 29% and power consumption by 26% compared with CBS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3539845.3540085;;;Systems AND Control
How to Train Your Quadrotor: A Framework for Consistently Smooth and Responsive Flight Control via Reinforcement Learning;;;['Siddharth Mysore', 'Bassel Mabsout', 'Kate Saenko', 'Renato Mancuso'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;We focus on the problem of reliably training Reinforcement Learning (RL) models (agents) for stable low-level control in embedded systems and test our methods on a high-performance, custom-built quadrotor platform. A common but often under-studied problem in developing RL agents for continuous control is that the control policies developed are not always smooth. This lack of smoothness can be a major problem when learning controllers as it can result in control instability and hardware failure.Issues of noisy control are further accentuated when training RL agents in simulation due to simulators ultimately being imperfect representations of reality—what is known as the reality gap. To combat issues of instability in RL agents, we propose a systematic framework, REinforcement-based transferable Agents through Learning (RE+AL), for designing simulated training environments that preserve the quality of trained agents when transferred to real platforms. RE+AL is an evolution of the Neuroflight infrastructure detailed in technical reports prepared by members of our research group. Neuroflight is a state-of-the-art framework for training RL agents for low-level attitude control. RE+AL improves and completes Neuroflight by solving a number of important limitations that hindered the deployment of Neuroflight to real hardware. We benchmark RE+AL on the NF1 racing quadrotor developed as part of Neuroflight. We demonstrate that RE+AL significantly mitigates the previously observed issues of smoothness in RL agents. Additionally, RE+AL is shown to consistently train agents that are flight capable and with minimal degradation in controller quality upon transfer. RE+AL agents also learn to perform better than a tuned PID controller, with better tracking errors, smoother control, and reduced power consumption. To the best of our knowledge, RE+AL agents are the first RL-based controllers trained in simulation to outperform a well-tuned PID controller on a real-world controls problem that is solvable with classical control.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466618;;;Systems AND Control

This is how a dynamic simulation is proposed that addresses elements of sugarcane cultivation considering a case of traditional plantation and another organic one to estimate the environmental effects produced by irrigation, which generates depletion of the water resource, and the control of pests and weeds that cause contamination in the soil through the application of chemicals. The proposed model was applied using the Vensim PLE software considering interrelationships between these elements. In this way, it was possible to conclude that the depletion of the water resource and the contamination of the soil is lower in organic cultivation, consuming 10.5% less water, in addition they are not considered pollutants in the soil, but in the traditional cultivation reaches 1674 l/ha. It is important to note that for the model to be able to correctly support decision-making, additional aspects that affect the yield of each type of crop, as well as its profit margin and volatility, must be considered.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3523132.3523138;;;Systems AND Control
Access control tree for testing and learning;;;['Davrondzhon Gafurov', 'Arne Erik Hurum', 'Margrete Sunde Grovan'];;;November 2021;;;ASE '21: Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering;;;We present our work on testing access control of large national e-health Internet portal which has millions of monthly visits. Our aim is twofold: (1) to improve testing by applying systematic and rigorous (semi-formal) approach and (2) to obtain holistic view of portal's complex access control structure. Applying more rigorous approach facilitates reducing ambiguity while holistic picture aids on easier and often also faster comprehension of complex access control structure. We use set-theoretic approach for specifying access control. Then, from access control's abstract set notations we derive a visual version in form of the access control tree. Nodes of the tree represent attributes that influence access while edges are values of those attributes. The leaf of the tree represents a scope which is a grouping of individual services. Access control tree presented in this paper has 15 scopes (leaves) which results in 105 pairs of abstract test scenarios. Complete version of the tree has 66 scopes that result in over 2000 pairs of abstract test scenarios. Abstract test scenarios are implemented into over 600 concrete and automated test cases. Manual execution test of one concrete test takes about five minutes while automated execution of all tests takes about one hour (thus achieving over 40 times speedup). These automated test cases run as a part of our CI/CD pipeline.

Safer adaptive cruise control for traffic wave dampening;;;['Emily Baschab', 'Savannah Ball', 'Audrey Vazzana', 'Jonathan Sprinkle'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;This project aims to develop an adaptive cruise controller for vehicles at low speeds in stop-and-go traffic. Current adaptive cruise controllers can use RADAR sensors to follow a vehicle at high speeds (greater than 18 mph), but reach their limits if the lead vehicle's velocity dips below threshold, requiring the driver of the host vehicle to resume control over the car's speed. Some cruise controllers adapt to stop-and-go traffic, but these are mostly experimental and have yet to see widespread commercial implementation. These experimental models often have issues because of their limited data; consequently, the acceleration and deceleration can be jarring and uncomfortable to passengers. In contrast, because of our reliable sensor data, and the sensor configuration unique to the CAT Vehicle, our cruise controller will be capable of following cars at low speeds and functioning continuously, even when the car is stopped.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3452003;;;Systems AND Control
Motion recommendation for online character control;;;['Kyungmin Cho', 'Chaelin Kim', 'Jungjin Park', 'Joonkyu Park', 'Junyong Noh'];;;10 December 2021;;;ACM Transactions on Graphics;;;Reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven effective in many scenarios, including environment exploration and motion planning. However, its application in data-driven character control has produced relatively simple motion results compared to recent approaches that have used large complex motion data without RL. In this paper, we provide a real-time motion control method that can generate high-quality and complex motion results from various sets of unstructured data while retaining the advantage of using RL, which is the discovery of optimal behaviors by trial and error. We demonstrate the results for a character achieving different tasks, from simple direction control to complex avoidance of moving obstacles. Our system works equally well on biped/quadruped characters, with motion data ranging from 1 to 48 minutes, without any manual intervention. To achieve this, we exploit a finite set of discrete actions, where each action represents full-body future motion features. We first define a subset of actions that can be selected in each state and store these pieces of information in databases during the preprocessing step. The use of this subset of actions enables the effective learning of control policy even from a large set of motion data. To achieve interactive performance at run-time, we adopt a proposal network and a k-nearest neighbor action sampler.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478513.3480512;;;Systems AND Control
Admission Control for URLLC Users in 5G Networks;;;['Fidan Mehmeti', 'Thomas F.

These are characterized by a high reliability of delivering packets within a short deadline. To fulfill these stringent requirements, a special care must be taken to determine the required data rate of a user, given its traffic intensity and channel conditions. Furthermore, with the network resources being limited and the competition between the users in the cell, an important question that arises is that of admission control, so that the admitted users do not experience performance deterioration. In this paper, we provide the analysis that leads to an admission control policy. We do this for two types of users in terms of their traffic intensities and channel conditions: 1) homogeneous users, and 2) heterogeneous users. We validate our results on a trace. Results show that the number of admitted users depends on the traffic intensity and the worst channel conditions.

Deep Q-network boosted with external knowledge for HVAC control;;;['Khoder Jneid', 'Stephane Ploix', 'Patrick Reignier', 'Pierre Jallon'];;;November 2021;;;BuildSys '21: Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation;;;Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems consume nearly 40% of the total energy consumption in developed countries. Traditional techniques such as rule based control (RBC) fail to control these systems in an optimal way. Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely explored in literature as well but it doesn't represent a practical solution due to the complexity of buildings' dynamics that it relies on. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great success in the domain of optimal control such as robotics and gaming. In this paper, we develop two model-free DRL approaches to optimize the energy consumption of an office while maintaining thermal comfort and good indoor air quality through controlling the radiator and the opening/closing of a window and a door existing in the office. The two DRL approaches belong to deep-Q network (DQN): the first approach represents a DQN agent with no knowledge of the environment and the second approach represents a DQN agent with initial knowledge of the environment: A hybrid approach DQN+RBC. The goal of having external knowledge in DQN agent is to boost convergence by exploiting the RBC rules. We evaluate the performance of these two approaches against an RBC approach through simulations using a physical model of the office's dynamics. Experiments show that the two DRL approaches succeeded to maintain better thermal comfort and better indoor air quality compared with RBC approach while consuming nearly the same energy.

However, our production experience in Meta’s large-scale datacenters shows that existing IO control mechanisms for block storage are inadequate in containerized environments. IO control needs to provide proportional resources to containers while taking into account the hardware heterogeneity of storage devices and the idiosyncrasies of the workloads deployed in datacenters. The speed of modern SSDs requires IO control to execute with low-overheads. Furthermore, IO control should strive for work conservation, take into account the interactions with the memory management subsystem, and avoid priority inversions that lead to isolation failures. To address these challenges, this paper presents IOCost, an IO control solution that is designed for containerized environments and provides scalable, work-conserving, and low-overhead IO control for heterogeneous storage devices and diverse workloads in datacenters. IOCost performs offline profiling to build a device model and uses it to estimate device occupancy of each IO request. To minimize runtime overhead, it separates IO control into a fast per-IO issue path and a slower periodic planning path. A novel work-conserving budget donation algorithm enables containers to dynamically share unused budget. We have deployed IOCost across the entirety of Meta’s datacenters comprised of millions of ma- chines, upstreamed IOCost to the Linux kernel, and open-sourced our device-profiling tools. IOCost has been running in production for two years, providing IO control for Meta’s fleet. We describe the design of IOCost and share our experience deploying it at scale.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503222.3507727;;;Systems AND Control
Receiver-Driven Congestion Control for InfiniBand;;;['Yiran Zhang', 'Kun Qian', 'Fengyuan Ren'];;;August 2021;;;ICPP '21: Proceedings of the 50th International Conference on Parallel Processing;;;InfiniBand (IB) has become one of the most popular high-speed interconnects in High Performance Computing (HPC). The backpressure effect of credit-based link-layer flow control in IB introduces congestion spreading, which increases queueing delay and hurts application completion time. IB congestion control (IB CC) has been defined in IB specification to address the congestion spreading problem. Nowadays, HPC clusters are increasingly being used to run diverse workloads with a shared network infrastructure. The coexistence of messages transfers of different applications imposes great challenges to IB CC. In this paper, we re-exam IB CC through fine-grained experimental observations and reveal several fundamental problems. Inspired by our understanding and insights, we present a new receiver-driven congestion control for InfiniBand (RR CC). RR CC includes two key mechanisms: receiver-driven congestion identification and receiver-driven rate regulation, which empower eliminating both in-network congestion and endpoint congestion in one control loop. RR CC has much fewer parameters and requires no modifications to InfiniBand switches. Evaluations show that RR CC achieves better average/tail message latency and link utilization than IB CC under various scenarios.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472456.3472466;;;Systems AND Control

We introduce the notion of controlling power, that represents the probability that a control configuration reaches its target. A computational method based on Monte Carlo simulations for computing the controlling power of control configurations is defined. We experimentally show that PCAFs outperform w.r.t runtime classical CAFs and in a large number of situations they can reach the target with a high probability while the classical CAFs fail.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464017;;;Systems AND Control
Admission Control for mMTC Traffic in 5G Networks;;;['Fidan Mehmeti', 'Thomas F. La Porta'];;;November 2021;;;Q2SWinet '21: Proceedings of the 17th ACM Symposium on QoS and Security for Wireless and Mobile Networks;;;Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) are one of the service types supported by 5G. These are characterized by the need to serve a large number of devices that have only sporadic traffic and which have low-energy consumption. While the non-intensive nature of the traffic does not pose much strain on efficient network planning, the requirement to serve a large number of devices certainly does. With the network resources being limited and the competition between users in the cell, an important question that arises is that of admission control, so that the admitted users can be successfully served by the network. To this end, in this paper, we provide the analysis that leads to an admission control policy. We do this for two types of users in terms of their traffic intensities and channel conditions: 1) homogeneous users, and 2) heterogeneous users. We validate our results on a trace. Results show that the number of admitted users depends on the traffic pattern but not on the channel conditions. An increase in traffic intensity by 15 times can decrease the number of admitted users by 15$ times.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479242.3487324;;;Systems AND Control
Image Analysis using Deep Learning for a Smart Traffic Control System;;;['Sourav Paul', 'S.M Rafi Alam', 'Md. Orun Sunny', 'Shaila Rahman', 'Abdullah Al Omar'];;;March 2022;;;ICCA '22: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Computing Advancements;;;Bangladesh is rapidly getting urbanized. Recently traffic jams are caused mainly because of the growing number of motorcycles and cars and it implies the violation of traffic in Dhaka City. It causes severe destruction of property and more accidents that may endanger the living of the people. Due to recent incidents, it is very risky for pedestrians and drivers to consider full safety on the road. In this research, we present the construction of a system that makes the traffic sector easier than for the traffic police to operate the system, monitor traffic violations, and take action against the violations of traffic rules. Usually, traffic rules and signal violations are monitored via traffic camera by traffic police, or sometimes it is monitored manually. However, if motor vehicle users engage in any unethical behavior, the traffic police will have a difficult time detecting it. As a result, it would be highly beneficial if machine intelligence could assist traffic police in maintaining Dhaka City's traffic integrity. The system can classify traffic violations at a street intersection and investigate effective engagement strategies to identify traffic rule violations. We are using the transfer learning technique which is a surveillance system that uses two types of pre-trained CNN keras application models which names VGG16 and ResNet50 on images to read and detect the vehicles, helmet identification, no helmet identification, and bike triple riding.

Research on Distillation Column Control Based on Improved Inverse Decoupling Active Disturbance Rejection Control;;;['Hanyin Duan', 'Jie Ren', 'Lianzhi Duan', 'Cuiping Pu'];;;October 2021;;;ICITEE '21: Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Information Technologies and Electrical Engineering;;;The distillation column process is a typical multivariable system, which is characterized by time variability, coupling and time delay. For multivariable systems, decentralized Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) can regard the coupling between channels as disturbance, which can be estimated by Extended State Observer (ESO) of each channel. For strongly coupled systems, the coupling may not be eliminated in time. Based on ADRC's excellent tracking anti-disturbance ability, an Improved Inverse Decoupling ADRC Internal Model Control (IIDADRCIMC) method is proposed by using multivariable extended state observer and making full use of the known information of the model. Decoupling of distillation column system is realized by inverse decoupling method, and improved internal model control and Linear ADRC (LADRC) are adopted for the decoupled subsystem. By introducing internal model compensator and gain to compensate time delay, the dependence of the system on the model is reduced. By adjusting the parameters of LADRC, internal model compensator and gain, the adverse effects of model mismatch, external interference and uncertainties on the system are suppressed. Simulation results show that the decoupling performance, tracking performance and robustness of the IIDADRCIMC are better than those of the conventional decentralized ADRC control scheme.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3513142.3513181;;;Systems AND Control
EMG-Based Hand Gesture Dataset to Control Electronic Wheelchair for SCI Patients;;;['Shahida Afrin', 'Hasan Mahmud', 'Md. Kamrul Hasan'];;;March 2022;;;ICCA '22: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Computing Advancements;;;This paper presents electromyography (EMG)-based hand gesture dataset to control electric wheelchair for the patient with spinal cord injury (SCI). We have recorded eight-channel surface EMG (sEMG) signals from EMG sensor placed at the forearm of the SCI patient. These signals were collected from six hand gesture-based wheelchair control movements (forward, backward, left, right, start and stop). We collected hand gesture data containing different EMG signals from 12 healthy subjects and 7 SCI subjects. Later on, The EMG signals were segmented and the time-domain feature extraction technique was applied to generate 18000 training samples and 10500 testing samples. We then classified the hand gestural EMG signals using 5 different classical machine learning models. We analyze the classification results in two ways. The first one is, training the models using only data of healthy subjects and cross-validated using data from 7 SCI patients. And the second one is by including six SCI patient’s data in the training process along with healthy subjects we performed leave one out cross-validation.

Not quite the same as the time-triggered algorithm, the developed controller is only updated when events occur. To obtain a desired performance, we develop novel triggering conditions with adjustable parameters. Therefore, a near-optimal performance can be obtained as required. Meanwhile, the system is proved to be asymptotically stable based on the developed algorithm. Besides, two neural networks are utilized to implement the algorithm. Furthermore, we test the developed algorithm with different parameter settings, and the impact of parameter settings on the performance is illustrated. Finally, we test both the time-triggered and event-triggered algorithms for comparison, which demonstrates that we obtain comparable performance with reduced computing cost.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503181.3503187;;;Systems AND Control
ACHyb: a hybrid analysis approach to detect kernel access control vulnerabilities;;;['Yang Hu', 'Wenxi Wang', 'Casen Hunger', 'Riley Wood', 'Sarfraz Khurshid', 'Mohit Tiwari'];;;August 2021;;;ESEC/FSE 2021: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering;;;Access control is essential for the Operating System (OS) security. Incorrect implementation of access control can introduce new attack surfaces to the OS, known as Kernel Access Control Vulnerabilities (KACVs). To understand KACVs, we conduct our study on the root causes and the security impacts of KACVs. Regarding the complexity of the recognized root causes, we particularly focus on two kinds of KACVs, namely KACV-M (due to missing permission checks) and KACV-I (due to misusing permission checks). We find that over 60% of these KACVs are of critical, high or medium security severity, resulting in a variety of security threats including bypass security checking, privileged escalation, etc. However, existing approaches can only detect KACV-M. The state-of-the-art KACV-M detector called PeX is a static analysis tool, which still suffers from extremely high false-positive rates.   In this paper, we present ACHyb, a precise and scalable approach to reveal both KACV-M and KACV-I. ACHyb is a hybrid approach, which first applies static analysis to identify the potentially vulnerable paths and then applies dynamic analysis to further reduce the false positives of the paths. For the static analysis, ACHyb improves PeX in both the precision and the soundness, using the interface analysis, callsite dependence analysis and constraint-based invariant analysis with a stronger access control invariant. For the dynamic analysis, ACHyb utilizes the greybox fuzzing to identify the potential KACVs. In order to improve the fuzzing efficiency, ACHyb adopts our novel clustering-based seed distillation approach to generate high-quality seed programs. Our experimental results show that ACHyb reveals 76 potential KACVs in less than 8 hours and 22 of them are KACVs (19 KACV-M and 3 KACV-I). In contrast, PeX reveals 2,088 potential KACVs in more than 11 hours, and only 14 of them are KACVs (all KACV-M). Furthermore, ACHyb successfully uncovers 7 new KACVs, and 2 of them (1 KACV-M and 1 KACV-I) have been confirmed by kernel developers.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468264.3468627;;;Systems AND Control
Design and implementation of a scenic fire detection system based on wireless network control;;;['Lai WenYa', 'Wang XinHai'];;;December 2021;;;EBIMCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 4th International Conference on E-Business, Information Management and Computer Science;;;Abstract: Most of the current fire detection systems are based on Zig Bee, WLAN or operator's 4G connections, which have the short communication distance, low capacity and high cost, and cannot meet the current and future needs of the Internet of Things for low power consumption, long distance, high capacity and low cost. In addition, these fire detection systems do not provide a good visualisation of the data and lack subsequent processing and analysis of the data. To address the shortcomings of current fire detection systems, this paper designs a Lo Ra wireless network-based fire detection system for scenic areas. (1) The Lo Ra terminal node is designed and built, including hardware design and software design. (2) The back-end system for fire detection in scenic areas is designed and built based on the Things Board framework.(3) A CNN-BLSTM algorithm model based on the attention mechanism was designed and built for environmental temperature prediction. In order to further enhance the analysis and utilisation of the data, the LSTM algorithm model was firstly built based on the characteristics of the existing collected data sources, and two levels of optimisation were carried out on the basis of the algorithm model. Firstly, to address the shortcomings that the LSTM model lacks the ability to deal with individual anomalous data disturbances and can only be trained forward to mine data links, a CNN and a BLSTM are introduced. and BLSTM pairs were introduced to extract the trend and pre/post features of temperature, respectively. Secondly, an attention mechanism is introduced to reconstruct the model for the final optimization of multiple environmental features that have different weights on temperature. The final reconstruction was carried out by combining with FNN, RNN.LSTM and CNN-BLSTM, it is concluded that the attention-based CNN-BLSTM .The results were compared with FNN, RNN, LSTM and CNN-BLSTM time-series models.

HierCC: Hierarchical RDMA Congestion Control;;;['Jiao Zhang', 'Yali Zhang', 'Zixuan Guan', 'Zirui Wan', 'Yinben Xia', 'Tian Pan', 'Tao Huang', 'Dezhi Tang', 'Yun Lin'];;;June 2021;;;APNet '21: Proceedings of the 5th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking;;;RDMA has been increasingly deployed in data centers to decrease latency and CPU utilization. However, existing RDMA congestion control schemes fail to address instantaneous large queue build-up or bandwidth under-utilization associated with frequent traffic bursty. In this paper, we argue that traffic uncertainty is the essential reason that constrains data center congestion control from simultaneously achieving high throughput and deterministic latency. Since aggregated flows within the same rack are relatively long-lived, we propose HierCC, which aggregates flows destined to the same IP in a rack and hierarchically controls the rate of flows. The rate of aggregate flows between racks is controlled by a credit-based congestion control mechanism. Then the bandwidth obtained by an aggregate flow in a rack is allocated to the corresponding individual flows from that rack promptly and accurately. We evaluate HierCC using SystemC and large-scale NS3 simulations. Results indicate that HierCC can significantly mitigate buffer usage and reduce the 99th percentile FCT by up to 20% and 40% compared with HPCC and DCQCN under a realistic workload, respectively.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3469393.3469396;;;Systems AND Control

Verification and runtime assurance for dynamical systems with uncertainty;;;['Matthew Abate', 'Mark Mote', 'Eric Feron', 'Samuel Coogan'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;In this work, we show how controlled robustly forward invariant sets for systems with disturbances are efficiently identified via the application of the mixed monotonicity property. A mixed monotone system can be embedded in a related deterministic embedding system with twice as many states but for which the dynamics are monotone; one can then apply the powerful theory of monotone dynamical systems to the embedding system to conclude useful properties of the initial mixed monotone system. Using this technique, we present a method for verifying state-feedback controllers against safety (set invariance) constraints, and our approach involves evaluating a control barrier function type condition that requires the vector field of the embedding system to point into a certain southeast cone. This approach also facilitates the construction of runtime assurance mechanisms for controlled systems with disturbances, and we study system safety in the presence of state uncertainty as well. The results and findings of this work are demonstrated through two numerical examples where we study (i) the verification of a controlled spacecraft system against a safety constraint, and (ii) the formation of a runtime assurance mechanism that functions in the presence of uncertain state measurements.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456656;;;Systems AND Control
Uncertainty-aware robust adaptive video streaming with bayesian neural network and model predictive control;;;['Nuowen Kan', 'Chenglin Li', 'Caiyi Yang', 'Wenrui Dai', 'Junni Zou', 'Hongkai Xiong'];;;July 2021;;;NOSSDAV '21: Proceedings of the 31st ACM Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video;;;In this paper, we propose BayesMPC, an uncertainty-aware robust adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm on the basis of Bayesian neural network (BNN) and model predictive control (MPC). Specifically, to improve the capacity of learning transition probability of the network throughput, we adopt a BNN-based predictor that is able to predict the statistical distribution of future throughput from the past throughput by not only considering the aleatoric uncertainty (e.g., noise), but also capturing the epistemic uncertainty incurred by lack of adequate training samples. We further show that by using the negative log-likelihood loss function to train this BNN-based throughput predictor, the generalization error can be minimized with the guarantee of PAC-Bayesian theorem. Rather than a point estimate, the learnt uncertainty can contribute to a confidence region for the future throughput, the lower bound of which then leads to an uncertainty-aware robust MPC strategy to maximize the worst-case user quality-of-experience (QoE) w.r.t. this confidence region. Finally, experimental results on three real-world network trace datasets validate the efficiency of both the proposed BNN-based predictor and uncertainty-aware robust MPC strategy, and demonstrate the superior performance compared to other baselines, in terms of both the overall QoE performance and generalization across all ranges of heterogeneous network and user conditions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458306.3458872;;;Systems AND Control

Drone Formation Control via Belief-Correlated Imitation Learning;;;['Bo Yang', 'Chaofan Ma', 'Xiaofang Xia'];;;May 2021;;;AAMAS '21: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems;;;The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has flourished various intelligent services, in which the effective coordination plays a significant role in enhancing swarm execution efficiency. However, due to the unreliable communication in the air as well as the heterogeneity in operation mode, it is challenging to achieve highly coordinated actions, particularly in the fully distributed environment with incomplete observations. In this paper, we leverage the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) technique to coordinate the drones' actions by directly imitating the peer's demonstrations. In order to characterize the true environment state under local incomplete observations, we transform historical observation-action trajectories into belief representations, which are trained in conjunction with the imitation policies. We also gain regularized belief representations by correlating the prediction of future states, the trace of historical contexts, and the action-assisted guidance information, which contribute to more accurate imitation policies. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the drones' formation control scenario.

IC differs from continuous control in that users are not assumed to use feedback to adjust their movements continuously, but only when the difference between the observed pointer position and predicted pointer positions becomes large. We use a parameter optimisation approach to identify the parameters of an intermittent controller from experimental data, where users performed one-dimensional mouse movements in a reciprocal pointing task. Compared to previous published work with continuous control models, based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence from the experimental observations, IC is better able to generatively reproduce the distinctive dynamical features and variability of the pointing task across participants and over repeated tasks. IC is compatible with current physiological and psychological theory and provides insight into the source of variability in HCI tasks.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461836;;;Systems AND Control
Time Measurement and Control Blocks for Bare-Metal C++ Applications;;;['Friederike Bruns', 'Irune Yarza', 'Philipp Ittershagen', 'Kim Grüttner'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Precisely timed execution of resource constrained bare-metal applications is difficult, because the embedded software developer usually has to implement and check the timeliness of the executed application through manual interaction with timers or counters.

After the application of these time blocks, a trace-based verification against the block-based timing specification can be performed to obtain evidence on the correct implementation and usage of the time blocks on the target platform.

Autonomous Robustness Control for Fog Reinforcement in Dynamic Wireless Networks;;;['Beatriz Lorenzo', 'Francisco Javier González-Castaño', 'Linke Guo', 'Felipe Gil-Castiñeira', 'Yuguang Fang'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communications systems will significantly rely on fog/edge network architectures for service provisioning. To realize this vision, AI-based fog/edge enabled reinforcement solutions are needed to serve highly stringent applications using dynamically varying resources. In this paper, we propose a cognitive dynamic fog/edge network where primary nodes (PNs) temporarily share their resources and act as fog nodes (FNs) for secondary nodes (SNs). Under this architecture, that unleashes multiple access opportunities, we design distributed fog probing schemes for SNs to search for available connections to access neighbouring FNs. Since the availability of these connections varies in time, we develop strategies to enhance the robustness to the uncertain availability of channels and fog nodes, and reinforce the connections with the FNs. A robustness control optimization is formulated with the aim to maximize the expected total long-term reliability of SNs&#x2019; transmissions. The problem is solved by an online robustness control (ORC) algorithm that involves online fog probing and an index-based connectivity activation policy derived from restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) model. Simulation results show that our ORC scheme significantly improves the network robustness, the connectivity reliability and the number of completed transmissions. In addition, by activating the connections with higher indexes, the total long-term reliability optimization problem is solved with low complexity.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3091332;;;Systems AND Control

Determining prioritisation of the deployment of controls and understanding their likely impact on overall cybersecurity posture is challenging, yet without this understanding there is a risk of implementing inefficient or even harmful security practices. There is a critical need to comprehend the value of controls in reducing cyber-risk exposure in various organisational contexts, and the factors affecting their usage. Such information is important for research into cybersecurity risk and defences, for supporting cybersecurity decisions within organisations, and for external parties guiding cybersecurity practice such as standards bodies and cyber-insurance companies.  Cybersecurity practitioners possess a wealth of field knowledge in this area, yet there has been little academic work collecting and synthesising their views. In an attempt to highlights trends and a range of wider organisational factors that impact on a control’s effectiveness and deployment, we conduct a set of interviews exploring practitioners’ perceptions. We compare alignment with the recommendations of security standards and requirements of cyber-insurance policies to validate findings. Although still exploratory, we believe this methodology would help in identifying points of improvement in cybersecurity investment, describing specific potential benefits.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465481.3470038;;;Systems AND Control
Optimal Control of Distributed Computing Networks With Mixed-Cast Traffic Flows;;;['Jianan Zhang', 'Abhishek Sinha', 'Jaime Llorca', 'Antonia M. Tulino', 'Eytan Modiano'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;Distributed computing networks, tasked with both packet transmission and processing, require the joint optimization of communication and computation resources. We develop a dynamic control policy that determines both routes and processing locations for packets upon their arrival at a distributed computing network. The proposed policy, referred to as Universal Computing Network Control (UCNC), guarantees that packets i) are processed by a specified chain of service functions, ii) follow cycle-free routes between consecutive functions, and iii) are delivered to their corresponding set of destinations via proper packet duplications. UCNC is shown to be throughput-optimal for any mix of unicast and multicast traffic, and is the first throughput-optimal policy for non-unicast traffic in distributed computing networks with both communication and computation constraints. Moreover, simulation results suggest that UCNC yields substantially lower average packet delay compared with existing control policies for unicast traffic.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3070699;;;Systems AND Control
Learning lyapunov functions for hybrid systems;;;['Shaoru Chen', 'Mahyar Fazlyab', 'Manfred Morari', 'George J. Pappas', 'Victor M. Preciado'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;We propose a sampling-based approach to learn Lyapunov functions for a class of discrete-time autonomous hybrid systems that admit a mixed-integer representation. Such systems include autonomous piecewise affine systems, closed-loop dynamics of linear systems with model predictive controllers, piecewise affine/linear complementarity/mixed-logical dynamical systems in feedback with a ReLU neural network controller, etc. The proposed method comprises an alternation between a learner and a verifier to search for a Lyapunov function from a family of parameterized Lyapunov function candidates. In each iteration, the learner uses a collection of state samples to select a Lyapunov function candidate through a convex program in the parameter space. The verifier then solves a nonconvex mixed-integer quadratic program in the state space to either validate the proposed Lyapunov function candidate or reject it with a counterexample, i.e., a state where the Lyapunov condition fails. This counterexample is then added to the sample set of the learner to refine the set of Lyapunov function candidates in the next iteration. By designing the learner and the verifier according to the analytic center cutting-plane method from convex optimization, we show that when the set of Lyapunov functions is full-dimensional in the parameter space, our method finds a Lyapunov function in a finite number of steps. We demonstrate our stability analysis method on closed-loop MPC dynamical systems and a ReLU neural network controlled PWA system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456644;;;Systems AND Control
Control Mode of Intelligent Cable based on Digital Twin;;;['Chenwei Pan', 'Shuming Feng', 'YongCheng Yang', 'Tianmu Hu', 'Wei Bao'];;;May 2021;;;ICFEICT 2021: International Conference on Frontiers of Electronics, Information and Computation Technologies;;;In the process of cable distribution, the utilization rate is low and the quality monitoring lags behind.

On the basis of information collection, such as location information and quality information, Markov method, Euclidean algorithm and Manthattan algorithm are applied to realize the optimal scheduling of resources. The Manthattan algorithm is used to monitor the collected quality data to verify whether the quality meets the requirements of standard quality, and the Markov method is used to analyze and predict the quality data.

Leveraging Control Flow Knowledge in SMT Solving of Program Verification;;;['Jianhui Chen', 'Fei He'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology;;;Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers have been widely applied as the reasoning engine for diverse software analysis and verification technologies. The efficiency of the SMT solver has significant effects on the performance of these technologies. However, current SMT solvers are designed for the general purpose of constraint solving. Lots of useful knowledge of programs cannot be utilized during SMT solving. As a result, the SMT solver may spend much effort to explore redundant search space. In this article, we propose a novel approach to utilizing control-flow knowledge in SMT solving. With this technique, the search space can be considerably reduced, and the efficiency of SMT solving is observably improved. We conducted extensive experiments on credible benchmarks. The results show significant improvements of our approach.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3446211;;;Systems AND Control
Dynamic and Scalable Enforcement of Access Control Policies for Big Data;;;['Marco Anisetti', 'Claudio A. Ardagna', 'Chiara Braghin', 'Ernesto Damiani', 'Antongiacomo Polimeno', 'Alessandro Balestrucci'];;;November 2021;;;MEDES '21: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems;;;The conflict between the need of protecting and sharing data is hampering the spread of big data applications. Security and privacy assurance is required to protect data owners, while data access and sharing are fundamental to implement smart big data solutions. In this context, access control systems can assume a central role in balancing data protection and data sharing. However, existing access control solutions are not general and scalable enough to address the software and technological complexity of big data ecosystems, being unable to support such a dynamic and collaborative environment. In this paper, we propose an access control system that enforces access to data in a distributed, multi-party big data environment. It is based on data annotations and secure data transformations performed at ingestion time.

Enhanced control path for repeated TCP connections;;;['Junho Lee', 'Gyeongsik Yang', 'Zhixiong Niu', 'Peng Cheng', 'Yongqiang Xiong', 'Chuck Yoo'];;;August 2021;;;APSys '21: Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGOPS Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems;;;This paper presents FALTCON that enhances the control path for repeated TCP connections. First, we measure and find that the control path of TCP stack consumes as many CPU cycles as that of the data path, which brings up the importance of optimizing the control path. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there has been little research effort on investigating the control path. Also, we observe that a significant portion of TCP traffic (e.g., HTTP) is not only short-lived but also repeated for a server and client pair. We design FALTCON to take advantage of the property of being repeated. Specifically, FALTCON re-designs the control path to remove the duplicate allocation of the structures and redundant operations over them. FALTCON is implemented in Linux 5.1 that has the latest and highly efficient networking stack. Furthermore, we optimize FALTCON to be lockless entirely and to work per-core. The experiment results show that FALTCON achieves a higher number of connections than Linux, up to 19%, and with much less CPU cycles up to 31%.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3476886.3477512;;;Systems AND Control
Automatic Camera Control and Directing with an Ultra-High-Definition Collaborative Recording System;;;['Bram Vanherle', 'Tim Vervoort', 'Nick Michiels', 'Philippe Bekaert'];;;December 2021;;;CVMP '21: Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGGRAPH European Conference on Visual Media Production;;;Capturing an event from multiple camera angles can give a viewer the most complete and interesting picture of that event. To be suitable for broadcasting, a human director needs to decide what to show at each point in time. This can become cumbersome with an increasing number of camera angles. The introduction of omnidirectional or wide-angle cameras has allowed for events to be captured more completely, making it even more difficult for the director to pick a good shot. In this paper, a system is presented that, given multiple ultra-high resolution video streams of an event, can generate a visually pleasing sequence of shots that manages to follow the relevant action of an event. Due to the algorithm being general purpose, it can be applied to most scenarios that feature humans. The proposed method allows for online processing when real-time broadcasting is required, as well as offline processing when the quality of the camera operation is the priority. Object detection is used to detect humans and other objects of interest in the input streams. Detected persons of interest, along with a set of rules based on cinematic conventions, are used to determine which video stream to show and what part of that stream is virtually framed. The user can provide a number of settings that determine how these rules are interpreted. The system is able to handle input from different wide-angle video streams by removing lens distortions. Using a user study it is shown, for a number of different scenarios, that the proposed automated director is able to capture an event with aesthetically pleasing video compositions and human-like shot switching behavior.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485441.3485648;;;Systems AND Control
Constantine: Automatic Side-Channel Resistance Using Efficient Control and Data Flow Linearization;;;['Pietro Borrello', "Daniele Cono D'Elia", 'Leonardo Querzoni', 'Cristiano Giuffrida'];;;November 2021;;;CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;In the era of microarchitectural side channels, vendors scramble to deploy mitigations for transient execution attacks, but leave traditional side-channel attacks against sensitive software (e.g., crypto programs) to be fixed by developers by means of constant-time programming (i.e., absence of secret-dependent code/data patterns). Unfortunately, writing constant-time code by hand is hard, as evidenced by the many flaws discovered in production side channel-resistant code. Prior efforts to automatically transform programs into constant-time equivalents offer limited security or compatibility guarantees, hindering their applicability to real-world software. In this paper, we present Constantine, a compiler-based system to automatically harden programs against microarchitectural side channels. Constantine pursues a radical design point where secret-dependent control and data flows are completely linearized (i.e., all involved code/data accesses are always executed). This strategy provides strong security and compatibility guarantees by construction, but its natural implementation leads to state explosion in real-world programs. To address this challenge, Constantine relies on carefully designed optimizations such as just-in-time loop linearization and aggressive function cloning for fully context-sensitive points-to analysis, which not only address state explosion, but also lead to an efficient and compatible solution. Constantine yields overheads as low as 16% on standard benchmarks and can handle a fully-fledged component from the production wolfSSL library.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484583;;;Systems AND Control

However, for current cooperative MARL methods, the cooperation team is constructed through either heuristics or end-to-end blackbox optimization. In order to improve the efficiency of cooperation and exploration, we propose a structured diversification emergence MARL framework named Rochico based on reinforced organization control and hierarchical consensus learning. Rochico first learns an adaptive grouping policy through the organization control module, which is established by independent multi-agent reinforcement learning. Further, the hierarchical consensus module based on the hierarchical intentions with consensus constraint is introduced after team formation. Simultaneously, utilizing the hierarchical consensus module and a self-supervised intrinsic reward enhanced decision module, the proposed cooperative MARL algorithm Rochico can output the final diversified multi-agent cooperative policy.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464045;;;Systems AND Control

Video analytics applications have been traditionally associated to the processing of video streams generated by fixed video cameras. Nowadays, however, the availability of mobile video cameras has become pervasive. We argue that to take advantage of the presence of mobile video cameras---and their informative content---it may be necessary to refactor the edge orchestration logic. We propose a new solution that splits the problem into two connected actions: 1) Placement of processing functions in the infrastructure and 2) Admission of most informative cameras based on their field of view. We hence describe a possible scheme for joint video stream admission and orchestration. Finally, preliminary numerical results are presented, demonstrating that separating the two logic components can improve coverage while reducing the cost of deployment.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477083.3480151;;;Systems AND Control

Learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant building HVAC control with model-assisted learning;;;['Shichao Xu', 'Yangyang Fu', 'Yixuan Wang', "Zheng O'Neill", 'Qi Zhu'];;;November 2021;;;BuildSys '21: Proceedings of the 8th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation;;;As people spend up to 87% of their time indoors, intelligent Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are essential for maintaining occupant comfort and reducing energy consumption. These HVAC systems in smart buildings rely 'on real-time sensor readings, which in practice often suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of indoor environment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the increase of energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been proposed in the literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop accurate physical models for ensuring their performance and even more challenging to address the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a novel learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which includes three deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature proposals with the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of the proposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying reinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to address the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks, we propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of building physical dynamics. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed fault-tolerant HVAC control framework can significantly reduce building temperature violations under a variety of sensor fault patterns while maintaining energy efficiency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486611.3486644;;;Systems AND Control

Development of models and algorithms for optimal motion control of absolutely rigid and deformable bodies and systems is an urgent task. Basing on the reverse optimality principle (ROP), class of skew-symmetric controls for the translational and rotational motion of elastic systems with a finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom was found.

Optimal mixed discrete-continuous planning for linear hybrid systems;;;['Jingkai Chen', 'Brian C.

Meanwhile, generating high-quality solutions given certain hybrid planning specifications is crucial to building high-performance hybrid systems. However, since hybrid planning is challenging in general, most methods use greedy search that is guided by various heuristics, which is neither complete nor optimal and often falls into blind search towards an infinite-action plan. In this paper, we present a hybrid automaton planning formalism and propose an optimal approach that encodes this planning problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) by fixing the action number of automaton runs. We also show an extension of our approach for reasoning over temporally concurrent goals. By leveraging an efficient MILP optimizer, our method is able to generate provably optimal solutions for complex mixed discrete-continuous planning problems within a reasonable time. We use several case studies to demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our hybrid planning method and show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art hybrid planner, Scotty, in both efficiency and solution qualities.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456654;;;Systems AND Control
Access Control Mechanisms in Named Data Networks: A Comprehensive Survey;;;['Boubakr Nour', 'Hakima Khelifi', 'Rasheed Hussain', 'Spyridon Mastorakis', 'Hassine Moungla'];;;None;;;ACM Computing Surveys;;;Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has recently emerged as a prominent candidate for the Future Internet Architecture (FIA) that addresses existing issues with the host-centric communication model of the current TCP/IP-based Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN architectures that provides a clean-slate approach for Internet communication. NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to the content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects, Access Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular content. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive communication and decouple the content from its original location. This phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content, causing different challenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date, considerable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In this article, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first summarize the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to content-based security, and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in NDN. We then classify the existing AC mechanisms into two main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent AC. Each category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g., Attribute-based AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC). Finally, we present the lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges of NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research directions for the community.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442150;;;Systems AND Control

Finite-Set Model Predictive Control of Melanoma Cancer Treatment Using Signaling Pathway Inhibitor of Cancer Stem Cell;;;['Afsaneh Javadi', 'Faezeh Keighobadi', 'Vahab Nekoukar', 'Marzieh Ebrahimi'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics;;;Drug delivery is one of the most important issues in the treatment of cancer and surviving the patient. Recently, with a combination of mathematical models of the tumor growth and control theory, optimal drug delivery can be planned, individually. The goal is reducing the tumor volume with minimum side effects on the patient. One of the most important challenges of the modeling is considering the drug resistance, which may lead to failure of the treatment. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed for describing the growth dynamics of the melanoma tumor cells. It is assumed that the melanoma cancer is treated with Notch signaling pathway inhibitors of the cancer stem cells. The model parameters are identified based on experimental data obtained from 13 male nude mice with an induced melanoma cancer involved in a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) program. The mathematical model is used to determine if DAPT can reduce the growth rate of the tumor. Then an optimal drug delivery plan for the treatment of every animal model is presented, individually using finite-set model predictive control method.

A Hybrid Receiver-side Congestion Control Scheme for Web Real-time Communication;;;['Bo Wang', 'Yuan Zhang', 'Size Qian', 'Zipeng Pan', 'Yuhong Xie'];;;June 2021;;;MMSys '21: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference;;;Web real-time communication (WebRTC) employs congestion control to ensure the quality of experience (QoE). Different from congestion control schemes for TCP, WebRTC keeps a low-level playback buffer that considers excessively delayed packets as losses, which makes the congestion control for WebRTC more challenging. Existing heuristic schemes estimate the network conditions based on hand-crafted rules that may be suboptimal, leading to under-utilization or over-utilization of link capacity in many cases. On the other hand, the existing learning-based schemes train a model that acts in a large action space, which is hard to converge to a stable status and has low performance over unpredictable network conditions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid receiver-side congestion control (HRCC) framework, which combines a heuristic congestion control scheme with an RL-Agent that periodically generates a gain coefficient to tune the bandwidth estimated by the heuristic scheme. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the HRCC's RL-Agent effectively tunes the bandwidth estimate of the heuristic scheme. The hybrid scheme achieves higher bandwidth utilization than the fully heuristic scheme with similar queuing delay and packet loss and outperforms the fully RL-based scheme on overall performance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458305.3479970;;;Systems AND Control
Real-time Subsurface Control Variates: Temporally Stable Adaptive Sampling;;;['Tiantian Xie', 'Marc Olano'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques;;;Real-time adaptive sampling is a new technique recently proposed for efficient importance sampling in realtime Monte Carlo sampling in subsurface scattering. It adaptively places samples based on variance tracking to help escape the uncanny valley of subsurface rendering. However, the occasional performance drop due to temporal lighting dynamics (e.g., guns or lights turning on and off) could hinder adoption in games or other applications where smooth high frame rate is preferred. In this paper we propose a novel usage of Control Variates (CV) in the sample domain instead of shading domain to maintain a consistent low pass time. Our algorithm seamlessly reduces to diffuse with zero scattering samples for sub-pixel scattering. We propose a novel joint-optimization algorithm for sample count and CV coefficient estimation. The main enabler is our novel time-variant covariance updating method that helps remove the effect of recent temporal dynamics from variance tracking. Since bandwidth is critical in real-time rendering, a solution without adding any extra textures is also provided.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3451265;;;Systems AND Control

Self-healing robust neural networks via closed-loop control;;;['Zhuotong Chen', 'Qianxiao Li', 'Zheng Zhang'];;;None;;;The Journal of Machine Learning Research;;;Despite the wide applications of neural networks, there have been increasing concerns about their vulnerability issue. While numerous attack and defense techniques have been developed, this work investigates the robustness issue from a new angle: can we design a self-healing neural network that can automatically detect and fix the vulnerability issue by itself? A typical self-healing mechanism is the immune system of a human body. This biology-inspired idea has been used in many engineering designs but has rarely been investigated in deep learning. This paper considers the post-training self-healing of a neural network, and proposes a closed-loop control formulation to automatically detect and fix the errors caused by various attacks or perturbations. We provide a margin-based analysis to explain how this formulation can improve the robustness of a classifier. To speed up the inference, we convert the optimal control problem to Pontryagon's Maximum Principle and solve it via the method of successive approximation. Lastly, we present an error estimation of the proposed framework for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions. We validate the performance of several network architectures against various perturbations. Since the self-healing method does not need a-priori information about data perturbations or attacks, it can handle a broad class of unforeseen perturbations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586908;;;Systems AND Control

The agility and responsiveness of deep network policies are influenced by many factors, such as the composition of training datasets, the architecture of network models, and learning algorithms that involve many threshold values, weights, and hyper-parameters. In this paper, we present a novel teacher-student framework to learn time-critically responsive policies, which guarantee the time-to-completion between user inputs and their associated responses regardless of the size and composition of the motion databases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with interactive characters that can respond to the user's control quickly while performing agile, highly dynamic movements.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450626.3459826;;;Systems AND Control
PSec: Programming Secure Distributed Systems using Enclaves;;;['Shivendra Kushwah', 'Ankush Desai', 'Pramod Subramanyan', 'Sanjit A. Seshia'];;;May 2021;;;ASIA CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;We introduce PSec, a domain-specific language for programming secure distributed systems. PSec is a state-machine based programming language with information flow control capabilities that leverages Intel SGX enclaves to provide security guarantees at runtime. Combining state machines and information flow control with hardware enclaves enables programmers to build complex distributed systems without inadvertently leaking sensitive information to adversaries. We formally prove the security properties of PSec and evaluate our work by programming several real-world examples, including One Time Passcode and Secure Electronic Voting systems. We present performance results of PSec systems and show that there is an acceptable performance overhead of approximately 3x for long running systems with a possible minimum of approximately 1.2x, as compared to baseline systems that do not provide any security guarantees.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3433210.3453113;;;Systems AND Control
Scheduling and controlling multiple vehicles on a common track in high-powered automated vehicle storage and retrieval systems;;;['Andreas Habl', 'Andrei Evseev', 'Johannes Fottner'];;;December 2021;;;WSC '21: Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference;;;The ongoing trend towards increased throughput capacity and scalability of automated warehouses is pushing the application of rail-guided automated vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVSRSs). By deploying more vehicles on each tier and lifting system, the performance and adaptability of these systems can be further increased. However, the transformation into high-powered AVSRSs requires advanced algorithms to run the system in a robust and efficient manner. In this work, an approach to schedule and control multiple vehicles on a common track by using a tier of a high-powered AVSRS is presented. By running computational experiments, it can be shown that the developed algorithm enables a collision-free and fast execution of transport tasks. By deploying several vehicles on a tier, the completion time of the transport tasks can be decreased and, hence, the throughput capacity of the tier can be increased.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3522802.3522890;;;Systems AND Control

A holistic review on advanced bi-directional EV charging control algorithms;;;['Xiaoying Tang', 'Chenxi Sun', 'Suzhi Bi', 'Shuoyao Wang', 'Angela Yingjun Zhang'];;;November 2021;;;ACM SIGEnergy Energy Informatics Review;;;The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has promised a next-generation transportation system with reduced carbon emission. The fast development of EVs and charging facilities is driving the evolution of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV). IoEV benefits from both smart grid and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies which provide advanced bi-directional charging services and real-time data processing capability, respectively. The major design challenges of the IoEV charging control lie in the randomness of charging events and the mobility of EVs. In this article, we present a holistic review on advanced bi-directional EV charging control algorithms. For Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), we introduce the charging control problem in two scenarios: 1) Operation of a single charging station and 2) Operation of multiple charging stations in coupled transportation and power networks. For Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), we discuss how EVs can perform energy trading in the electricity market and provide ancillary services to the power grid. Besides, a case study is provided to illustrate the economic benefit of the joint optimization of routing and charging scheduling of multiple EVs in the IoEV. Last but not the least, we will highlight some open problems and future research directions of charging scheduling problems for IoEVs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508467.3508474;;;Systems AND Control

This algorithm optimizes the variable step-size convergence coefficient by constructing a feedback error variable signal, and by eliminating the non-zero offset problem of the system. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the balance between convergence speed, tracking rate, and steady-state error. The experimental results show that the EV-FxLMS algorithm has a strong noise reduction ability for the single-frequency or mixed-frequency noise of trains below 500 Hz.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474198.3478164;;;Systems AND Control

Decentralized Collaborative Version Control;;;['Bulat Nasrulin', 'Johan Pouwelse'];;;December 2021;;;DICG'21: Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Distributed Infrastructure for Common Good;;;Decentralized systems offer alternatives to Big Tech. However, maintaining availability and correctness despite faults and manipulations in decentralized settings is challenging. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative model that is capable of exposing all observable lying, all cheating, and all faults, while only requiring merely unreliable message exchange. Our model is based on conflicting operations on arbitrary data, set reconciliation, and conflict resolution strategies to deal with branches. It is sufficiently general to support applications like Wikipedia, Github, and Datahub in a non-profit, collaborative, and decentralized form. Our protocol guarantees strong convergence despite any Byzantine nodes. We exhibit four conflict resolution strategies that cover the spectrum of possible use cases. A remarkable property of our model is that two honest nodes are guaranteed to converge despite an arbitrary-large number of faulty nodes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3493426.3493824;;;Systems AND Control

Content-Aware Playback Speed Control for Low-Latency Live Streaming of Sports;;;['Omer F. Aladag', 'Deniz Ugur', 'Mehmet N. Akcay', 'Ali C. Begen'];;;June 2021;;;MMSys '21: Proceedings of the 12th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference;;;There are two main factors that determine the viewer experience during the live streaming of sports content: latency and stalls. Latency should be low and stalls should not occur. Yet, these two factors work against each other and it is not trivial to strike the best trade-off between them. One of the best tools we have today to manage this trade-off is the adaptive playback speed control. This tool allows the streaming client to slow down the playback when there is a risk of stalling and increase the playback when there is no risk of stalling but the live latency is higher than desired. While adaptive playback generally works well, the artifacts due to the changes in the playback speed should preferably be unnoticeable to the viewers. However, this mostly depends on the portion of the audio/video content subject to the playback speed change. In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art by developing a content-aware playback speed control (CAPSC) algorithm and demonstrate a number of examples showing its significance. We make the running code available and provide a demo page hoping that it will be a useful tool for the developers and content providers.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458305.3478437;;;Systems AND Control

Physics-Based Motion Control Through DRL’s Reward Functions;;;['Antonio Santos de Sousa', 'Rubens Fernandes Nunes', 'Creto Augusto Vidal', 'Joaquim Bento Cavalcante-Neto', 'Danilo Borges da Silva'];;;October 2021;;;SVR'21: Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality;;;Producing natural physically-based motions of articulated characters is a challenging problem. The animator needs to figure out high-dimensional parameters of a motion controller to get good visual quality, while still having to deal with the basic functioning of the controller. However, those parameters generally have an unintuitive relationship with the resulting motion. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been recently explored to solve such problem. With DRL, it is possible to set a neural network with observation and action parameters and control the animation through a reward function. Nevertheless, choosing good parameters and a reward function is not a simple task. In this paper, we investigate how the animator can control the motion by manipulating simple reward functions. We propose a control structure with DRL, in which the reward function can be adapted to the desired motion and to the morphology of the controlled character. Moreover, we introduce speed in the training process so that, after training the neural network, the character is able to adapt its motion to different speeds in real time. Through a series of tests, we assess animation and speed controls of characters with different morphologies.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488162.3488217;;;Systems AND Control
Comparison between fixed and moving control system algorithms to reduce loss in data and voice applications through the Internet;;;['Mohamed S. kuafi', 'Salwa Almoshity', 'Abdulsalam Mohammed'];;;October 2021;;;ICEMIS'21: The 7th International Conference on Engineering &amp; MIS 2021;;;Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a modern way to communicate. It is a technology that allows users to make phone calls over an IP network. This is due to the high cost of communication via cellular phones, so it was necessary for telecommunications companies to develop this technology and add services that are cost-effective and provide the appropriate service. This paper focuses on the effect of packet loss on quality of service. Voice packets may be dropped and voip guarantees high-quality voice transmission only if signal packets and voice channels have priority over other types of network traffic. This paper provides a brief introduction to improve the performance for the network and enhance the voice quality by control the threshold parameter in the buffers and minimize the packet loss through VOIP networks. Buffer Jitter is a common data area where audio packets can be collected, stored, and sent to the sound processor at evenly spaced intervals. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for the buffer management scheme called push out with constant threshold (PDT) of the common buffer switch. As well as an investigation of the performance of the buffer threshold scheme by simulation. This scheme regulates the use of the shared buffer space through the use of a fixed-threshold packet acceptance. Also, an algorithm has been developed to improve the adaptive buffer allocation scheme for traffic based on the loss of successive packets in the data flow and the buffer occupancy level by making the buffer threshold dynamic. The buffer is designed to allow the input traffic to be divided into different priority classes and based on the behavior of the input traffic controls the threshold dynamically. The results of this research by comparing the static and dynamic buffer threshold algorithm show an improvement in sound quality by reducing the loss of successive packets. Congestion across the network can be reduced by using the modified MSPBs scheme. The modified MSPBs scheme not only improves voice quality and reduces packet loss, but also increases network efficiency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492547.3492611;;;Systems AND Control

FastCFI: Real-time Control-Flow Integrity Using FPGA without Code Instrumentation;;;['Lang Feng', 'Jeff Huang', 'Jiang Hu', 'Abhijith Reddy'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems;;;Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is an effective defense technique against a variety of memory-based cyber attacks. CFI is usually enforced through software methods, which entail considerable performance overhead. Hardware-based CFI techniques can largely avoid performance overhead, but typically rely on code instrumentation, forming a non-trivial hurdle to the application of CFI. Taking advantage of the tradeoff between computing efficiency and flexibility of FPGA, we develop FastCFI, an FPGA-based CFI system that can perform fine-grained and stateful checking without code instrumentation. We also propose an automated Verilog generation technique that facilitates fast deployment of FastCFI, and a compression algorithm for reducing the hardware expense. Experiments on popular benchmarks confirm that FastCFI can detect fine-grained CFI violations over unmodified binaries. When using FastCFI on prevalent benchmarks, we demonstrate its capability to detect fine-grained CFI violations in unmodified binaries, while incurring an average of 0.36% overhead and a maximum of 2.93% overhead.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458471;;;Systems AND Control
Site-to-site internet traffic control;;;['Frank Cangialosi', 'Akshay Narayan', 'Prateesh Goyal', 'Radhika Mittal', 'Mohammad Alizadeh', 'Hari Balakrishnan'];;;April 2021;;;EuroSys '21: Proceedings of the Sixteenth European Conference on Computer Systems;;;Queues allow network operators to control traffic: where queues build, they can enforce scheduling and shaping policies. In the Internet today, however, there is a mismatch between where queues build and where control is most effectively enforced; queues build at bottleneck links that are often not under the control of the data sender. To resolve this mismatch, we propose a new kind of middlebox, called Bundler. Bundler uses a novel inner control loop between a sendbox (in the sender's site) and a receivebox (in the receiver's site) to determine the aggregate rate for the bundle, leaving the end-to-end connections and their control loops intact. Enforcing this sending rate ensures that bottleneck queues that would have built up from the bundle's packets now shift from the bottleneck to the sendbox. This enables the sendbox to exercise control over its traffic by scheduling packets according to any policy necessary to achieve the network operator's higher-level objectives. We have implemented Bundler in Linux and evaluated it with real-world and emulation experiments. We find that Bundler allows the sender-chosen policy to be effective: when configured to implement Stochastic Fairness Queueing (SFQ), it improves median flow completion time (FCT) by between 28% and 97% across various scenarios.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456260;;;Systems AND Control
A Current-limiting Control Drive Circuit for DC Motor Start-up and Blocking;;;['Bingjie Chen', 'Changpei Qiu'];;;April 2021;;;RobCE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Robotics and Control Engineering;;;When the DC motor starts, the motor is stationary, the induction potential on the armature is zero, and the motor current rises quickly to produce a large inrush current, which will not only cause damage to the unit equipment but also cause perturbation of the power supply. In addition, in some applications encountered in the motor blocked rotation, electrical energy is fully converted to armature and MOSFET transistor thermal energy, accelerating the aging of the armature enamel wire, reducing the service life of the motor. In order to solve the problem of excessive inrush current when starting and blocking the motor, this paper presents an H-bridge a current-limiting control drive circuit for DC motor start-up and blocking. The circuit designed in this paper adds a current detection circuit to the driving circuit, and uses the parasitic inductance of the motor armature to effectively limit the peak current of the motor through the control of a fixed shutdown time to achieve the current limiting effect.

A general lower bound is constructed in terms of an active-rate-weighted average of the asymptotic infima of the traces of these Jacobian matrices. For switched systems with diagonal modes, we construct upper and lower bounds that only depend on the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrices, their relative order among individual modes, and the active rates. For both cases, we also construct more conservative upper bounds that require less information on the switching, with their relations illustrated by numerical examples of a switched Lotka-Volterra ecosystem model.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456642;;;Systems AND Control

Touchscreen Typing As Optimal Supervisory Control;;;['Jussi Jokinen', 'Aditya Acharya', 'Mohammad Uzair', 'Xinhui Jiang', 'Antti Oulasvirta'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;Traditionally, touchscreen typing has been studied in terms of motor performance. However, recent research has exposed a decisive role of visual attention being shared between the keyboard and the text area. Strategies for this are known to adapt to the task, design, and user. In this paper, we propose a unifying account of touchscreen typing, regarding it as optimal supervisory control. Under this theory, rules for controlling visuo-motor resources are learned via exploration in pursuit of maximal typing performance. The paper outlines the control problem and explains how visual and motor limitations affect it. We then present a model, implemented via reinforcement learning, that simulates co-ordination of eye and finger movements. Comparison with human data affirms that the model creates realistic finger- and eye-movement patterns and shows human-like adaptation. We demonstrate the model’s utility for interface development in evaluating touchscreen keyboard designs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445483;;;Systems AND Control

Control Effectiveness: a Capture-the-Flag Study;;;['Arnau Erola', 'Louise Axon', 'Alastair Janse van Rensburg', 'Ioannis Agrafiotis', 'Michael Goldsmith', 'Sadie Creese'];;;August 2021;;;ARES '21: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security;;;As cybersecurity breaches continue to increase in number and cost, and the demand for cyber-insurance rises, the ability to reason accurately about an organisation’s residual risk is of paramount importance. Security controls are integral to risk practice and decision-making: organisations deploy controls in order to reduce their risk exposure, and cyber-insurance companies provide coverage to these organisations based on their cybersecurity posture. Therefore, in order to reason about an organisation’s residual risk, it is critical to possess an accurate understanding of the controls organisations have in place and of the influence that these controls have on the likelihood that organisations will be harmed by a cyber-incident. Supporting evidence, however, for the effectiveness of controls is often lacking. With the aim of enriching internal threat data, in this article we explore a practical exercise in the form of a capture-the-flag (CTF) study. We experimented with a set of security controls and invited four professional penetration testers to solve the challenges. The results indicate that CTFs are a viable path for enriching threat intelligence and examining security controls, enabling us to begin to theorise about the relative effectiveness of certain risk controls on the face of threats, and to provide some recommendations for strengthening the cybersecurity posture.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465481.3470095;;;Systems AND Control

Primary-space Adaptive Control Variates Using Piecewise-polynomial Approximations;;;['Miguel Crespo', 'Adrian Jarabo', 'Adolfo Muñoz'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Graphics;;;We present an unbiased numerical integration algorithm that handles both low-frequency regions and high-frequency details of multidimensional integrals. It combines quadrature and Monte Carlo integration by using a quadrature-based approximation as a control variate of the signal. We adaptively build the control variate constructed as a piecewise polynomial, which can be analytically integrated, and accurately reconstructs the low-frequency regions of the integrand. We then recover the high-frequency details missed by the control variate by using Monte Carlo integration of the residual. Our work leverages importance sampling techniques by working in primary space, allowing the combination of multiple mappings; this enables multiple importance sampling in quadrature-based integration. Our algorithm is generic and can be applied to any complex multidimensional integral. We demonstrate its effectiveness with four applications with low dimensionality: transmittance estimation in heterogeneous participating media, low-order scattering in homogeneous media, direct illumination computation, and rendering of distribution effects. Finally, we show how our technique is extensible to integrands of higher dimensionality by computing the control variate on Monte Carlo estimates of the high-dimensional signal, and accounting for such additional dimensionality on the residual as well. In all cases, we show accurate results and faster convergence compared to previous approaches.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450627;;;Systems AND Control

A General Trust Framework for Multi-Agent Systems;;;['Mingxi Cheng', 'Chenzhong Yin', 'Junyao Zhang', 'Shahin Nazarian', 'Jyotirmoy Deshmukh', 'Paul Bogdan'];;;May 2021;;;AAMAS '21: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems;;;Transportation systems of the future can be best modeled as multi-agent systems. A number of coordination protocols such as autonomous intersection management (AIM), adaptive cooperative traffic light control (TLC), cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), among others have been developed with the goal of improving the safety and efficiency of such systems. The overall goal in these systems is to provide behavioral guarantees under the assumption that the participating agents work in concert with a centralized (or distributed) coordinator. While there is work on analyzing such systems from a security perspective, we argue that there is limited work on quantifying trustworthiness of individual agents in a multi-agent system. We propose a framework that uses an epistemic logic to quantify trustworthiness of agents, and embed the use of quantitative trustworthiness values into control and coordination policies. Our modified control policies can help the multi-agent system improve its safety in the presence of untrustworthy agents (and under certain assumptions, including malicious agents). We empirically show the effectiveness of our proposed trust framework by embedding it into AIM, TLC, and CACC platooning algorithms. In our experiments, our trust framework accurately detects attackers in CACC platoons; mitigates the effect of untrustworthy agents in AIM; and trust-aware TLC and AIM reduce collisions in all cases compared to the vanilla versions of these algorithms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3463996;;;Systems AND Control
Game Theory-driven Rate Control for 360-Degree Video Coding;;;['Tiesong Zhao', 'Jielian Lin', 'Yanjie Song', 'Xu Wang', 'Yuzhen Niu'];;;October 2021;;;MM '21: Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia;;;The 360-degree video (omnidirectional video) has become popular recently due to its capability of providing immersive experience, which is generally achieved via spherical moving pictures with freedom of viewpoint changing. Nevertheless, the support of full-view visual contents has inevitably reshaped its perceptual quality metric and dramatically increased its bitrate output after video coding. Therefore in 360-degree video coding, the Rate Control (RC) problem, which aims to maximize the resulted perceptual quality under bitrate constraint, has become a challenging task yet to be addressed. In this paper, we observe a latitude-based bitrate discrepancy in equirectangular-projected 360-degree video coding and further utilize this feature in bitrate allocation under panoramic vision. We introduce game theory to find optimal inter/intra-frame bit allocations that maximize the overall RC performance in terms of utility function. Finally, an overall framework is proposed that is capable of providing both an improved bitrate accuracy and an enhanced perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of proposed method, with promising RC performances for 4K and 8K 360-degree videos.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475657;;;Systems AND Control

Attribute-specific Control Units in StyleGAN for Fine-grained Image Manipulation;;;['Rui Wang', 'Jian Chen', 'Gang Yu', 'Li Sun', 'Changqian Yu', 'Changxin Gao', 'Nong Sang'];;;October 2021;;;MM '21: Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia;;;Image manipulation with StyleGAN has been an increasing concern in recent years. Recent works have achieved tremendous success in analyzing several semantic latent spaces to edit the attributes of the generated images. However, due to the limited semantic and spatial manipulation precision in these latent spaces, the existing endeavors are defeated in fine-grained StyleGAN image manipulation, i.e., local attribute translation. To address this issue, we discover attribute-specific control units, which consist of multiple channels of feature maps and modulation styles. Specifically, we collaboratively manipulate the modulation style channels and feature maps in control units rather than individual ones to obtain the semantic and spatial disentangled controls. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect the attribute-specific control units. We move the modulation style along a specific sparse direction vector and replace the filter-wise styles used to compute the feature maps to manipulate these control units. We evaluate our proposed method in various face attribute manipulation tasks. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. The manipulation results of real images further show the effectiveness of our method.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475274;;;Systems AND Control
Conjecture: Existence of Nash Equilibria in Modern Internet Congestion Control;;;['Ayush', 'Jingzhi', 'Melodies', 'Sean', 'Raj', 'Ben'];;;June 2021;;;APNet '21: Proceedings of the 5th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking;;;The Internet’s congestion control landscape is currently in the midst of an unprecedented paradigm shift. A recent measurement study found that BBR, a congestion control algorithm introduced by Google in 2016, has seen rapid adoption and is deployed at more than 20% of the Alexa Top 20,000 websites. Encouraging early deployment results from Google, Dropbox and Spotify suggest that BBR could potentially replace traditional loss-based congestion control algorithms like CUBIC. In this paper, we study the interactions between CUBIC and BBR and show that the underlying interactions can be modeled as a normal form game. Our game-theoretic analysis and testbed measurements suggest that while BBR seems to achieve somewhat better performance than CUBIC on the Internet today, this advantage will decrease as the proportion of BBR flows increases. The distribution of congestion control algorithms on the Internet would likely reach a Nash Equilibrium, where no flow has the incentive to switch from CUBIC to BBR, or vice versa. We also found that the distribution of CUBIC and BBR flows in this Nash Equilibrium will be dependent mainly on the size of the bottleneck buffer, and marginally on the RTT distribution of the flows. Our results suggest that the future Internet will likely be more heterogeneous and that buffer sizing will continue to have a significant impact on Internet congestion control.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3469393.3469397;;;Systems AND Control
Intelligent Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning at Single Intersection;;;['Yan Li', 'Junjie He', 'Yayu Gao'];;;April 2021;;;ICCAI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 7th International Conference on Computing and Artificial Intelligence;;;In this paper, we apply the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in intelligent traffic signal control at a single intersection with eight lanes and four signal phases. The optimization goal is to minimize the average waiting time of vehicles so as to improve the traffic efficiency of the intersection. Extensive experiments are conducted in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and compare it with other classic algorithms including Deep Q-network (DQN), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) and Fixed Time. Simulation results show that the proposed PPO algorithm outperforms the others under various traffic scenarios to different extent. The performance gain is significant under unbalanced traffic where one direction is saturated while the other is not, and becomes marginal when all the directions are saturated or unsaturated. PPO also demonstrates good portability and robustness over time-varying traffic patterns, while implies it could be a preferable option for implementation in real world intelligent traffic signal control systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3467707.3467767;;;Systems AND Control

Counterfeiting Congestion Control Algorithms;;;['Margarida Ferreira', 'Akshay Narayan', 'Inês Lynce', 'Ruben Martins', 'Justine Sherry'];;;November 2021;;;HotNets '21: Proceedings of the 20th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks;;;Congestion Control Algorithms (CCAs) impact numerous desirable Internet properties such as performance, stability, and fairness. Hence, the networking community invests substantial effort into studying whether new algorithms are safe for wide-scale deployment. However, operators today are continuously innovating and some deployed CCAs are unpublished - either because the CCA is in beta or because it is considered proprietary. How can the networking community evaluate these new CCAs when their inner workings are unknown? In this paper, we propose 'counterfeit congestion control algorithms' - reverse-engineered implementations derived using program synthesis based on observations of the original implementation. Using the counterfeit (synthesized) CCA implementation, researchers can then evaluate the CCA using controlled empirical testbeds or mathematical analysis, even without access to the original implementation.

A Blockchain-empowered Access Control Framework for Smart Devices in Green Internet of Things;;;['Liang Tan', 'Na Shi', 'Keping Yu', 'Moayad Aloqaily', 'Yaser Jararweh'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Internet Technology;;;Green Internet of things (GIoT) generally refers to a new generation of Internet of things design concept. It can save energy and reduce emissions, reduce environmental pollution, waste of resources, and harm to human body and environment, in which green smart device (GSD) is a basic unit of GIoT for saving energy. With the access of a large number of heterogeneous bottom-layer GSDs in GIoT, user access and control of GSDs have become more and more complicated. Since there is no unified GSD management system, users need to operate different GIoT applications and access different GIoT cloud platforms when accessing and controlling these heterogeneous GSDs. This fragmented GSD management model not only increases the complexity of user access and control for heterogeneous GSDs, but also reduces the scalability of GSDs applications. To address this issue, this article presents a blockchain-empowered general GSD access control framework, which provides users with a unified GSD management platform. First, based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) decentralized identifiers (DIDs) standard, users and GSD are issued visual identity (VID). Then, we extended the GSD-DIDs protocol to authenticate devices and users. Finally, based on the characteristics of decentralization and non-tampering of blockchain, a unified access control system for GSD was designed, including the registration, granting, and revoking of access rights. We implement and test on the Raspberry Pi device and the FISCO-BCOS alliance chain. The experimental results prove that the framework provides a unified and feasible way for users to achieve decentralized, lightweight, and fine-grained access control of GSDs. The solution reduces the complexity of accessing and controlling GSDs, enhances the scalability of GSD applications, as well as guarantees the credibility and immutability of permission data and identity data during access.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3433542;;;Systems AND Control

Our system is based on a mobile application and an IoT control panel of linear actuators. The system provides the user with a simulated elevator panel through the proposed mobile application allowing the user to register external and internal calls to the elevator without physical contact with the controls. Each elevator connected to the system has a unique QR code. The user uses the mobile application which is connected to our server to scan the QR code. Once the desired elevator is identified, the application displays a simulated elevator panel and registers the calls of the user. Registered calls are used to operate IoT control panels attached to the elevator's internal and external panels allowing the user to request an elevator and select the destination floor without having to touch any potentially contaminated button. Alternatively, our IoT control panels can be operated by issuing a voice command to the user's mobile phone specifying the desired direction and floor. We created a database of voice commands to test our voice recognition accuracy with over 25 testing records of users from different age groups, gender, and countries. Our system reported an accuracy ranging between 92 to 100% for the floor levels and 96% and 100% for the open and close commands, respectively. The emergency command was recognized without errors. Our results show that our system can be an effective tool in limiting the COVID-19 cross-infection from interacting with elevator buttons.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485557.3485565;;;Systems AND Control

BDS can be not only used for military purposes, such as intelligence gathering, nuclear explosion monitoring, emergency communications, but also for location services, transportation, mapping, precision agriculture. To ensure the national defense security and the wide application of BDS in civil and military areas, BDS must be autonomous and controllable. As a complex system of knowledge-intensive, knowledge transformation runs through the whole process of research and development, production, operation, and maintenance of BDS.

The autonomous and controllable framework of BDS based on knowledge transformation is constructed from six dimensions of management capability, R&D capability, technical capability, manufacturing capability, service support capability, and application capability. It can provide support for the smooth implementation of information security policy, provide a reference for the autonomy and control of the upstream and downstream industrial chains in Beidou, and provide a reference for the autonomous and controllable research of aerospace components, military measurement equipment, and other related industries.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3501409.3501696;;;Systems AND Control

Then, an MPC controller is derived based on the LPV model. Because the LPV model is polytope, parameter dependent receding-horizon optimization process is introduced and solved with parameter dependent quadratic programming.

DAG amendment for inverse control of parametric shapes;;;['Élie Michel', 'Tamy Boubekeur'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Graphics;;;Parametric shapes model objects as programs producing a geometry based on a few semantic degrees of freedom, called hyper-parameters. These shapes are the typical output of non-destructive modeling, CAD modeling or rigging. However they suffer from the core issue of being manipulated only indirectly, through a series of values rather than the geometry itself. In this paper, we introduce an amendment process of the underlying direct acyclic graph (DAG) of a parametric shape. This amendment enables a local differentiation of the shape w.r.t. its hyper-parameters that we leverage to provide interactive direct manipulation of the output. By acting on the shape synthesis process itself, our method is agnostic to the variations of the connectivity and topology that may occur in its output while changing the input hyper-parameters. Furthermore, our method is oblivious to the internal logic of the DAG nodes. We illustrate our approach on a collection of examples combining the typical nodes found in modern parametric modeling packages - such as deformation, booleans and surfacing operators - for which our method provides the user with inverse control over the hyper-parameters through a brush stroke metaphor.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450626.3459823;;;Systems AND Control
Formal Modelling and Automated Trade-off Analysis of Enforcement Architectures for Cryptographic Access Control in the Cloud;;;['Stefano Berlato', 'Roberto Carbone', 'Adam J. Lee', 'Silvio Ranise'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security;;;To facilitate the adoption of cloud by organizations, Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is the obvious solution to control data sharing among users while preventing partially trusted Cloud Service Providers (CSP) from accessing sensitive data. Indeed, several CAC schemes have been proposed in the literature. Despite their differences, available solutions are based on a common set of entities—e.g., a data storage service or a proxy mediating the access of users to encrypted data—that operate in different (security) domains—e.g., on-premise or the CSP. However, the majority of these CAC schemes assumes a fixed assignment of entities to domains; this has security and usability implications that are not made explicit and can make inappropriate the use of a CAC scheme in certain scenarios with specific trust assumptions and requirements. For instance, assuming that the proxy runs at the premises of the organization avoids the vendor lock-in effect but may give rise to other security concerns (e.g., malicious insiders attackers).To the best of our knowledge, no previous work considers how to select the best possible architecture (i.e., the assignment of entities to domains) to deploy a CAC scheme for the trust assumptions and requirements of a given scenario. In this article, we propose a methodology to assist administrators in exploring different architectures for the enforcement of CAC schemes in a given scenario. We do this by identifying the possible architectures underlying the CAC schemes available in the literature and formalizing them in simple set theory. This allows us to reduce the problem of selecting the most suitable architectures satisfying a heterogeneous set of trust assumptions and requirements arising from the considered scenario to a decidable Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization Problem (MOCOP) for which state-of-the-art solvers can be invoked. Finally, we show how we use the capability of solving the MOCOP to build a prototype tool assisting administrators to preliminarily perform a “What-if” analysis to explore the trade-offs among the various architectures and then use available standards and tools (such as TOSCA and Cloudify) for automated deployment in multiple CSPs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474056;;;Systems AND Control
How to put users in control of their data in federated top-N recommendation with learning to rank;;;['Vito Walter Anelli', 'Yashar Deldjoo', 'Tommaso Di Noia', 'Antonio Ferrara', 'Fedelucio Narducci'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;Recommendation services are extensively adopted in several user-centered applications as a tool to alleviate the information overload problem and help users in orienteering in a vast space of possible choices. In such scenarios, data ownership is a crucial concern since users may not be willing to share their sensitive preferences (e.g., visited locations) with a central server. Unfortunately, data harvesting and collection is at the basis of modern, state-of-the-art approaches to recommendation. To address this issue, we present FPL, an architecture in which users collaborate in training a central factorization model while controlling the amount of sensitive data leaving their devices. The proposed approach implements pair-wise learning-to-rank optimization by following the Federated Learning principles, originally conceived to mitigate the privacy risks of traditional machine learning.

Joint Control of Lane Allocation and Traffic Light for Changeable-Lane Intersection Based on Reinforcement Learning;;;['Emmanuel S. A. Gyarteng', 'Rong Shi', 'Yin Long'];;;December 2021;;;ACAI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 4th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence;;;Deep reinforcement learning based intelligent traffic light is an increasing tendency for improving the traffic condition due to its promising control performance. The current works about intelligent traffic lights tend to control the signal phase or phase time under fixed-lane condition. However, the fixed-lane condition cannot fit the different vehicle flow very well, thus the traffic condition cannot be enhanced further. In this paper, for improving the traffic condition further, we extend the existing intelligent traffic lights to the two-dimension control problem where the agent needs to control not only the traffic light signal, but also the direction of changeable lanes. As a result, the traffic light signal and lane allocation satisfy the need of current vehicle flow simultaneously. Furthermore, for the joint problem of lane allocation and the control of traffic light control, we develop a Q-network structure to build its deep reinforcement learning model. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method outperforms that of the existing intelligent traffic light with fixed lane.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508546.3508619;;;Systems AND Control

Although my country has controlled the epidemic on the whole, there are still local outbreaks. To this end, a classic infectious disease SEIR model was established to study the spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic. The population was divided into four categories: susceptible population, exposed population, infected population and removed population. After the parameters of the SEIR model were determined, Python was applied to conduct drills on the SEIR model, and simulation analysis was conducted on the epidemic transmission in Taiwan and Guangdong provinces with and without control measures. The results show that there are significant differences in the number of exposed, infected, and removed numbers between the two provinces.

Verifying learning-augmented systems;;;['Tomer Eliyahu', 'Yafim Kazak', 'Guy Katz', 'Michael Schapira'];;;August 2021;;;SIGCOMM '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference;;;The application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to computer and networked systems has recently gained significant popularity. However, the obscurity of decisions by DRL policies renders it hard to ascertain that learning-augmented systems are safe to deploy, posing a significant obstacle to their real-world adoption. We observe that specific characteristics of recent applications of DRL to systems contexts give rise to an exciting opportunity: applying formal verification to establish that a given system provably satisfies designer/user-specified requirements, or to expose concrete counter-examples. We present whiRL, a platform for verifying DRL policies for systems, which combines recent advances in the verification of deep neural networks with scalable model checking techniques. To exemplify its usefulness, we employ whiRL to verify natural equirements from recently introduced learning-augmented systems for three real-world environments: Internet congestion control, adaptive video streaming, and job scheduling in compute clusters. Our evaluation shows that whiRL is capable of guaranteeing that natural requirements from these systems are satisfied, and of exposing specific scenarios in which other basic requirements are not.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3452296.3472936;;;Systems AND Control
A High Linearity Process Angle Interference Resistant Multi-phase Output Digital Control Oscillator with Negative Feedback;;;['Changpei Qiu', "Xin'an Wang", 'Xing Zhang', 'Tianxia Zhao', 'Qiuping Li', 'Hu Wang'];;;April 2021;;;RobCE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Robotics and Control Engineering;;;In this paper, we have proposed a high linearity process angle interference resistant multi-phase output digital control oscillator with negative feedback.

An Optimized Algorithm at CTU-level for Rate Control;;;['Zeng Li', 'Ruidong Fang', 'Zhengteng Zhang', 'Yuhan Cai', 'Yapeng Du', 'Jucai Lin', 'Jun Yin'];;;May 2021;;;ICBBT '21: Proceedings of the 2021 13th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Technology;;;CTU-level bit allocation in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard does not fully consider the texture characteristics of related CTUs. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed a CTU-level algorithm for rate control. Firstly, the partition of current CTU is determined by the depth of the spatially co-located CTU in the latest frame. Secondly, the weight of target bitrate for each CTU will be improved according to the ratio of complex and flat blocks in the subCUs, which is obtained by the partition. In addition, considering the texture characteristics of different blocks in current CTU, this paper also adjusts the QP value of each coding unit (CU) according to the bit per pixel (bpp) and SATD per pixel (spp). The experimental results show that compared with the CTU-level rate control algorithm in the test model HM16.20, the error rate of the proposed algorithm in the LDP, LDB, and RA configuration is reduced by 0.72%, 0.74%, and 2.33%, respectively. And the subjective quality of the videos are improved while the volatility of rate is basically unchanged.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473258.3473264;;;Systems AND Control
vBump: Securing Ethernet-based Industrial Control System Networks with VLAN-based Traffic Aggregation;;;['Nils Ole Tippenhauer', 'Binbin Chen', 'Daisuke Mashima', 'David M. Nicol'];;;November 2021;;;CPSIoTSec '21: Proceedings of the 2th Workshop on CPS&amp;IoT Security and Privacy;;;Bump-in-the-wire (bump) devices can be used to protect critical endpoints in Industrial Control System (ICS) networks. However, bump devices cannot be used to authenticate incoming broadcast traffic, are complex to manage, and one bump is needed per host. In this work, we propose a virtual bump-like solution called vBump, which allows to insert virtual bumps in front of Ethernet-based legacy ICS devices. The vBumps can be used to limit traffic to whitelisted destinations, inspect all traffic on or above Link-layer like a centralized intrusion detection systems (or monitoring systems), or even police the traffic like a centralized intrusion prevention systems. In particular, this also allows the network to apply fine-grained control on traffic between nodes that need to be in the same Link-layer broadcast domain. Compared to traditional bumps, vBumps do not require any changes in physical network topology, and the central server's global view allows for more informed decision, with less computational constraints. We implement the system in a high-fidelity ICS testbed, and demonstrate its capabilities to support even time-critical protection control traffic in smart grids. Our system can handle traffic rates of 150Mbps with one-way delay of ~1ms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462633.3483983;;;Systems AND Control
Nonlinear Controller Design for Power System via TS Fuzzy Model;;;['Weiwei Zhang', 'Feng Gao', 'Haofang Liu'];;;November 2021;;;AISS '21: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Advanced Information Science and System;;;With the complexity of network structures and operation conditions, new challenge is brought to power system stability.Conventional linear controllers based on the small signal method were designed via a linearization technique at the equilibrium point,which may not guarantee the stability when the equilibrium point changed or a large disturbance occurred. To overcome this problem, robust controller with the application of nonlinear control theory has been proposed to improve the transient stability. In this paper, a novel approach based on Takagi-Sugeno(T-S) fuzzy model is proposed to design a nonlinear controller for a power system. T-S fuzzy models are constructed as a exact representation of the power system. The controllers for each sub-model is designed based on the concept of parallel distributed compensation(PDC). The controller design problems can be reduced to linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems and can be solved efficiently in practice by convex programming techniques for LMIs.

Due to the precision, vulnerability, and important function of brain tissues, it is essential to ensure the precision and safety of brain tissues surrounding the diseased part. The present study proposes the use of a robot-assisted tele-surgery system to accomplish the process. With the aim to achieve accuracy, an output-bounded and RBF neural network–based bilateral position control method was designed to guarantee the stability and accuracy of the operation process. For the purpose of accomplishing a minimal amount of bleeding and damage, an adaptive force control of the slave manipulator was proposed, allowing it to be appropriate to contact the susceptible vessels, nerves, and brain tissues.

Since there is an inordinateness of objectionable content on the internet, the kids might get exposed to this content typically accidentally whereas sometimes intentionally. Therefore, it becomes vital to observe the web activities of kids by the parents. The lack of parental control, guidance & inability of parents to monitor their kids throughout the whole time frame motivated us to style and develop a parental control and management tool. Initially, we conducted a background study to understand the state-of-the-art tools currently available in the market and compare those tools in terms of functionality, accuracy, efficiency, usability, and security. We also studied the benchmark requirements set by the parents and the freedom of access expressed by the children. We have implemented a front-end solution and an Android App that follows the default criteria set by us. As the internet is a highly dynamic space, we have used a Machine Learning-based approach to classify the website dynamically to provide dynamicity to the tool. The very basic idea is to scrape a website's content once the user enters the URL and then apply an appropriate algorithm to classify the same, essentially converting the problem into a multi-class classification problem. The result indicates that our tool efficiently blocks inappropriate content and facilitates parents with features to control and monitor their children's online activity and help mitigate the risk of cyber threats for children of the current age.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474124.3474196;;;Systems AND Control

RAN-aware Proxy-based Flow Control for High Throughput and Low Delay eMBB;;;['Mamoutou Diarra', 'Walid Dabbous', 'Amine Ismail', 'Thierry Turletti'];;;November 2021;;;MSWiM '21: Proceedings of the 24th International ACM Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems;;;5G enhanced Mobile broadband (eMBB) aims to provide users with a peak data rate of 20 Gbps in the Radio Access Network (RAN). However, since most Congestion Control Algorithms (CCAs) rely on startup and probe phases to discover the bottleneck bandwidth, they cannot quickly utilize the available RAN bandwidth and adapt to fast capacity changes without introducing large delay increase, especially when multiple flows are sharing the same Radio Link Control (RLC) buffer. To tackle this issue, we propose RAPID, a RAN-aware proxy-based flow control mechanism that prevents CCAs from overshooting more than the available RAN capacity while allowing near optimal link utilization. Based on analysis of up-to-date radio information using Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) services and packet arrival rates, RAPID is able to differentiate slow interactive flows from fast download flows and allocate the available bandwidth accordingly. Our experiments with concurrent Cubic and BBR flows show that RAPID can reduce delay increase by a factor of 10 to 50 in both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-LOS (NLOS) conditions while preserving high throughput.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479239.3485717;;;Systems AND Control
Towards Fine-Grained Online Adaptive Approximation Control for Dense SLAM on Embedded GPUs;;;['Tiancong Bu', 'Kaige Yan', 'Jingweijia Tan'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems;;;Dense SLAM is an important application on an embedded environment. However, embedded platforms usually fail to provide enough computation resources for high-accuracy real-time dense SLAM, even with high-parallelism architecture such as GPUs. To tackle this problem, one solution is to design proper approximation techniques for dense SLAM on embedded GPUs. In this work, we propose two novel approximation techniques, critical data identification and redundant branch elimination. We also analyze the error characteristics of the other two techniques—loop skipping and thread approximation. Then, we propose SLaPP, an online adaptive approximation controller, which aims to control the error to be under an acceptable threshold. The evaluation shows SLaPP can achieve 2.0× performance speedup and 30% energy saving on average compared to the case without approximation.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486612;;;Systems AND Control

To overcome these limitations and to meet the challenges of modern networks a new networking paradigm Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been introduced. SDN presents a centralized and completely dynamic environment which provides flexibility and programmability in networks. It enables the network to be controlled centrally and intelligently using multiple software applications. SDN being in its infancy, brings along new challenges. Standardization of various interfaces, scalability, compatibility of contrasting or divergent networks, and vulnerability issues are few of them. This paper discusses various vulnerabilities and possible attacks on every layer of an SDN and focuses on control plane attacks. Further, it presents a comprehensive survey on numerous attacks on the brain of an SDN i.e. the control plane along with existing solutions.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on Two-Step Neighborhood Experience for Traffic Light Control;;;['Yu-Chen Luo', 'Chun-Wei Tsai'];;;December 2021;;;ACM ICEA '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications;;;Several recent studies pointed out that an effective traffic signal/light control strategy will be able to mitigate the traffic congestion problem, and therefore variants of solutions have been presented for solving this optimization problem. The multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is one of the promising methods because it can provide good traffic control strategies for such complex environments. However, because each agent on its intersection of most MARL-based algorithms has only partial information from the observations of its intersection, the traffic control plan based on such incomplete information of all agents may not always be useful for improving traffic of an entire city. To enhance the performance of the MARL in solving the traffic light control problem, we present an effective algorithm based on an effective communication protocol to share the information between agents of neighbor intersections to make an integrated traffic light control plan. Moreover, a two-step decision mechanism is presented in this study to further improve the performance of MARL for traffic light control. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compared it with several message-passing-based algorithms on the simulator of Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) in this study. The results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding better results than all the other message-passing-based algorithms compared in this study for traffic light control problems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491396.3506544;;;Systems AND Control

This work considers a collection of Npop heterogeneous agents that can be segregated into K classes such that the k-th class contains Nk homogeneous agents. We aim to prove approximation guarantees of the MARL problem for this heterogeneous system by its corresponding MFC problem. We consider three scenarios where the reward and transition dynamics of all agents are respectively taken to be functions of (1) joint state and action distributions across all classes, (2) individual distributions of each class, and (3) marginal distributions of the entire population. We show that, in these cases, the K-class MARL problem can be approximated by MFC with errors given as $e_1=\mathcal{O}(\frac{\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|}+\sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}}{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}\sum_{k}\sqrt{N_k})$, $e_2=\mathcal{O}(\left[\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|}+\sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}\right]\sum_{k}\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_k}})$ and $e_3=\mathcal{O}\left(\left[\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|}+\sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}\right]\left[\frac{A}{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}\sum_{k\in[K]}\sqrt{N_k}+\frac{B}{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{pop}}}}\right]\right)$, respectively, where A, B are some constants and |χ|, |U| are the sizes of state and action spaces of each agent. Finally, we design a Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) based algorithm that, in the three cases stated above, can converge to an optimal MARL policy within O(ej) error with a sample complexity of O(ej-3), j ∈ {1, 2, 3}, respectively.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586718;;;Systems AND Control

Adaptive Management of Volatile Edge Systems at Runtime With Satisfiability;;;['Cosmin Avasalcai', 'Christos Tsigkanos', 'Schahram Dustdar'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Internet Technology;;;Edge computing offers the possibility of deploying applications at the edge of the network. To take advantage of available devices’ distributed resources, applications often are structured as microservices, often having stringent requirements of low latency and high availability. However, a decentralized edge system that the application may be intended for is characterized by high volatility, due to devices making up the system being unreliable or leaving the network unexpectedly. This makes application deployment and assurance that it will continue to operate under volatility challenging. We propose an adaptive framework capable of deploying and efficiently maintaining a microservice-based application at runtime, by tackling two intertwined problems: (i) finding a microservice placement across device hosts and (ii) deriving invocation paths that serve it. Our objective is to maintain correct functionality by satisfying given requirements in terms of end-to-end latency and availability, in a volatile edge environment.

Multi-Objective Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Infectious Disease Control;;;['Runzhe Wan', 'Xinyu Zhang', 'Rui Song'];;;August 2021;;;KDD '21: Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining;;;Severe infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pose a huge threat to public health. Stringent control measures, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, while having significant effects, also bring huge economic losses.

Specifically, at each decision point, a Bayesian epidemiological model is first learned as the environment model, and then the proposed model-based multi-objective planning algorithm is applied to find a set of Pareto-optimal policies.

Strategy synthesis for partially-known switched stochastic systems;;;['John Jackson', 'Luca Laurenti', 'Eric Frew', 'Morteza Lahijanian'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;We present a data-driven framework for strategy synthesis for partially-known switched stochastic systems. The properties of the system are specified using linear temporal logic (LTL) over finite traces (LTLf), which is as expressive as LTL and enables interpretations over finite behaviors. The framework first learns the unknown dynamics via Gaussian process regression. Then, it builds a formal abstraction of the switched system in terms of an uncertain Markov model, namely an Interval Markov Decision Process (IMDP), by accounting for both the stochastic behavior of the system and the uncertainty in the learning step. Then, we synthesize a strategy on the resulting IMDP that maximizes the satisfaction probability of the LTLf specification and is robust against all the uncertainties in the abstraction. This strategy is then refined into a switching strategy for the original stochastic system. We show that this strategy is near-optimal and provide a bound on its distance (error) to the optimal strategy. We experimentally validate our framework on various case studies, including both linear and non-linear switched stochastic systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456649;;;Systems AND Control

Camera keyframing with style and control;;;['Hongda Jiang', 'Marc Christie', 'Xi Wang', 'Libin Liu', 'Bin Wang', 'Baoquan Chen'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Graphics;;;We present a novel technique that enables 3D artists to synthesize camera motions in virtual environments following a camera style, while enforcing user-designed camera keyframes as constraints along the sequence. To solve this constrained motion in-betweening problem, we design and train a camera motion generator from a collection of temporal cinematic features (camera and actor motions) using a conditioning on target keyframes. We further condition the generator with a style code to control how to perform the interpolation between the keyframes. Style codes are generated by training a second network that encodes different camera behaviors in a compact latent space, the camera style space. Camera behaviors are defined as temporal correlations between actor features and camera motions and can be extracted from real or synthetic film clips. We further extend the system by incorporating a fine control of camera speed and direction via a hidden state mapping technique. We evaluate our method on two aspects: i) the capacity to synthesize style-aware camera trajectories with user defined keyframes; and ii) the capacity to ensure that in-between motions still comply with the reference camera style while satisfying the keyframe constraints. As a result, our system is the first style-aware keyframe in-betweening technique for camera control that balances style-driven automation with precise and interactive control of keyframes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478513.3480533;;;Systems AND Control
The Illusion of Control in Privacy Trade-Offs: Does Familiarity Play a Role?;;;['Ivana de Boer', 'Eelco Herder', 'Marc van Lieshoud'];;;June 2021;;;UMAP '21: Adjunct Proceedings of the 29th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization;;;Contemporary legislative and scientific trends stress the importance of control as an instrument to manage informational privacy. Still, privacy decision-making remains far from optimal as there is a discrepancy between privacy attitudes and privacy behaviours. To interpret this gap, this study builds upon the systematic biases found in behavioural economics theory, more specifically the illusion of control. This study examines the effects of the illusion of control through stimulus familiarity on privacy behaviour. More specifically, we compared the participants’ willingness to provide personal data between a very familiar web store and a web store unknown to them. The results from a sample of 171 students in the Netherlands indicate that, even though the level of perceived control and the amount of data disclosure are higher in the familiar condition, stimulus familiarity does not induce an illusion of control in privacy trade-offs. Moreover, this relationship is slightly weaker for sensitive disclosure. However, this study did find evidence of gender differences in sensitive disclosure: in this sample, women disclosed significantly less sensitive information than men, possibly due to risk-aversion.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450614.3464471;;;Systems AND Control

Dynamic User-Centric Clustered Workplaces for COVID-19 Control Measures Based on Geofencing and Deep Learning;;;['Ahmed Mostafa Abdelkhalek', 'Noor El-Deen Magdy Mohamed', 'Mostafa Mahmoud Abdelhakam', 'Mahmoud Mohamed Elmesalawy'];;;March 2022;;;ICMLT '22: Proceedings of the 2022 7th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies;;;Control measures have been applied in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Different technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and geofencing are required to be exploited for developing efficient techniques to deal with this crisis. Workplaces are the most dangerous areas that can lead to the infection of the pandemic. This is due to the increased density of people and transactions in limited places. In this paper, an efficient approach is proposed to monitor and impose COVID-19 control measures in workplaces. The workplace environment is clustered based on a dynamic user-centric clustering scheme, where each person in the workplace is assigned to a set of associated geofences that form its cluster. For each geofence, different wireless and network metrics are used for generating its digital signature. An efficient technique based on deep learning is proposed to generate the geofence digital signature and detect whether the person is inside his associated cluster or not. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique for different locations in a real workplace. Specifically, an accuracy of 92.86% is achieved in a workplace environment by the proposed approach.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3529399.3529435;;;Systems AND Control
A DNN-based Real-time Speech Recognition Control Game;;;['Yahao Wu', 'Jingzhi Ruan'];;;September 2021;;;ICIST '21: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Science and Technology;;;A real-time speech recognition game based on DNN was designed in this paper. English numbers 1 and 2 from the English database were firstly extracted for training through DNN, and K-folds and committee votes were used to optimize the system to obtain a mature training model for distinguishing speech input. Speech recording function belonging to Python was used to realize real-time speech recording. The 8000 feature elements in the obtained speech were converted into 784 feature elements through STFT, and then the obtained training model is introduced for speech prediction. In this paper, a game based on binary control was designed, which used speech commands to control the movement of game objects to avoid obstacles, and to reflect the recognition accuracy through scoring. The real-time control of the game by speech was by designing a list and a multi-threaded control system.

Tracking Large Class Projects in Real-Time Using Fine-Grained Source Control;;;['Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera', 'Jeff Turkstra', 'Jordan Buckmaster', 'Killian LeClainche', 'Shawn Montgomery', 'William Reed', 'Ryan Sullivan', 'Jarett Lee'];;;February 2022;;;SIGCSE 2022: Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education - Volume 1;;;Managing a class and identifying common problems becomes significantly more challenging as class sizes increase. Additionally, the increase of online learning requires better methods to track student progress remotely. In this paper, we describe a system that tracks student progress in real time. We propose a method for obtaining a fine-grained commit history by creating a Git repository for each student and automatically running commit/push commands every time a student compiles code. This approach makes a rich source of trace data that can track student progress in real-time, identify common problems students are having, alert faculty of students that are falling behind, and verify project authorship. However, analyzing individual repositories in a large class of students can be tedious and complex, so we have developed a system that provides quick access to all student repositories and summary information and statistics for their projects. This paper describes our approach for obtaining fine-grained source control commits in real-time, a method for tracking student and overall class progress using this data, and our experiences using this system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478431.3499389;;;Systems AND Control
PFPN: Continuous Control of Physically Simulated Characters using Particle Filtering Policy Network;;;['Pei Xu', 'Ioannis Karamouzas'];;;November 2021;;;MIG '21: Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGGRAPH Conference on Motion, Interaction and Games;;;Data-driven methods for physics-based character control using reinforcement learning have been successfully applied to generate high-quality motions. However, existing approaches typically rely on Gaussian distributions to represent the action policy, which can prematurely commit to suboptimal actions when solving high-dimensional continuous control problems for highly-articulated characters. In this paper, to improve the learning performance of physics-based character controllers, we propose a framework that considers a particle-based action policy as a substitute for Gaussian policies. We exploit particle filtering to dynamically explore and discretize the action space, and track the posterior policy represented as a mixture distribution. The resulting policy can replace the unimodal Gaussian policy which has been the staple for character control problems, without changing the underlying model architecture of the reinforcement learning algorithm used to perform policy optimization. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on various motion capture imitation tasks. Baselines using our particle-based policies achieve better imitation performance and speed of convergence as compared to corresponding implementations using Gaussians, and are more robust to external perturbations during character control.

Nozzle-to-Work Distance Measurement and Control in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing;;;['Raven Thomas Reisch', 'Tobias Hauser', 'Jan Franke', 'Florian Heinrich', 'Konstantinos Theodorou', 'Tobias Kamps', 'Alois Knoll'];;;November 2021;;;ESSE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 European Symposium on Software Engineering;;;In multi-axes Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing, keeping the correct nozzle-to-work distance is crucial to avoid collisions and process defects. Measuring this distance is challenging as the welding arc complicates the usage of conventional distance measurements without positional offset in-process. For that reason, this study investigated and evaluated the usage of several sensors (wire feed sensor, current and voltage sensor, microphone, welding camera, spectrometer, structural acoustic sensor) for a direction independent in-process measurement. Features were extracted based on domain knowledge and selected by means of a correlation analysis. The spectrometer (Pearson’s r = −0.90) showed the most robust measurements for stable process parameters when computing the relative intensity at a wavelength of 960 nm, followed by the welding camera (Pearson’s r = 0.84) when analyzing the images with a convolutional neural network. Based on the findings, a closed-loop-control was created. As a system identification revealed a high impact of the welding speed on the track height in comparison to the wire feed rate (Pearson’s r − 0.90 < > − 0.16), the closed-loop-control was realized by means of a simple P-control for the welding speed. The proposed approach enabled the manufacturing of multi-layer multi-bead parts with multi-axes deposition paths.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3501774.3501798;;;Systems AND Control
Control strategies for physically simulated characters performing two-player competitive sports;;;['Jungdam Won', 'Deepak Gopinath', 'Jessica Hodgins'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Graphics;;;In two-player competitive sports, such as boxing and fencing, athletes often demonstrate efficient and tactical movements during a competition. In this paper, we develop a learning framework that generates control policies for physically simulated athletes who have many degrees-of-freedom. Our framework uses a two step-approach, learning basic skills and learning bout-level strategies, with deep reinforcement learning, which is inspired by the way that people how to learn competitive sports. We develop a policy model based on an encoder-decoder structure that incorporates an autoregressive latent variable, and a mixture-of-experts decoder. To show the effectiveness of our framework, we implemented two competitive sports, boxing and fencing, and demonstrate control policies learned by our framework that can generate both tactical and natural-looking behaviors. We also evaluate the control policies with comparisons to other learning configurations and with ablation studies.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450626.3459761;;;Systems AND Control
Adaptive parameter tuning for reachability analysis of nonlinear systems;;;['Mark Wetzlinger', 'Adrian Kulmburg', 'Matthias Althoff'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;Reachability analysis fails to produce tight reachable sets if certain algorithm parameters are poorly tuned, such as the time step size or the accuracy of the set representation. The tuning is especially difficult in the context of nonlinear systems where over-approximation errors accumulate over time due to the so-called wrapping effect, often requiring expert knowledge. In order to widen the applicability of reachability analysis for practitioners, we propose the first adaptive parameter tuning approach for reachability analysis of nonlinear continuous systems tuning all algorithm parameters. Our modular approach can be applied to different reachability algorithms as well as various set representations. Finally, an evaluation on numerous benchmark systems shows that the adaptive parameter tuning approach efficiently computes very tight enclosures of reachable sets.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456643;;;Systems AND Control

Through a thematic analysis of interviews with five households, we consider Foucault’s theory on disciplinary power to examine how smart home technologies shape the experience of the home by shifting the flow of information and thereby reify power structures. Results indicate that the implementation of smart technology can affect access to shared spaces, constrain interactions, and predefine practices thereby establishing hierarchies within the household. We turn the discussion towards ethical challenges concerning control, whose problems the smart home is concerned with, and how the smart home embeds itself in the household.

Moisture Control using Linear Regression for Automatic Seed Germination Box on Rockwool;;;['Hurriyatul Fitriyah', 'Hermawan Nugroho', 'Edita Rosana Widasari', 'Heroniu Hahmanda', 'Lindhu Kusuma', 'Muhammad Chairurrafi'];;;September 2021;;;SIET '21: Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Sustainable Information Engineering and Technology;;;In hydroponics, seed germination plays an important role as the yield and quality of the crops heavily depends on this stage. Moisture is the most crucial parameter to be maintained during germination. The medium of seed germination should be watered frequently to keep its moisture. This process is usually carried manually by the growers. Hence, an automation watering process will be beneficial. This research develops an Automatic Seed Germination Box that controls the moisture of the Rockwool medium to a certain level. A Linear Regression is developed and applied to control the motor driver based on the reading of the Moisture sensor to achieve a certain moisture level. The system consists of a Moisture sensor, an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a motor driver, and a mini water pump. The motor driver turns the mini water pump on and off to pump-up the water into the Automatic Seed Germination Box. Experiment shows that the difference between actual duration and the predicted duration in controlling the motor driver has a low error with MAPE of 8.55% and RMSE of 0.4 seconds. The system is also used to grow the seeds. The growth test shows that the developed system can grow the seeds to become the seedlings well.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479645.3479707;;;Systems AND Control

Of which, the voluntary delisting rate is much higher than that of the other stock exchanges in the world. Employing a data set of firms listed on NEEQ during the period in 2013-2019, this paper analyzes the determinants of voluntary delisting in NEEQ market. Results show that the insufficient stock liquidity and decentralized control right are the main reasons for voluntary delisting. Further study shows that a tiered system restrains voluntary delisting, and a good business environment reduces the possibility of voluntary delisting. Our findings suggest that the improving stock liquidity in NEEQ market is a key mean to reduce voluntary delisting. For the firms which plan to list on the NEEQ, they should trade-off the benefits and costs of listing before making the listing decision.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3481127.3481209;;;Systems AND Control
A GAN-Like Approach for Physics-Based Imitation Learning and Interactive Character Control;;;['Pei Xu', 'Ioannis Karamouzas'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques;;;We present a simple and intuitive approach for interactive control of physically simulated characters. Our work builds upon generative adversarial networks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning framework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained in tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to discriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation policy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our GAN-like approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately to imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external control signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different policies. Compared to existing method, our proposed approach has the following attractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance without manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly controls the character without having to track any target reference pose explicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive policy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching mechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of imitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability to withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our approach has low runtime cost and can be easily integrated into interactive applications and games.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3480148;;;Systems AND Control

Previous classic CCAs are designed for a specific domain with fixed rules, failing to adapt to such diversities. Recently surged learning-based CCAs have great potential in adaptability and flexibility but are not practical due to unsatisfying performance on convergence, fairness, overhead and safety assurance. In this paper, we propose Libra, a unified congestion control framework, which empowers flexibility, adaptability, and practicality, by combining the wisdom of classic and reinforcement learning (RL)-based CCAs. Extensive evaluation of Libra's Linux kernel implementations on both live Internet and emulated networks shows performance improvement under dynamic networks (e.g., 1.2x throughput than Orca on average). At the same time, Libra can flexibly satisfy different application needs, reduce the running overhead by at most 0.92x and perform good fairness and convergence properties, well-fitting our theoretical analysis.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485983.3494840;;;Systems AND Control

While AM is increasingly becoming integral to many industries, including aerospace, automotive, and biomedical, it has opened a host of unique security concerns, from theft of technical data to process sabotage and counterfeiting. In this work, we present a method to address the counterfeiting problem by embedding information in additively manufactured parts through controlling printing process parameters. Variations in printing speed, the encoding parameter in this work, introduce subtle localized height differences on parts' surfaces, which are readable using an optical profilometer. The profilometry data is captured after printing, and this data is processed to predict the intended bit response for each embedding region on the surface of the part. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme for embedding and reading the information in 3D printed parts and show that it achieves 80% accuracy for a 53 mm/s difference in printing speed between the encoded bits. Finally, we characterize the performance of the proposed scheme, measured as the accuracy in decoded messages, as a function of the difference in printing speed used to perform the embedding.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462223.3485623;;;Systems AND Control

In this work, a novel ILLRW is proposed, equipped with a walking remote system via control lever and driver units to assist user's walk correspondingly. However, the walking ability varied significantly from stroke persons, and a system that can interfere with the driving system to adjust the speed according to the pace is critical.

Leveraging Automatic High-Level Synthesis Resource Sharing to Maximize Dynamical Voltage Overscaling with Error Control;;;['Prattay Chowdhury', 'Benjamin Carrion Schafer'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems;;;Approximate Computing has emerged as an alternative way to further reduce the power consumption of integrated circuits (ICs) by trading off errors at the output with simpler, more efficient logic. So far the main approaches in approximate computing have been to simplify the hardware circuit by pruning the circuit until the maximum error threshold is met. One of the critical issues, though, is the training data used to prune the circuit. The output error can significantly exceed the maximum error if the final workload does not match the training data. Thus, most previous work typically assumes that training data matches with the workload data distribution. In this work, we present a method that dynamically overscales the supply voltage based on different workload distribution at runtime. This allows to adaptively select the supply voltage that leads to the largest power savings while ensuring that the error will never exceed the maximum error threshold. This approach also allows restoring of the original error-free circuit if no matching workload distribution is found. The proposed method also leverages the ability of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to automatically generate circuits with different properties by setting different synthesis constraints to maximize the available timing slack and, hence, maximize the power savings. Experimental results show that our proposed method works very well, saving on average 47.08% of power as compared to the exact output circuit and 20.25% more than a traditional approximation method.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3473909;;;Systems AND Control

Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to issue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in classical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be exploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum scenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline stall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU requires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of quantum errors.  In this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit Circuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP). Firstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which supports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can handle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that disrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar approach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum instructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU deterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a six-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59 × speedup compared with a single core.

A program logic to verify signal temporal logic specifications of hybrid systems;;;['Hammad Ahmad', 'Jean-Baptiste Jeannin'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;Signal temporal logic (STL) was introduced for monitoring temporal properties of continuous-time signals for continuous and hybrid systems. Differential dynamic logic (dL) was introduced to reason about the end states of a hybrid program. Over the past decade, STL and its variants have significantly gained in popularity in the industry for monitoring purposes, while dL has gained in popularity for verification of hybrid systems. In this paper, we bridge the gap between the two different logics by introducing signal temporal dynamic logic (STdL) - a dynamic logic that reasons about a subset of STL specifications over executions of hybrid systems. Our work demonstrates that STL can be used for deductive verification of hybrid systems. STdL significantly augments the expressiveness of dL by allowing reasoning about temporal properties in given time intervals. We provide a semantics and a proof calculus for STdL, along with a proof of soundness and relative completeness.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456648;;;Systems AND Control
A Digital Twin Architecture for Wireless Networked Adaptive Active Noise Control;;;['Chuang Shi', 'Feiyu Du', 'Qianyang Wu'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing;;;The active noise control (ANC) is a complementary technique to the passive noise control (PNC) to reduce the low frequency noise. The ANC controller can be implemented by pre-trained filters or adaptive filters. The adaptive ANC controller is advantageous in its adaptation to environmental changes. However, the algorithm complexity of the adaptive ANC controller increases with the scale of ANC applications, making it difficult to be carried out on low-cost processors. To resolve this problem, cloud computing should be utilized in ANC systems, and thus the wireless networked ANC system is proposed. Since it is crucial for ANC controllers to generate the anti-noise wave in real time, this paper formulates a digital twin architecture that implements the control filter adaptation in the cloud and the anti-noise signal generation on the local controller, respectively. A digital twin filtered-reference least mean squares (DT-FxLMS) algorithm is proposed to coordinate the digital twin with the local controller. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the wireless networked ANC system based on the digital twin architecture.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TASLP.2022.3199992;;;Systems AND Control

Intelligent Traffic Signal Control Based on Reinforcement Learning with State Reduction for Smart Cities;;;['Li Kuang', 'Jianbo Zheng', 'Kemu Li', 'Honghao Gao'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Internet Technology;;;Efficient signal control at isolated intersections is vital for relieving congestion, accidents, and environmental pollution caused by increasing numbers of vehicles. However, most of the existing studies not only ignore the constraint of the limited computing resources available at isolated intersections but also the matching degree between the signal timing and the traffic demand, leading to high complexity and reduced learning efficiency. In this article, we propose a traffic signal control method based on reinforcement learning with state reduction. First, a reinforcement learning model is established based on historical traffic flow data, and we propose a dual-objective reward function that can reduce vehicle delay and improve the matching degree between signal time allocation and traffic demand, allowing the agent to learn the optimal signal timing strategy quickly. Second, the state and action spaces of the model are preliminarily reduced by selecting a proper control phase combination; then, the state space is further reduced by eliminating rare or nonexistent states based on the historical traffic flow. Finally, a simplified Q-table is generated and used to optimize the complexity of the control algorithm. The results of simulation experiments show that our proposed control algorithm effectively improves the capacity of isolated intersections while reducing the time and space costs of the signal control algorithm.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3418682;;;Systems AND Control
PinpointFly: An Egocentric Position-control Drone Interface using Mobile AR;;;['Linfeng Chen', 'Kazuki Takashima', 'Kazuyuki Fujita', 'Yoshifumi Kitamura'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;Accurate drone positioning is challenging because pilots only have a limited position and direction perception of a flying drone from their perspective. This makes conventional joystick-based speed control inaccurate and more complicated and significantly degrades piloting performance. We propose PinpointFly, an egocentric drone interface that allows pilots to arbitrarily position and rotate a drone using position-control direct interactions on a see-through mobile AR where the drone position and direction are visualized with a virtual cast shadow (i.e., the drone’s orthogonal projection onto the floor). Pilots can point to the next position or draw the drone’s flight trajectory by manipulating the virtual cast shadow and the direction/height slider bar on the touchscreen. We design and implement a prototype of PinpointFly for indoor and visual line of sight scenarios, which are comprised of real-time and predefined motion-control techniques. We conduct two user studies with simple positioning and inspection tasks. Our results demonstrate that PinpointFly makes the drone positioning and inspection operations faster, more accurate, simpler and fewer workload than a conventional joystick interface with a speed-control method.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445110;;;Systems AND Control
Using grammatical evolution for modelling energy consumption on a computer numerical control machine;;;['Samuel Carvalho', 'Joe Sullivan', 'Douglas Mota Dias', 'Enrique Naredo', 'Conor Ryan'];;;July 2021;;;GECCO '21: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion;;;Discrete manufacturing is known to be a high consumer of energy and much work has been done in continuous improvement and energy saving methods addressing this issue. Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, commonly used in the manufacturing of metal parts, are highly energy-demanding because of many required sub-systems, such as cooling, lubrication, logical interfaces and electric motors. For this reason, there is a large body of work focusing on modelling the energy needs of this class of machine. This paper applies Grammatical Evolution (GE) for developing auto-regressive models for the energy consumption of a CNC machine. Empirical data from three 24-hour work shifts comprising three different types of products are used as inputs. We also introduce an autocorrelation-informed approach for the grammar, which benefits from a prior analysis of the training data for better capturing periodic or close to periodic behaviour. Finally, we compare the outcomes from real and predicted energy profiles through the use of an existing analysis tool, which is capable of extracting production-related information such as total and average KW consumption, number of parts produced and breakdown of production and idle hours. Results show that GE yields accurate and explainable models for the analysed scenario.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449726.3463185;;;Systems AND Control

Lack of communication negatively impacts the performance of industrial automation systems, e.g. Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) fleets. Utilizing industrial Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) and adaptive positioning systems can reduce the number of disconnections in these AGV fleets. Therefore the performance of the mobile systems (e.g. AGV fleet) is improved and factory efficiency increased. In this work procedural simulation is used to examine wireless communication in industrial applications. This methods enables the observation of the interaction of mobility control system, network status and robotic system performance independently from a specific environment or scenario.

Optimising Boolean Synthetic Regulatory Networks to Control Cell States;;;['Nadia Taou', 'Michael Lones'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics;;;Controlling the dynamics of gene regulatory networks is a challenging problem. In recent years, a number of control methods have been proposed, but most of these approaches do not address the problem of how they could be implemented in practice. In this paper, we consider the idea of using a synthetic regulatory network as a closed-loop controller that can control and respond to the dynamics of a cell&#x2019;s native regulatory network <italic>in situ</italic>. We explore this idea using a computational model in which both native and synthetic regulatory networks are represented by Boolean networks. We then use an evolutionary algorithm to optimise both the structure and parameters of the synthetic Boolean network. To test this approach, we look at whether controllers can be optimised to target specific steady states in five different Boolean regulatory circuit models. Our results show that in most cases the controllers are able to drive the dynamics of the target system to a specified steady state, often using few interventions, and further experiments using random Boolean networks show that the approach scales well to larger controlled networks.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TCBB.2020.2973636;;;Systems AND Control

In this paper we present Aion, a configurable security architecture that provides a notion of guaranteed real-time execution for dynamically loaded enclaves. We implement preemptive multitasking and restricted atomicity on top of strong enclave software isolation and attestation. Our approach allows the hardware to enforce confidentiality and integrity protections, while a decoupled small enclaved scheduler software component can enforce availability and guarantee strict deadlines of a bounded number of protected applications, without necessarily introducing a notion of priorities amongst these applications. We implement a prototype on a light-weight TEE processor and provide a case study.

Reinforcement Learning for Datacenter Congestion Control;;;['Chen Tessler', 'Yuval Shpigelman', 'Gal Dalal', 'Amit Mandelbaum', 'Doron Haritan Kazakov', 'Benjamin Fuhrer', 'Gal Chechik', 'Shie Mannor'];;;September 2021;;;ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review;;;We approach the task of network congestion control in datacenters using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Successful congestion control algorithms can dramatically improve latency and overall network throughput. Until today, no such learning-based algorithms have shown practical potential in this domain. Evidently, the most popular recent deployments rely on rule-based heuristics that are tested on a predetermined set of benchmarks. Consequently, these heuristics do not generalize well to newly-seen scenarios. Contrarily, we devise an RL-based algorithm with the aim of generalizing to different configurations of real-world datacenter networks. We overcome challenges such as partial-observability, nonstationarity, and multi-objectiveness. We further propose a policy gradient algorithm that leverages the analytical structure of the reward function to approximate its derivative and improve stability. We show that this scheme outperforms alternative popular RL approaches, and generalizes to scenarios that were not seen during training. Our experiments, conducted on a realistic simulator that emulates communication networks' behavior, exhibit improved performance concurrently on the multiple considered metrics compared to the popular algorithms deployed today in real datacenters. Our algorithm is being productized to replace heuristics in some of the largest datacenters in the world.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512798.3512815;;;Systems AND Control
Adaptive Traffic Light Dynamic Control Based on Road Traffic Signal from Google Maps;;;['Ahmed Jaber Abougarair', 'Mohamed M. Edardar'];;;October 2021;;;ICEMIS'21: The 7th International Conference on Engineering &amp; MIS 2021;;;One of the major and recurring issues we confront in today's urbanized world is traffic congestion, which is caused by an increase in the use of private automobiles, and whereas vehicle volume density fluctuates on temporally short and geographically small scales, efficient traffic signal control aids in avoiding traffic bottlenecks. Where this huge problem has piqued the interest of the research and development community, resulting in the creation of a number of Intelligent Traffic Management systems (ITS) where a traffic management technique in which traffic signal timing adjusts, or adapts, based on real traffic demand is known as an adaptive traffic control system (ATCS). Systems for regulating cycle time in real-time may now be produced thanks to embedded system development with growing standards of computing technology, compact electronics boards, software packages, and closed-loop control systems. Most of Libya's traffic control systems are currently devoid of intelligence and operate as an open-loop control system with no feedback or sensing. As a result, there is a need to simulate and improve traffic management systems. The goal of this paper is to improve the traffic control system in to offer intelligent feedback to the current network's congestion state as it adapts to changing traffic density patterns. The method outlined in this paper uses algorithm-based Python code, Driving Scenarios Designer, Video Reader (MATLAB®), and Google Map crowdsource data to control and detect real-time traffic congestion at traffic lights, without the cost of sensor equipment. This algorithm is used to categorize the status of congestion for a particular intersection, by triggering and delivering data to the timer control system, this technique manipulates and optimizes signal timing. By detecting traffic density and dynamically changing the waiting duration of traffic signals, this suggested system is anticipated to eliminate or decrease these needless traffic bottlenecks. Furthermore, the ease with which this technology might be applied to existing traffic signal systems was emphasized.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492547.3492584;;;Systems AND Control
Indistinguishability Prevents Scheduler Side Channels in Real-Time Systems;;;['Chien-Ying Chen', 'Debopam Sanyal', 'Sibin Mohan'];;;November 2021;;;CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;Scheduler side-channels can leak critical information in real-time systems, thus posing serious threats to many safety-critical applications. The main culprit is the inherent determinism in the runtime timing behavior of such systems, e.g., the (expected) periodic behavior of critical tasks. In this paper, we introduce the notion of "schedule indistinguishability/", inspired by work in differential privacy, that introduces diversity into the schedules of such systems while offering analyzable security guarantees. We achieve this by adding a sufficiently large (controlled) noise to the task schedules in order to break their deterministic execution patterns. An "epsilon-Scheduler" then implements schedule indistinguishability in real-time Linux. We evaluate our system using two real applications: (a) an autonomous rover running on a real hardware platform (Raspberry Pi) and (b) a video streaming application that sends data across large geographic distances. Our results show that the epsilon-Scheduler offers better protection against scheduler side-channel attacks in real-time systems while still maintaining good performance and quality-of-service(QoS) requirements.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484769;;;Systems AND Control

The qualitative findings reveal tensions between wanting autonomy and control and the necessity of opportunities and convenience. Freelancing platforms are perceived as systems that present advantages to find clients, gain experience and mitigate precarity.

A lot of inverter-design requirements such as overload protection, short circuit and over-charge protection circuits, among others, have been proposed for performance optimization. However, all these circuits do not solve the problem of power management of the inverter system, which makes it impossible to maximize the achievable operation time at a single full-charge cycle. Hence, this paper presents a 3.5 kVA, 24V, 50Hz power smart inverter system. The inverter has four different AC output terminals for effective online power management. An internet of things (IoT) module has been embedded into the inverter system and used for basic operations such as inverter data collection, data upload to internet server, command download from server, control of inverter's power switch and AC output terminals. A web-based GUI was designed for effective system status monitoring and user discretional control. The design was tested for optimal utilization of energy and it gave a robust output.

Human Control and Discretion in AI-driven Decision-making in Government;;;['Lilian Mitrou', 'Marijn Janssen', 'Euripidis Loukis'];;;October 2021;;;ICEGOV '21: Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance;;;Traditionally public decision-makers have been given discretion in many of the decisions they have to make in how to comply with legislation and policies. In this way, the context and specific circumstances can be taken into account when making decisions. This enables more acceptable solutions, but at the same time, discretion might result in treating individuals differently. With the advance of AI-based decisions, the role of the decision-makers is changing. The automation might result in fully automated decisions, humans-in-the-loop or AI might only be used as recommender systems in which humans have the discretion to deviate from the suggested decision. The predictability of and the accountability of the decisions might vary in these circumstances, although humans always remain accountable. Hence, there is a need for human-control and the decision-makers should be given sufficient authority to control the system and deal with undesired outcomes. In this direction this paper analyzes the degree of discretion and human control needed in AI-driven decision-making in government.

Undetected anomalies may lead to process failure, cause financial damage and have significant impact on human lives. Thus, it is important to detect anomalies at early stages and to protect data in Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we propose the novel on-the-fly NIST-compliant key generation scheme for a secure data container used to transfer and store sensor data. The data container delivers data from the low-level field sensors to high-level data analysis servers in a protected form. It provides data confidentiality and integrity, as well as data origin integrity, a fine-grained role-based and attribute-based access control. As a result, the anomaly detector runs on trustworthy data sets, protected from unauthorized adversarial modifications. Our solution can be easily integrated with many existing Cyber-Physical Systems and IT infrastructures since our secure data container supports RESTful API and is implemented in two modifications: (1) signed, watermarked and encrypted spreadsheet file; (2) signed and encrypted JSON file. In addition, we implemented several machine learning models based on a Random Forest, a k-Nearest Neighbors, a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network algorithms for the detection of various anomalies and attacks in a gas pipeline system.

The results show that crosstalk is inversely proportional to the distance between lines and is directly proportional to the height from the ground and the coupling length, and the amplitude of variation increases significantly when the frequency is greater than 80MHz. For shielding layer, double-end grounding has the strongest anti interference ability. Single-end grounding has a significant inhibitory effect on low frequency interference, but has limited suppression of high-frequency interference. Double-end floating has a worse anti interference effect.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487075.3487180;;;Systems AND Control
A Semantic Framework for Direct Information Flows in Hybrid-Dynamic Systems;;;['Sepehr Amir-Mohammadian'];;;May 2021;;;CPSS '21: Proceedings of the 7th ACM on Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop;;;Hybrid-dynamic models provide an underlying framework to study the evergrowing cyber-physical systems with an emphasis on the integration of their discrete computational steps and the associated continuous physical dynamics. Ubiquity of cyber-physical systems necessitates some level of assurance about the secure flow of information through different discrete and continuous components. In recent years, different logical frameworks have been proposed to analyze indirect information flows in cyber-physical systems. While these frameworks are used to verify secure flow of information in a metalevel, they naturally fall short in support of implementing information flow analyzers that could effectively enforce policies at runtime. This practical limitation has triggered the implementation of direct information flow analyzers in different language settings. In this paper, we focus on direct flows of information confidentiality in hybrid-dynamic environments and propose a semantic framework through which we can judge about such flows. This semantic framework can be used to study the correctness of enforced policies by these analyzers, and in particular taint tracking tools. In this regard, we specify a dynamic taint tracking policy for hybrid dynamic systems and prove its soundness based on the proposed semantic framework. As a case study, we consider the flow of information in a public transportation control system, and the effectiveness of our enforced policy on this system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457339.3457981;;;Systems AND Control
Lightweight Dynamic Redundancy Control with Adaptive Encoding for Server-based Storage;;;['Takayuki Fukatani', 'Hieu Hanh Le', 'Haruo Yokota'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Storage;;;With the recent performance improvements in commodity hardware, low-cost commodity server-based storage has become a practical alternative to dedicated-storage appliances. Because of the high failure rate of commodity servers, data redundancy across multiple servers is required in a server-based storage system. However, the extra storage capacity for this redundancy significantly increases the system cost. Although erasure coding (EC) is a promising method to reduce the amount of redundant data, it requires distributing and encoding data among servers. There remains a need to reduce the performance impact of these processes involving much network traffic and processing overhead. Especially, the performance impact becomes significant for random-intensive applications. In this article, we propose a new lightweight redundancy control for server-based storage. Our proposed method uses a new local filesystem-based approach that avoids distributing data by adding data redundancy to locally stored user data. Our method switches the redundancy method of user data between replication and EC according to workloads to improve capacity efficiency while achieving higher performance. Our experiments show up to 230% better online-transaction-processing performance for our method compared with CephFS, a widely used alternative system. We also confirmed that our proposed method prevents unexpected performance degradation while achieving better capacity efficiency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3456292;;;Systems AND Control

Learning similar coordinated locomotion in articulated virtual characters, in the absence of reference motion data, is a challenging task due to the high number of degrees of freedom and the redundancy that comes with it. In this paper, we present a method for learning locomotion for virtual characters in a low dimensional latent space which defines how different joints move together. We introduce a technique called motor babble, wherein a character interacts with its environment by actuating its joints through uncoordinated, low-level (motor) excitations, resulting in a corpus of motion data from which a manifold latent space is extracted. Dimensions of the extracted manifold define a wide variety of synergies pertaining to the character and, through reinforcement learning, we train the character to learn locomotion in the latent space by selecting a small set of appropriate latent dimensions, along with learning the corresponding policy.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487983.3488291;;;Systems AND Control

Inferring Switched Nonlinear Dynamical
Systems;;;['Xiangyu Jin', 'Jie An', 'Bohua Zhan', 'Naijun Zhan', 'Miaomiao Zhang'];;;None;;;Formal Aspects of Computing;;;AbstractIdentification of dynamical and hybrid systems using trajectory data is an important way to construct
models for complex systems where derivation from first principles is too difficult. In this paper, we study the
identification problem for switched dynamical systems with polynomial ODEs. This is a difficult problem as
it combines estimating coefficients for nonlinear dynamics and determining boundaries between modes. We
propose two different algorithms for this problem, depending on whether to perform prior segmentation of
trajectories. For methods with prior segmentation, we present a heuristic segmentation algorithm and a way to
classify themodes using clustering. Formethods without prior segmentation, we extend identification techniques
for piecewise affine models to our problem. To estimate derivatives along the given trajectories, we use Linear
MultistepMethods. Finally, we propose a way to evaluate an identified model by computing a relative difference
between the predicted and actual derivatives. Based on this evaluation method, we perform experiments on
five switched dynamical systems with different parameters, for a total of twenty cases. We also compare with
three baseline methods: clustering with DBSCAN, standard optimization methods in SciPy and identification of
ARX models in Matlab, as well as with state-of-the-art identification method for piecewise affine models. The
experiments show that our two methods perform better across a wide range of situations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00165-021-00542-7;;;Systems AND Control
Control Plane Reflection Attacks and Defenses in Software-Defined Networks;;;['Menghao Zhang', 'Guanyu Li', 'Lei Xu', 'Jiasong Bai', 'Mingwei Xu', 'Guofei Gu', 'Jianping Wu'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;Software-Defined Networking (SDN) continues to be deployed spanning from enterprise data centers to cloud computing with the proliferation of various SDN-enabled hardware switches and dynamic control plane applications. However, state-of-the-art SDN-enabled hardware switches have rather limited downlink message processing capability, especially for <italic>Flow-Mod</italic> and <italic>Statistic Query</italic>, which may not suffice the huge need of dynamic control plane applications. In this paper, we systematically study the interactions between the control plane applications and the data plane switches, and present two new attacks, namely Control Plane Reflection Attacks, to exploit the limited processing capability of SDN-enabled hardware switches. The reflection attacks adopt direct and indirect data plane events to force the control plane to issue massive expensive downlink messages towards SDN switches. Moreover, we propose a two-phase probing-triggering attack strategy, which makes the reflection attacks much more efficient and powerful. Experiments on a testbed with 3 different physical OpenFlow switches demonstrate that the attacks can lead to catastrophic results such as hurting the establishment of new flows and even disruption of connection between SDN controller and switches. To mitigate such attacks, we present several countermeasures from different perspectives. In particular, we propose a novel, systematical defense framework, SwitchGuard, to detect anomalies of downlink messages and prioritize these messages based on a novel monitoring granularity, i.e., host-application pair (HAP). Implementations and evaluations demonstrate that SwitchGuard can effectively reduce the latency for legitimate hosts and applications under the control plane reflection attacks with only minor overheads.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2020.3040773;;;Systems AND Control

Based on data from N=19 participants who participated in a driving simulator experiment, we find evidence that the transfer of control often does not take place in one step. In other words, when the automated system requests the transfer of control back to the driver, the driver often does not simply stop the non-driving task. Rather, the transfer unfolds as a process of interleaving the non-driving and driving tasks. We also find that the process is moderated by the length of time available for the transfer of control: interleaving is more likely when more time is available. Our interface designs for automated vehicles must take these results into account so as to allow drivers to safely take back control from automation.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3409118.3475128;;;Systems AND Control

In the current situation, Industrial Control System (ICS) is the Industrial Control System. This technology has been active in a wide range of different fields. In various projects, about 90% of the state-owned infrastructure relies on Industrial Control System to realize automatic operation. For national key infrastructure projects, ICS has become an indispensable part, and national strategic security is gradually inseparable from ICS. The work environment of ICS is becoming more and more complex. In addition, in the traditional network, people can use digital identification, encryption and other methods to deal with information leakage, network attacks and other security risks, but the embedded system resources in ICS are often limited, which requires a high real-time service. When the system does what it's supposed to do, and at the same time, ICS agrees to security requirements such as encryption algorithms or security protocols, its business continuity will face huge challenges and traditional solutions will be difficult to fit into ICS. In this paper, according to the ARIMA modelling method of industrial control network flow, the flow model of common industrial control network is established.

Evaluating Grasping Visualizations and Control Modes in a VR Game;;;['Alex Adkins', 'Lorraine Lin', 'Aline Normoyle', 'Ryan Canales', 'Yuting Ye', 'Sophie Jörg'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Applied Perception;;;A primary goal of the Virtual Reality (VR) community is to build fully immersive and presence-inducing environments with seamless and natural interactions. To reach this goal, researchers are investigating how to best directly use our hands to interact with a virtual environment using hand tracking. Most studies in this field require participants to perform repetitive tasks. In this article, we investigate if results of such studies translate into a real application and game-like experience. We designed a virtual escape room in which participants interact with various objects to gather clues and complete puzzles. In a between-subjects study, we examine the effects of two input modalities (controllers vs. hand tracking) and two grasping visualizations (continuously tracked hands vs. virtual hands that disappear when grasping) on ownership, realism, efficiency, enjoyment, and presence. Our results show that ownership, realism, enjoyment, and presence increased when using hand tracking compared to controllers. Visualizing the tracked hands during grasps leads to higher ratings in one of our ownership questions and one of our enjoyment questions compared to having the virtual hands disappear during grasps as is common in many applications.

Optimizing CoW-based file systems on open-channel SSDs with persistent memory;;;['Runyu Zhang', 'Duo Liu', 'Chaoshu Yang', 'Xianzhang Chen', 'Lei Qiao', 'Yujuan Tan'];;;March 2022;;;DATE '22: Proceedings of the 2022 Conference &amp; Exhibition on Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe;;;Block-based file systems, such as Btrfs, utilize the copy-on-write (CoW) mechanism to guarantee data consistency on solid-state drives (SSDs). Open-channel SSD provides opportunities for in-depth optimization of block-based file systems. However, existing systems fail to co-design the two-layer semantics and cannot take full advantage of the open-channel characteristics. Specifically, synchronizing an overwrite in Btrfs will copy-on-write all pages in the update path and induce severe write amplification. In this paper, we propose a hybrid fine-grained copy-on-write and journaling mechanism (HyFiM) to address these problems. We first utilize persistent memories to preserve the address mapping table of open-channel SSD. Then, we design an intra-FTL copy-on-write mechanism (IFCoW) that eliminates the recursive updates caused by overwrites. Finally, we devise fine-grained metadata journals (FGMJ) to guarantee the consistency of metadata with minimum overhead. We prototype HyFiM based on Btrfs in the Linux kernel. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HyFiM can outperform over Btrfs by 30.77% and 33.82% for sequential and random overwrites, respectively.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3539845.3539961;;;Systems AND Control

Using active queries to infer symmetric node functions of graph dynamical systems;;;['Abhijin Adiga', 'Chris J. Kuhlman', 'Madhav V. Marathe', 'S. S. Ravi', 'Daniel J. Rosenkrantz', 'Richard E.

Using a discrete dynamical system to model a networked social system, the problem of inferring the behavior of the system can be formulated as the problem of learning the local functions of the dynamical system. We investigate the problem assuming an active form of interaction with the system through queries. We consider two classes of local functions (namely, symmetric and threshold functions) and two interaction modes, namely batch (where all the queries must be submitted together) and adaptive (where the set of queries submitted at a stage may rely on the answers to previous queries). We establish bounds on the number of queries under both batch and adaptive query modes using vertex coloring and probabilistic methods. Our results show that a small number of appropriately chosen queries are provably sufficient to correctly learn all the local functions. We develop complexity results which suggest that, in general, the problem of generating query sets of minimum size is computationally intractable. We present efficient heuristics that produce query sets under both batch and adaptive query modes. Also, we present a query compaction algorithm that identifies and removes redundant queries from a given query set.

The solutions can significantly enhance the ability of manufacturers and operators to manage the on-board loadable software, reduce the time spent in copying and distributing the physical media, which can also contribute to aircraft predictive maintenance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503047.3503053;;;Systems AND Control
A Lightweight Architecture for Hardware-Based Security in the Emerging Era of Systems of Systems;;;['Nico Mexis', 'Nikolaos Athanasios Anagnostopoulos', 'Shuai Chen', 'Jan Bambach', 'Tolga Arul', 'Stefan Katzenbeisser'];;;None;;;ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems;;;In recent years, a new generation of the Internet of Things (IoT 2.0) is emerging, based on artificial intelligence, the blockchain technology, machine learning, and the constant consolidation of pre-existing systems and subsystems into larger systems. In this work, we construct and examine a proof-of-concept prototype of such a system of systems, which consists of heterogeneous commercial off-the-shelf components, and utilises diverse communication protocols. We recognise the inherent need for lightweight security in this context, and address it by employing a low-cost state-of-the-art security solution. Our solution is based on a novel hardware and software co-engineering paradigm, utilising well-known software-based cryptographic algorithms, in order to maximise the security potential of the hardware security primitive (a Physical Unclonable Function) that is used as a security anchor. The performance of the proposed security solution is evaluated, proving its suitability even for real-time applications. Additionally, the Dolev-Yao attacker model is considered in order to assess the resilience of our solution towards attacks against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the examined system of systems. In this way, it is confirmed that the proposed solution is able to address the emerging security challenges of the oncoming era of systems of systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458824;;;Systems AND Control
Safety from in-the-loop reachability for cyber-physical systems;;;['Christian Llanes', 'Matthew Abate', 'Samuel Coogan'];;;May 2021;;;CAADCPS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Computation-Aware Algorithmic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;We demonstrate a methodology for achieving safe autonomy that relies on computing reachable sets at runtime. Given a system subject to disturbances controlled by an unverified and potentially faulty controller, this methodology computes at each time the reachable set of the system under a backup control law to ensure the system is within reach of a known a priori safe region. Control barrier functions are then used in conjunction with the reachable set to adjust potentially unsafe control actions that would otherwise move the system beyond reach of this safe set. This approach faces several computational challenges: reachable sets for the dynamics must be computed at runtime; sensitivity of the reachable set to initial conditions is required for the control barrier optimization formulation; and the presence of disturbances introduces a large number of constraints in the resulting optimization. The proposed methodology leverages the theory of mixed monotone systems to address these challenges, and the main contribution of this paper is an application of this methodology to a ten dimensional dual planar multirotor system that is implemented on embedded hardware with a controller update rate up to 100Hz.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457335.3461706;;;Systems AND Control
Design and Realisation of Scalable Business Process Management Systems for Deployment in the Cloud;;;['Chun Ouyang', 'Michael Adams', 'Arthur H. M. Ter Hofstede', 'Yang Yu'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems;;;Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs) provide automated support for the execution of business processes in modern organisations. With the emergence of cloud computing, BPMS deployment considerations are shifting from traditional on-premise models to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigm, aiming at delivering Business Process Automation as a Service. However, scaling up a traditional BPMS to cope with simultaneous demand from multiple organisations in the cloud is challenging, since its underlying system architecture has been designed to serve a single organisation with a single process engine. Moreover, the complexity in addressing both the dynamic execution environment and the elasticity requirements of users impose further challenges to deploying a traditional BPMS in the cloud. A typical SaaS often deploys multiple instances of its core applications and distributes workload to these application instances via load balancing. But, for stateful and often long-running process instances, standard stateless load balancing strategies are inadequate. In this article, we propose a conceptual design of BPMS capable of addressing dynamically varying demands of end users in the cloud, and present a prototypical implementation using an open source traditional BPMS platform. Both the design and system realisation offer focused strategies on achieving scalability and demonstrates the system capabilities for supporting both upscaling, to address large volumes of user demand or workload, and downscaling, to release underutilised computing resources, in a cloud environment.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460123;;;Systems AND Control

This type of networks is vastly different from terrestrial wireless sensor networks and tremendous work have accelerated the realization. However, very few works study the issue of underwater data collection and network nodes control, which is crucial in many real applications. This calls for a new underwater acoustic network design. In this paper we present a Wi-Fi based underwater acoustic network, called uw-WiFi. which is robust, highly customizable, energy efficient to tackle the real harsh underwater environment and meet the diverse application requirements. We first give a detailed design of uw-WiFi including the network architecture and protocols at different layers. Following that, we conduct a case study with 5 different kinds of network nodes.

Cascaded Random Fourier Filter for Robust Nonlinear Active Noise Control;;;['Yingying Zhu', 'Haiquan Zhao', 'Xiaoqiong He', 'Zeliang Shu', 'Badong Chen'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing;;;The random Fourier filter-based filtered-x least mean square (RF-FxLMS) algorithm has been proposed for the nonlinear active noise control (NANC) system to reduce the computational burden of the kernel filter. However, the RF-FxLMS algorithm markedly fluctuates when dealing with impulsive noise. In addition, the computing cost for the RF-FxLMS algorithm is still pricey in practice. In this work, a random Fourier filter based filtered-x generalized hyperbolic secant function (RF-FxGHSF) algorithm is presented to deal with impulsive noise. In virtue of the bilinear scheme, a cascaded random Fourier filter model is designed for concise computations, and the cascaded RF-FxGHSF (CRF-FxGHSF) algorithm is derived. Moreover, the steady-state convergence conditions are analyzed. The calculation complexity of the proposed algorithms is compared, and experiments emphatically analyze the principle for the presented model.

A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Real-Time Control for Transfer Limits of Critical Inter-Corridors;;;['Fei Xue', 'Hongqiang Li', 'Jili Wang', 'Gao Qiu', 'Junyong Liu', 'Youbo Liu', 'Tingjian Liu', 'Tianxiang Wang'];;;December 2021;;;EEET 2021: 2021 4th International Conference on Electronics and Electrical Engineering Technology;;;Controlling transfer power flow below transfer limits of inter-corridors is crucial for power system security. Traditional way that empirically decides pessimistic limits incurs low utilization of inter-corridors. To improve operational flexibility, a real-time intelligent controller that enables precise tracking for transfer limits is carried out. The concerned problem is firstly modelled based on the limit qualification by total transfer capability (TTC). To allow real-time controller, which is reinforcement learning (RL), to learn control law from the model, a physics and data co-driven interactive environment is built, where computational intractable TTC-induced security criterion is substituted by pre-trained supervised learners. Numerical studies on the modified IEEE 39-bus system manifest the reliability and impressive efficiency of the proposed method on transfer limits control.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508297.3508318;;;Systems AND Control
Designing Hydra with Centralized versus Decentralized Control: A Comparative Study;;;['Siqi Liu', 'Varun Patil', 'Tianyuan Yu', 'Alexander Afanasyev', 'Frank Alex Feltus', 'Susmit Shannigrahi', 'Lixia Zhang'];;;December 2021;;;IWCI'21: Proceedings of the Interdisciplinary Workshop on (de) Centralization in the Internet;;;Today's networked and distributed applications, by and large, rely on cloud services. However, solely cloud-based services are not the ideal solution for all use cases, in particular, the case of high volume data sharing in scientific computing whose cloud usage costs could be prohibitively high. Thus we take on a task of building a distributed, federated data repository, dubbed Hydra, for sharing large volume scientific data. In this paper, we compare two design choices: designing Hydra over TCP/IP with a centralized controller, and designing Hydra over Named Data Network (NDN) to enable distributed control. Our study shows that (i) building Hydra over TCP/IP with a central controller offers a simple, straightforward design; (ii) however, the controller necessarily needs to be replicated for scalability and reliability, and cloud CDN is needed to scale data delivery, both bringing additional complexity into the overall design; and (iii) building Hydra over NDN automatically offers scalable and efficient data dissemination at volume, as well as enables distributed control with high resiliency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488663.3493690;;;Systems AND Control
Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control as a Model of Multimodal Behavioral Coordination;;;['Lauren Klein', 'Victor Ardulov', 'Alma Gharib', 'Barbara Thompson', 'Pat Levitt', 'Maja Matarić'];;;October 2021;;;ICMI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction;;;Observing how infants and mothers coordinate their behaviors can highlight meaningful patterns in early communication and infant development. While dyads often differ in the modalities they use to communicate, especially in the first year of life, it remains unclear how to capture coordination across multiple types of behaviors using existing computational models of interpersonal synchrony. This paper explores Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) as a method of integrating multiple signals from each communicating partner into a model of multimodal behavioral coordination. We used an existing video dataset to track the head pose, arm pose, and vocal fundamental frequency of infants and mothers during the Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) procedure, a validated 3-stage interaction paradigm. For each recorded interaction, we fit both unimodal and multimodal DMDc models to the extracted pose data. The resulting dynamic characteristics of the models were analyzed to evaluate trends in individual behaviors and dyadic processes across infant age and stages of the interactions. Results demonstrate that observed trends in interaction dynamics across stages of the FFSF protocol were stronger and more significant when models incorporated both head and arm pose data, rather than a single behavior modality. Model output showed significant trends across age, identifying changes in infant movement and in the relationship between infant and mother behaviors. Models that included mothers’ audio data demonstrated similar results to those evaluated with pose data, confirming that DMDc can leverage different sets of behavioral signals from each interacting partner. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential of DMDc toward integrating multiple behavioral signals into the measurement of multimodal interpersonal coordination.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462244.3479916;;;Systems AND Control
Discussing the Availability Quality Attribute in Systems-of-Systems Architectures based on a Simulation Experiment;;;['Rodrigo Lima', 'Mohamad Kassab', 'Valdemar Neto'];;;September 2021;;;SBES '21: Proceedings of the XXXV Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering;;;Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a set of independent software-intensive systems intended to support critical domains, such as emergency and crisis response systems and health. As such, SoS should exhibit robust behaviors and guarantee that the entire system is continuously available, not failing and leaving its users helpless. However, the SoS inherent dynamic architecture can potentially affect the availability of the functionalities being offered by the SoS. Hence, it is prominently important to anticipate, at design-time, the degree of availability an SoS can offer and provide mechanisms to reinforce the availability provided by it. Usually, software architects use static models to predict quality attributes in software architectures. However, these models are not well-succeeded to deal with the dynamic nature of the SoS architectures. The main contribution of this paper is thus presenting emerging results on the establishment of a simulation-based approach for empirically predicting the availability of SoS software architectures at design time. A Flood Monitoring SoS was used as the experimental platform. Preliminary results indicate that, specifically for the context of our study, the nature of availability in SoS architectures was not only influenced by the availability of the SoS constituents, but also by the SoS topology.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474624.3477058;;;Systems AND Control
A novel technique for control flow obfuscation in JVM applications using InvokeDynamic with native bootstrapping;;;['Bradley Wood', 'Akramul Azim'];;;November 2021;;;CASCON '21: Proceedings of the 31st Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering;;;Protecting the intellectual property of end-user software is a challenging industry problem. Modern obfuscation techniques aim to prevent reverse engineering and unauthorized use or modification to software. Obfuscation algorithms are especially necessary in JVM applications due to the large amount of contextual information stored in JVM bytecode. However, many commercial-grade obfuscation methods can be easily be undone by deobfuscation software such that it can later be decompiled and refactored for illegitimate use. In this paper, we propose a method of control flow obfuscation using the InvokeDynamic instruction with native call site bootstrapping. The proposed method prevents JVM byte-code from leaking call site information in function invocations. We evaluate the proposed technique against a series of benchmarks comparing original software with its obfuscated form. To this end, we observe an insignificant difference in application running time.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3507788.3507824;;;Systems AND Control

Emerging technologies have developed smart and intelligent manufacturing systems. Latest manufacturing systems have overcome the issues related to communication, integration, data sharing, coordination, and autonomous behavior. Similarly, these technologies also address the issue related to self-awareness, complex structures, upscaling, and heterogeneity. Internet of things, holonic technology and agent-based systems are employed in manufacturing industries to overcome different issues and production inefficiencies. With ever-changing needs and market environment, the manufacturing sector must keep up with the pace by using these modern technologies. This paper summarizes the role of agent-based systems in providing robust solutions for the deficiencies in manufacturing. Agent-based systems can be used in the whole value chain of the manufacturing unit ranging from processes, machine assembly, production line, logistics to supply chain. Agent-based systems integrate all these units to exchange information and to use various resources by making autonomous decisions. Agents are smart and intelligent and take decisions through reasoning and continuous learning. Agents based systems can be integrated with holonic technologies, AI and Internet of things to further enhance the manufacturing capabilities. Integration of agent-based systems with other technologies and applications are discussed in this review.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3523132.3523141;;;Systems AND Control

For trajectory control, an Amnesia recovery control coupled with classical proportional integral and derivative (PID) control was used in this work. The space robots are controlled to trace the circular trajectory with a unit mass. Further work can be done by increasing the weight of the body and size of the body.

A Design Space for Privacy Choices: Towards Meaningful Privacy Control in the Internet of Things;;;['Yuanyuan Feng', 'Yaxing Yao', 'Norman Sadeh'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;“Notice and choice” is the predominant approach for data privacy protection today. There is considerable user-centered research on providing effective privacy notices but not enough guidance on designing privacy choices. Recent data privacy regulations worldwide established new requirements for privacy choices, but system practitioners struggle to implement legally compliant privacy choices that also provide users meaningful privacy control. We construct a design space for privacy choices based on a user-centered analysis of how people exercise privacy choices in real-world systems. This work contributes a conceptual framework that considers privacy choice as a user-centered process as well as a taxonomy for practitioners to design meaningful privacy choices in their systems.

Research on Control Strategy of Distributed Generation Grid-connected Inverter;;;['Haijun Cheng', 'Haoxiang Hong', 'Min Jiang'];;;October 2021;;;AIAM2021: 2021 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacture;;;Under the carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals, it is inevitable to build a new power system with new energy as the main body. The grid-connected operation of distributed power must be able to meet the requirements of voltage and frequency support of the grid. This paper presents multiple control modes of grid-connected inverter, including dispatching mode and no dispatching mode. Then, droop control strategy based on multi-mode switching and zone control strategy based on offset are proposed. The droop control strategy of multi-mode switching is to make the inverter run in different modes such as f-P, V-Q and P-Q according to information for power system dispatching. The zone control strategy based on the offset is the inverter adopts different control methods when power system run in different regions that was divided according to the offset, and enables the distributed power to participate in the power grid voltage and frequency adjustment independently.

A Survey on Conversational Recommender Systems;;;['Dietmar Jannach', 'Ahtsham Manzoor', 'Wanling Cai', 'Li Chen'];;;None;;;ACM Computing Surveys;;;Recommender systems are software applications that help users to find items of interest in situations of information overload. Current research often assumes a one-shot interaction paradigm, where the users’ preferences are estimated based on past observed behavior and where the presentation of a ranked list of suggestions is the main, one-directional form of user interaction. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can, for example, help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing, the emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants, and the increased use of chatbot technology. With this article, we provide a detailed survey of existing approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in various dimensions, e.g., in terms of the supported user intents or the knowledge they use in the background. Moreover, we discuss technological approaches, review how CRS are evaluated, and finally identify a number of gaps that deserve more research in the future.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453154;;;Systems AND Control
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Tropical Air Free-cooled Data Center Control;;;['Duc Van Le', 'Rongrong Wang', 'Yingbo Liu', 'Rui Tan', 'Yew-Wah Wong', 'Yonggang Wen'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks;;;Air free-cooled data centers (DCs) have not existed in the tropical zone due to the unique challenges of year-round high ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). The increasing availability of servers that can tolerate higher temperatures and RH due to the regulatory bodies’ prompts to raise DC temperature setpoints sheds light upon the feasibility of air free-cooled DCs in the tropics. However, due to the complex psychrometric dynamics, operating the air free-cooled DC in the tropics generally requires adaptive control of supply air condition to maintain the computing performance and reliability of the servers. This article studies the problem of controlling the supply air temperature and RH in a free-cooled tropical DC below certain thresholds. To achieve the goal, we formulate the control problem as Markov decision processes and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the control policy that minimizes the cooling energy while satisfying the requirements on the supply air temperature and RH. We also develop a constrained DRL solution for performance improvements. Extensive evaluation based on real data traces collected from an air free-cooled testbed and comparisons among the unconstrained and constrained DRL approaches as well as two other baseline approaches show the superior performance of our proposed solutions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3439332;;;Systems AND Control
Research on Coordinated Control of Supercritical Unit Based on ADRC;;;['Yi Liu', 'Jie Ren', 'Jirong Zhang', 'Cuiping Pu'];;;October 2021;;;ICITEE '21: Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Information Technologies and Electrical Engineering;;;The coordinated control object of supercritical units is characterized by multivariable coupling, strong nonlinearity and uncertainty. For multivariable system Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), the coupling between channels can be regarded as disturbance, which can be estimated by Extended State Observer (ESO) of each channel. For strongly coupled system, the coupling may not be eliminated in time. The coupling between loops is regarded as internal disturbance, and the internal and external disturbances of the system are observed and compensated as a total disturbance by the Improved ADRC(IADRC). An IADRC method based on similar feedforward decoupling is proposed. Simulation results show that the decoupling performance, tracking performance and robustness of the feedforward-like decoupling IADRC control method are better than those of ADRC control scheme.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3513142.3513189;;;Systems AND Control
REPAIR: Control Flow Protection based on Register Pairing Updates for SW-Implemented HW Fault Tolerance;;;['Uzair Sharif', 'Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder', 'Ulf Schlichtmann'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Safety-critical embedded systems may either use specialized hardware or rely on Software-Implemented Hardware Fault Tolerance (SIHFT) to meet soft error resilience requirements. SIHFT has the advantage that it can be used with low-cost, off-the-shelf components such as standard Micro-Controller Units. For this, SIHFT methods apply redundancy in software computation and special checker codes to detect transient errors, so called soft errors, that either corrupt the data flow or the control flow of the software and may lead to Silent Data Corruption (SDC). So far, this is done by applying separate SIHFT methods for the data and control flow protection, which leads to large overheads in computation time.This work in contrast presents REPAIR, a method that exploits the checks of the SIHFT data flow protection to also detect control flow errors as well, thereby, yielding higher SDC resilience with less computational overhead. For this, the data flow protection methods entail duplicating the computation with subsequent checks placed strategically throughout the program. These checks assure that the two redundant computation paths, which work on two different parts of the register file, yield the same result. By updating the pairing between the registers used in the primary computation path and the registers in the duplicated computation path using the REPAIR method, these checks also fail with high coverage when a control flow error, which leads to an illegal jumps, occurs. Extensive RTL fault injection simulations are carried out to accurately quantify soft error resilience while evaluating Mibench programs along with an embedded case-study running on an OpenRISC processor. Our method performs slightly better on average in terms of soft error resilience compared to the best state-of-the-art method but requiring significantly lower overheads. These results show that REPAIR is a valuable addition to the set of known SIHFT methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477001;;;Systems AND Control

Speech recognition is an extremely challenging technique for cost-effective human contact, communication, and control. Numerous experiments have been undertaken on voice recognition systems in order to provide a more complete explanation of language commands, particularly for non-native English speakers and languages with tone variations. This article outlines the development of a Raspberry Pi-based spoken command system. The system was developed and installed using Python, and it makes use of the Google Speech Recognition API as a speech-to-text converter. Our light control system's speech recognition system is capable of receiving voice commands via a USB microphone. The experimental results compare the accuracy of light control for Thai and English orders utilizing individuals who are Thai elderly speakers. Thai speech is recognized more precisely than English speech by the suggested approach. These startling findings refute the concept that speech recognition algorithms can boost the growth of the Internet of Things. However, the system's accuracy in recognizing speech for disabled and elderly users should be weighed against the country's national or indigenous languages.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3520084.3520090;;;Systems AND Control
SDNShield: NFV-Based Defense Framework Against DDoS Attacks on SDN Control Plane;;;['Kuan-Yin Chen', 'Sen Liu', 'Yang Xu', 'Ishant Kumar Siddhrau', 'Siyu Zhou', 'Zehua Guo', 'H. Jonathan Chao'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;Software-defined networking (SDN) is increasingly popular in today&#x2019;s information technology industry, but existing SDN control plane is insufficiently scalable to support on-demand, high-frequency flow requests. Weaknesses along SDN control paths can be exploited by malicious third parties to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the SDN control plane. Recently proposed solutions only partially solve the problem, by protecting either the SDN network edges or the centralized controller. We propose SDNShield, a solution based on emerging network function virtualization (NFV) technologies, which enforces more comprehensive defense against potential DDoS attacks on SDN control plane. SDNShield incorporates a three-stage overload control scheme. The first stage statistically identifies legitimate flows with low complexity and performance overhead. The second stage further performs in-depth TCP handshake verification to ensure good flows are eventually served. The third stage intellectually salvages the misclassified legitimate flows that are falsely dropped from the first two stages. Prototype tests and real data-driven simulation results show that SDNShield can achieve high resilience against brute-force attacks, and maintain good flow-level service quality at the same time.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3105187;;;Systems AND Control

Pressure Control in High Pressure Oil Pipes by Equations of Mathematical Physics;;;['Ruitian Huang', 'Haonan Gu'];;;May 2021;;;ICAIIS 2021: 2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Information Systems;;;High-pressure oil pipes are widely used in all kinds of machinery and engineering, but the intermittent nature of fuel entering and ejecting the oil pipe makes it difficult to control the pressure in the pipe. This paper mainly studies how to design the scheduling strategy of the oil pipe pump according to the mathematical physical equations of the change of fuel pressure in the high-pressure oil pipe. In this paper, an efficient search algorithm is proposed, and the method of estimating the optimal value is used to avoid the algorithm from falling into the local optimal. We find in order to stabilize the pressure in the pipe at 100MPa, the optimal opening time of the one-way valve in one cycle is 0.2859ms. Benefit the basic model, we give a solution to increase form 100MPa within 2s and stabilize at 150MPa: before 2s, the opening time of the one-way valve is 1.1089ms; after 2s, the opening time is adjusted to 0.7526ms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3469213.3470388;;;Systems AND Control
Multimodal mobility systems: joint optimization of transit network design and pricing;;;['Qi Luo', 'Samitha Samaranayake', 'Siddhartha Banerjee'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;The performance of multimodal mobility systems relies on the seamless integration of conventional mass transit services and the advent of Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services. Prior work is limited to individually improving various transport networks' operations or linking a new mode to an existing system. In this work, we attempt to solve transit network design and pricing problems of multimodal mobility systems en masse. An operator (public transit agency or private transit operator) determines frequency settings of the mass transit system, flows of the MoD service, and prices for each trip to optimize the overall welfare. A primal-dual approach, inspired by the market design literature, yields a compact mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. However, a key computational challenge remains in allocating an exponential number of hybrid modes accessible to travelers. We provide a tractable solution approach through a decomposition scheme and approximation algorithm that accelerates the computation and enables optimization of large-scale problem instances.

Brain-Controlled Robotic Arm Grasping System Based on Adaptive TRCA;;;['Zhaokun Wang', 'Banghua Yang', 'Wen Wang', 'Dong Zhang', 'Xuelin Gu'];;;October 2021;;;ICCPR '21: Proceedings of the 2021 10th International Conference on Computing and Pattern Recognition;;;The SSVEP-BCI system used in actual scenarios usually uses fixed time window length decoding to analyze EEG signals, which cannot achieve decoding window length adaptation, resulting in low overall system operating efficiency. To solve this problem, this article uses an adaptive TRCA-based SSVEP EEG decoding algorithm. It can establish an individualized spatial filter based on the collected training data to maximize the extraction of effective EEG signals, at the same time, Bayesian estimation is used to dynamically find the optimal data length. In this paper, a brain-controlled robotic arm grasping system based on adaptive TRCA is constructed. Ten subjects were recruited for system testing, and 400 online tests were performed on the system using fixed window and adaptive methods. The test results show that the system is stable and reliable, and the accuracy of decoding EEG signals can reach 95% within 1.5 seconds, which can be used to assist people with disabilities in their daily lives.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3497623.3497682;;;Systems AND Control
Application analysis of automatic control technology in agricultural cultivator;;;['Yong Li', 'Jing Tao'];;;October 2021;;;AIAM2021: 2021 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacture;;;With the progress of science and technology, the updating speed of scientific and technological products has become faster and faster. The traditional agricultural production mode has long been unable to meet the needs of people at this stage. In order to further improve the production efficiency and production quality of modern agriculture, automatic control technology needs to be applied in agricultural machinery. This paper analyzes and discusses the development status and Prospect of automatic control technology in agricultural culture. The popularization and use of agricultural machinery plays an important role in improving soil fertility and increasing crop income. Therefore, during the development of Agricultural cultivator, relevant personnel should further clarify the status quo of automation development, manufacturing agricultural machinery and development direction, so as to provide more support to agricultural production efficiency and production level.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3495018.3502483;;;Systems AND Control
Linearization and identification of multiple-attractor dynamical systems through Laplacian eigenmaps;;;['Bernardo Fichera', 'Aude Billard'];;;None;;;The Journal of Machine Learning Research;;;Dynamical Systems (DS) are fundamental to the modeling and understanding time evolving phenomena, and have application in physics, biology and control. As determining an analytical description of the dynamics is often difficult, data-driven approaches are preferred for identifying and controlling nonlinear DS with multiple equilibrium points. Identification of such DS has been treated largely as a supervised learning problem. Instead, we focus on an unsupervised learning scenario where we know neither the number nor the type of dynamics. We propose a Graph-based spectral clustering method that takes advantage of a velocity-augmented kernel to connect data points belonging to the same dynamics, while preserving the natural temporal evolution. We study the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Graph Laplacian and show that they form a set of orthogonal embedding spaces, one for each sub-dynamics. We prove that there always exist a set of 2-dimensional embedding spaces in which the sub-dynamics are linear and n-dimensional embedding spaces where they are quasi-linear. We compare the clustering performance of our algorithm to Kernel K-Means, Spectral Clustering and Gaussian Mixtures and show that, even when these algorithms are provided with the correct number of sub-dynamics, they fail to cluster them correctly. We learn a diffeomorphism from the Laplacian embedding space to the original space and show that the Laplacian embedding leads to good reconstruction accuracy and a faster training time through an exponential decaying loss compared to the state-of-the-art diffeomorphism-based approaches.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586883;;;Systems AND Control
Truncated emphatic temporal difference methods for prediction and control;;;['Shangtong Zhang', 'Shimon Whiteson'];;;None;;;The Journal of Machine Learning Research;;;Emphatic Temporal Diérence (TD) methods are a class of off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods involving the use of followon traces. Despite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the notorious deadly triad of off-policy RL, there are still two open problems. First, followon traces typically suffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Second, though Yu (2015) confirms the asymptotic convergence of some emphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample analysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this paper, we address those two open problems simultaneously via using truncated followon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces, which depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only finite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of our proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586742;;;Systems AND Control
Multi-task dynamical systems;;;['Alex Bird', 'Christopher K. I.

We are interested in how time series models can be specialized to individual sequences (capturing the specific characteristics) while still retaining statistical power by sharing commonalities across the sequences. This paper describes the multi-task dynamical system (MTDS); a general methodology for extending multi-task learning (MTL) to time series models. Our approach endows dynamical systems with a set of hierarchical latent variables which can modulate all model parameters. To our knowledge, this is a novel development of MTL, and applies to time series both with and without control inputs. We apply the MTDS to motion-capture data of people walking in various styles using a multi-task recurrent neural network (RNN), and to patient drug-response data using a multi-task pharmacodynamic model.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586819;;;Systems AND Control
Membership Inference Attacks Against Recommender Systems;;;['Minxing Zhang', 'Zhaochun Ren', 'Zihan Wang', 'Pengjie Ren', 'Zhunmin Chen', 'Pengfei Hu', 'Yang Zhang'];;;November 2021;;;CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;Recently, recommender systems have achieved promising performances and become one of the most widely used web applications. However, recommender systems are often trained on highly sensitive user data, thus potential data leakage from recommender systems may lead to severe privacy problems. In this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage of recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In contrast with traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our attack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but not on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the ordered recommended items from a recommender system instead of prediction results in the form of posterior probabilities. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method by representing users from relevant items. Moreover, a shadow recommender is established to derive the labeled training data for training the attack model. Extensive experimental results show that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we design a defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the membership inference threat of recommender systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484770;;;Systems AND Control

Spatial-temporal motion control via composite cam-follower mechanisms;;;['Yingjie Cheng', 'Yucheng Sun', 'Peng Song', 'Ligang Liu'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Graphics;;;Motion control, both on the trajectory and timing, is crucial for mechanical automata to perform functionalities such as walking and entertaining. We present composite cam-follower mechanisms that can control their spatial-temporal motions to exactly follow trajectories and timings specified by users, and propose a computational technique to model, design, and optimize these mechanisms. The building blocks of our mechanisms are a new kind of cam-follower mechanism with a modified joint, in which the follower can perform spatial motion on a planar, cylindrical, or spherical surface controlled by the 3D cam's profile. We parameterize the geometry of these cam-follower mechanisms, formulate analytical equations to model their kinematics and dynamics, and present a method to combine multiple cam-follower mechanisms into a working mechanism. Taking this modeling as a foundation, we propose a computational approach to designing and optimizing the geometry and layout of composite cam-follower mechanisms, with an objective of performing target spatial-temporal motions driving by a small motor torque. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by designing different kinds of personalized automata and showing results not attainable by conventional mechanisms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478513.3480477;;;Systems AND Control

Towards trustworthy AI: safe-visor architecture for uncertified controllers in stochastic cyber-physical systems;;;['Abolfazl Lavaei', 'Bingzhuo Zhong', 'Marco Caccamo', 'Majid Zamani'];;;May 2021;;;CAADCPS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Computation-Aware Algorithmic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Artificial intelligence-based (a.k.a. AI-based) controllers have received significant attentions in the past few years due to their broad applications in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) to accomplish complex control missions. However, guaranteeing safety and reliability of CPSs equipped with this kind of (uncertified) controllers is currently very challenging, which is of vital importance in many real-life safety-critical applications. To cope with this difficulty, we propose a Safe-visor architecture for sandboxing AI-based controllers in stochastic CPSs. The proposed framework contains (i) a history-based supervisor which checks inputs from the AI-based controller and makes compromise between functionality and safety of the system, and (ii) a safety advisor that provides fallback when the AI-based controller endangers the safety of the system. By employing this architecture, we provide formal probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of those classes of safety specifications which can be represented by the accepting languages of deterministic finite automata (DFA), while AI-based controllers can still be employed in the control loop even though they are not reliable.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457335.3461705;;;Systems AND Control

Automation, control, and analysis of knowledge-intensive processes;;;['Eric Yu', 'Arik Senderovich', 'Hajo A. Reijers', 'Allen Chan', 'Sebastian Carbajales'];;;November 2021;;;CASCON '21: Proceedings of the 31st Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering;;;Process automation has been a widely used methodology for improving business processes since the late 90's. Typically, automation was applied to well-structured and highly routine business processes. Knowledge-intensive processes that exhibit ad-hoc workflows and involve mainly knowledge workers are now becoming more and more common in most industries. Traditionally, these processes were considered harder to model, analyze and thus automate due to their unstructured and flexible nature. Recent advances in the worlds of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning supported by ample data availability has led to developments in knowledge-intensive process modeling, analysis, and automation. Specifically, applications such as natural language processing and information retrieval allows researchers to identify workflows in unstructured data (e.g., emails) and map ad-hoc behavior to workflow patterns. In this workshop, we aim at sharing experiences and research results on recent advances in data-driven approaches to process automation with a special emphasis on ad-hoc business processes, i.e., work patterns with no predefined process models. The workshop will explore theories, algorithms, and engineering methods at the intersection of AI and process management to develop next generation intelligent business automation solutions. Speakers will be researchers and industry leaders from diverse backgrounds including but not limited to process automation in knowledge-intensive processes, business process management, data-driven activity and workflow recognition, and flexible process mining using constraint learning. The workshop will give the audience a broad exposure to the field, and create opportunities for collaborations among academic research groups and industry teams between various partners that wish to develop The workshop will run as a single-session online event and will be adjusted to the special circumstances of the new normal under COVID-19 restrictions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3507788.3507846;;;Systems AND Control

Unmanned Car Path Tracking Control Method Based on Machine Learning;;;['Jianglin Lu'];;;October 2021;;;AIAM2021: 2021 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Manufacture;;;The research of driverless cars is human-centered, hoping to create a safe, comfortable, convenient, and environmentally friendly transportation environment. However, in practical applications, it is found that due to changes in external conditions such as road factors, the vehicle's motion state deviates from the initial set value or cannot be tracked to the target position in real time. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a method to track and control driverless cars. This article studies methods from machine learning, with the purpose of further improving driverless technology through artificial intelligence. This article mainly uses the experimental method and the comparative method to compare and analyze the two unmanned vehicle path tracking control experiments. The experimental results show that the distance errors are different, and the minimum error is 0.062. This error proves that comparing the tracking error is beneficial to distance prediction and driving control.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3495018.3495518;;;Systems AND Control
Model-bounded monitoring of hybrid systems;;;['Masaki Waga', 'Étienne André', 'Ichiro Hasuo'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Monitoring of hybrid systems attracts both scientific and practical attention. However, monitoring algorithms suffer from the methodological difficulty of only observing sampled discrete-time signals, while real behaviors are continuous-time signals. To mitigate this problem of sampling uncertainties, we introduce a model-bounded monitoring scheme, where we use prior knowledge about the target system to prune interpolation candidates. Technically, we express such prior knowledge by linear hybrid automata (LHAs)---the LHAs are called bounding models. We introduce a novel notion of monitored language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms---one is via reduction to reachability in LHAs and the other is a direct one using polyhedra---and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded monitoring scheme, are efficient and practically relevant.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3450531;;;Systems AND Control
Profiling dataflow systems on multiple abstraction levels;;;['Alexander Beischl', 'Timo Kersten', 'Maximilian Bandle', 'Jana Giceva', 'Thomas Neumann'];;;April 2021;;;EuroSys '21: Proceedings of the Sixteenth European Conference on Computer Systems;;;Dataflow graphs are a popular abstraction for describing computation, used in many systems for high-level optimization. For execution, dataflow graphs are lowered and optimized through layers of program representations down to machine instructions. Unfortunately, performance profiling such systems is cumbersome, as today's profilers present results merely at instruction and function granularity. This obfuscates the connection between profiles and high-level constructs, such as operators and pipelines, making interpretation of profiles an exercise in puzzling and deduction. In this paper, we show how to profile compiling dataflow systems at higher abstraction levels. Our approach tracks the code generation process and aggregates profiling data to any abstraction level. This bridges the semantic gap to match the engineer's current information need and even creates a comprehensible way to report timing information within profiling data. We have evaluated this approach within our compiling DBMS Umbra, showing that the approach is generally applicable for compiling dataflow systems and can be implemented with high accuracy and reasonable overhead.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456254;;;Systems AND Control

Industrial SysPE state of practice is generally model-based. Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of systems, there is a need to develop and establish model-driven methods and techniques. To structure the field of SysPE, we identify (1) industrial challenges motivating the importance of SysPE, (2) scientific challenges that need to be addressed to establish model-driven SysPE, (3) important focus areas for SysPE and (4) best practices. We conducted a survey to collect feedback on our views. The responses were used to update and validate the identified challenges, focus areas, and best practices. The final result is presented in this paper. Interesting observations are that industry sees a need for better design-space exploration support, more than for additional performance modeling and analysis techniques. Also tools and integral methods for SysPE need attention. From the identified focus areas, scheduling and supervisory control is seen as lacking established best practices.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477244.3477985;;;Systems AND Control

Preference Amplification in Recommender Systems;;;['Dimitris Kalimeris', 'Smriti Bhagat', 'Shankar Kalyanaraman', 'Udi Weinsberg'];;;August 2021;;;KDD '21: Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining;;;Recommender systems have become increasingly accurate in suggesting content to users, resulting in users primarily consuming content through recommendations. This can cause the user's interest to narrow toward the recommended content, something we refer to as preference amplification. While this can contribute to increased engagement, it can also lead to negative experiences such as lack of diversity and echo chambers. We propose a theoretical framework for studying such amplification in a matrix factorization based recommender system. We model the dynamics of the system, where users interact with the recommender systems and gradually "drift'' toward the recommended content, with the recommender system adapting, based on user feedback, to the updated preferences. We study the conditions under which preference amplification manifests, and validate our results with simulations. Finally, we evaluate mitigation strategies that prevent the adverse effects of preference amplification and present experimental results using a real-world large-scale video recommender system showing that by reducing exposure to potentially objectionable content we can increase user engagement by up to 2%.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447548.3467298;;;Systems AND Control
Robust monitoring for medical cyber-physical systems;;;['Bernd Finkbeiner', 'Andreas Keller', 'Jessica Schmidt', 'Maximilian Schwenger'];;;May 2021;;;MCPS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Medical Cyber Physical Systems and Internet of Medical Things;;;Some medical implants act autonomously: they assess the current health status of a patient and administer treatment when appropriate. An improper treatment, however, can cause serious harm. Here, the decision logic leading to the treatment relies on data obtained from sensors --- an inherently imperfect medium. Coping with these inaccuracies requires the logic to be robust in the sense that slight perturbations in the measurements do not significantly alter the decision. Determining the extent to which an algorithm is robust automatically does not scale well for complex and opaque components. This is particularly problematic when machine learning is involved. Yet, the analysis is feasible for simpler safety-related components such as a runtime monitor, which observes the system and intervenes in a treatment when necessary. Its significantly lower complexity generally allows for providing static guarantees on the runtime behavior of the monitor. Complementing these guarantees with a robustness analysis constitutes a major step toward certifiable medical cyber-physical systems controlled by opaque, machine-learned components. Hence, this paper reports on ongoing research in the direction of a robustness analysis for the runtime monitoring framework RTLola.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3446913.3460318;;;Systems AND Control

Affine-Projection-Like Maximum Correntropy Criteria Algorithm for Robust Active Noise Control;;;['Ying-Ren Chien', 'Chih-Hsiang Yu', 'Hen-Wai Tsao'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing;;;Impulse noise (IN) can seriously degrade the performance of conventional active noise control (ANC) algorithms. Here, we present a novel feedforward ANC algorithm based on an information-theoretic learning framework with the data-reuse scheme of affine-projection-based algorithms. Inspired by the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC), the proposed algorithm is referred to as the modified filtered-x affine-projection-like MCC (MFxAPLMCC). Furthermore, we developed an objective function to maximize the correntropy between the system&#x0027;s desired vectors and the secondary path&#x0027;s output vectors to enhance robustness. Moreover, linear approximation reduces computational complexity, and the optimal step size is derived mathematically to accelerate convergence and increase the noise reduction ratio. The MFxAPLMCC algorithm was thoroughly evaluated in terms of stability and computational complexity; numerical simulations were used to confirm the effectiveness in terms of average noise reduction. The efficiency of our method was verified using three types of input: (1) symmetric alpha-stable (S <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula> S) IN, (2) a mixture of sinusoidal and IN, and (3) in-vehicle engine acceleration noise. We also verified the tracking capability of the adaptive algorithm for a case in which the primary path changes abruptly. Furthermore, the real measured acoustic path for ANC in-ear headphone development was used to validate the proposed method in real environments. The proposed algorithm significantly outperformed comparative ANC algorithms in convergence rate and noise reduction ratio. We also confirmed that the theoretical bound for stable step size coincides with the numerical results. The parameter sensitivity of the MFxAPLMCC was analyzed as well.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TASLP.2022.3190720;;;Systems AND Control

This kind of dynamic analysis can be instrumental to reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and debugging. While these analyses are typically well-supported for homogeneous desktop platforms (e.g., x86 desktop PCs), they can rarely be applied in the heterogeneous world of embedded systems. One approach to enable dynamic analyses of embedded systems is to move software stacks from physical systems into virtual environments that sufficiently model hardware behavior. This process which we call "rehosting" poses a significant research challenge with major implications for security analyses. Although rehosting has traditionally been an unscientific and ad-hoc endeavor undertaken by domain experts with varying time and resources at their disposal, researchers are beginning to address rehosting challenges systematically and in earnest. In this paper, we establish that emulation is insufficient to conduct large-scale dynamic analysis of real-world hardware systems and present rehosting as a firmware-centric alternative. Furthermore, we taxonomize preliminary rehosting efforts, identify the fundamental components of the rehosting process, and propose directions for future research.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3433210.3453093;;;Systems AND Control

Once the software system is put into use, new requirements may appear, and changes of the current features may be requested by the users. Also, parts of the software may have to be modified to avoid errors found during operation, or to improve software performance, by changing functional or non-functional characteristics. After software deployment, software usually evolve in response to requests for change or in response to market competition.

Data diet pills: in-network video quality control system for traffic usage reduction;;;['Anan Sawabe', 'Takanori Iwai', 'Akihiro Nakao'];;;July 2021;;;NOSSDAV '21: Proceedings of the 31st ACM Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video;;;Traffic reduction for bandwidth-hungry video streaming services, such as YouTube, benefits not only subscribers struggling to avoid going over their contracted data limit, but also service providers when the number of people who use video streaming services increase. Because not all stakeholders who want to reduce traffic usage are willing to conduct cumbersome operations, e.g., manually setting lower resolution, we argue here that network operators should introduce a traffic pacer for providing traffic reduction services as an optional plan for subscribers. This paper proposes NetPacer, an in-network traffic pacing system for reducing traffic usage by degrading the video quality. NetPacer has two features. The first is relative pacing, which degrades the video quality relative to the initial quality by traffic shaping, thus enabling flexible quality control. The second is in-network timely video quality identification via encrypted traffic analysis by using machine learning.

Increasing the safety of software controlled complex systems, that use many distributed electronic controlled units, requires extensive testing. In model based testing, the test specification is derived from the system requirements and a model that describes selected functional and nonfunctional aspects of the system under test.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3310013.3310019;;;Systems AND Control
Revisiting Acknowledgment Mechanism for Transport Control: Modeling, Analysis, and Implementation;;;['Tong Li', 'Kai Zheng', 'Ke Xu', 'Rahul Arvind Jadhav', 'Tao Xiong', 'Keith Winstein', 'Kun Tan'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;The shared nature of the wireless medium induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgment. The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially in wireless local area network (WLAN) scenarios. In this paper, we present a new acknowledgment called TACK (&#x201C;Tame ACK&#x201D;), as well as its TCP implementation TCP-TACK. TACK seeks to minimize ACK frequency, which is exactly what is required by transport. TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification. Evaluation results show that TCP-TACK achieves significant advantages over legacy TCP in WLAN scenarios due to less contention between data packets and ACKs. Specifically, TCP-TACK reduces over 90&#x0025; of ACKs and also obtains an improvement of up to 28&#x0025; on goodput. A TACK-based protocol is a good replacement of the legacy TCP to compensate for scenarios where the acknowledgment overhead is non-negligible.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3101011;;;Systems AND Control
Variation Control and Evaluation for Generative Slate Recommendations;;;['Shuchang Liu', 'Fei Sun', 'Yingqiang Ge', 'Changhua Pei', 'Yongfeng Zhang'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;Slate recommendation generates a list of items as a whole instead of ranking each item individually, so as to better model the intra-list positional biases and item relations. In order to deal with the enormous combinatorial space of slates, recent work considers a generative solution so that a slate distribution can be directly modeled. However, we observe that such approaches—despite their proved effectiveness in computer vision—suffer from a trade-off dilemma in recommender systems: when focusing on reconstruction, they easily over-fit the data and hardly generate satisfactory recommendations; on the other hand, when focusing on satisfying the user interests, they get trapped in a few items and fail to cover the item variation in slates. In this paper, we propose to enhance the accuracy-based evaluation with slate variation metrics to estimate the stochastic behavior of generative models. We illustrate that instead of reaching to one of the two undesirable extreme cases in the dilemma, a valid generative solution resides in a narrow “elbow” region in between. And we show that item perturbation can enforce slate variation and mitigate the over-concentration of generated slates, which expand the “elbow” performance to an easy-to-find region. We further propose to separate a pivot selection phase from the generation process so that the model can apply perturbation before generation. Empirical results show that this simple modification can provide even better variance with the same level of accuracy compared to post-generation perturbation methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3449864;;;Systems AND Control
Fuzzy Controlled Adaptive Follow the Gap Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm;;;['Bilal Yucel', 'Abdurrahman Yilmaz', 'Osman Ervan', 'Hakan Temeltas'];;;November 2021;;;ICRAI '21: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence;;;Follow the Gap Method (FGM) and Improved Follow the Gap Method (FGM-I) are geometric obstacle avoidance algorithms for navigation. In these methods, the vehicle detects the gaps around the object and navigates to the midpoint of the optimal gap calculated according to a defined function. One missing point of these algorithms is failure to the goal point when there is an obstacle near to it. Another drawback is that early consideration of obstacles causes long trajectories. In this paper, Adaptive Follow the Gap (A-FGM) is presented to overcome these two points. In A-FGM, a fuzzy controlled evaluation radius is set and only obstacles within this region are included in the evaluation. A differential drive robot is used in simulations and results show that A-FGM increases the success rate of reaching the goal and efficiency of previous algorithms.

In this work, we present Sesame, a lightweight framework for edge devices which is the first to enable fine-grained access control of smart-home voice commands. Sesame, combines three components: Automatic Speech Recognition, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and a Policy module.

We investigate the interaction of these processes using a weak and then strong learning method. Results show that the weak learner leads to more body-plan diversity but that both learners cause premature convergence of body-plans to local optima.

Safety, security, and configurable software systems: a systematic mapping study;;;['Andy Kenner', 'Richard May', 'Jacob Krüger', 'Gunter Saake', 'Thomas Leich'];;;September 2021;;;SPLC '21: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference - Volume A;;;Safety and security are important properties of any software system, particularly in safety-critical domains, such as embedded, automotive, or cyber-physical systems. Moreover, particularly those domains also employ highly-configurable systems to customize variants, for example, to different customer requirements or regulations. Unfortunately, we are missing an overview understanding of what research has been conducted on the intersection of safety and security with configurable systems. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic mapping study based on an automated search, covering ten years (2011--2020) and 65 relevant (out of 367) publications. We classified each publication based on established security and safety concerns (e.g., CIA triad) as well as the connection to configurable systems (e.g., ensuring security of such a system). In the end, we found that considerably more research has been conducted on safety concerns, but both properties seem under-explored in the context of configurable systems. Moreover, existing research focuses on two directions: Ensuring safety and security properties in product-line engineering; and applying product-line techniques to ensure safety and security properties. Our mapping study provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art as well as open issues, helping practitioners identify existing solutions and researchers define directions for future research.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461001.3471147;;;Systems AND Control

The comparison includes two of the most popular platforms among users, Apple's iOS and Google's with five of the eligible participants. Google Drive is the name of the app that was developed for the Google Android platform on the Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphone and the Apple iOS platform on the iPhone Pro 11. Participants were given a scenario to complete. The scenario is broken down into three tasks that have to be completed in a specific order which is: Increase the capacity, Move, and Search. Each task's performance was evaluated using specific criteria, i.e., time taken to complete the task, total mistakes in the task, and time taken to correct a mistake. To collect user feedback, suggestions, and notes, the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire was used. According to the findings of the empirical study and the evaluation review, there were no significant usability issues in terms of efficiency on either platform. There was a discrepancy in the implementation of tasks in a task for the benefit of one of the systems and in another task for the benefit of the other system. Taking all of these disparities and results into account, as well as what was revealed by a more comprehensive analysis of the SUS survey responses, we come to the conclusion that the iOS model outperformed the Android platform.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492547.3492659;;;Systems AND Control

We formulate a model predictive control (MPC) problem for the HVAC control, of which the objective is to minimize the electricity costs and demand peak and maximize thermal comfort. A thermal equivalent circuit model (TECM) was developed to describe the target room's thermal behavior. The TECM is experimentally validated under different ambient temperatures, heat/cooling loads, and occupations. The temperature responses obtained from TECM have a good agreement with observations, and the maximum deviation is below 8%. The online management framework of the HVAC system was developed based on TECM, which includes a monitoring system based on HVAC built-in sensor and embedded technology and a real-time HVAC system control module based on the MPC problem. The performance of the proposed framework with different operating conditions was investigated in the actual room. The results show that the HVAC systems using this framework can achieve better room temperature control and a further improvement in energy efficiency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470481.3472710;;;Systems AND Control

In this paper, we target all stages of cooperative lifting in a holistic approach and extend previous results in [1] using IMU-based human motions estimates by introducing force-based control. We demonstrate through experiments on a UR5e robot how the force-based approach significantly improves on the position-based approach of [1]. Additionally, we improve the real-time control capabilities of the system by using a real-time data exchange communication interface. We believe that our system can be an advancing point for more human motion/gesture-based HRI applications as well as increasing the uptake of human-robot co-lifting systems in industrial settings.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3523760.3523856;;;Systems AND Control
System-of-Systems Reliability: An Exploratory Study in a Brazilian Public Organization;;;['Marcio Imamura', 'Francisco Henrique Ferreira', 'Juliana Costa Fernandes', 'Rodrigo Santos'];;;June 2021;;;SBSI '21: Proceedings of the XVII Brazilian Symposium on Information Systems;;;A System-of-systems (SoS) is defined as an arrangement of independent systems that work together to accomplish missions that could not be achieved by a single system in isolation. SoS can be observed in several domains, including mobility, healthcare, and safety. A significant concern of SoS engineers refers to the constituent systems’ independence since they may change the level of contribution or abandon the SoS, decreasing the overall reliability. In this paper, we performed a study of an SoS running in a Brazilian public organization focusing on identifying reliability issues. To do so, we first characterized the SoS by identifying the missions, constituent systems, relationships, and capabilities. We further conducted a focus group and a survey with the SoS engineering team to identify situations that decrease SoS reliability and how they can be treated. Both the focus group and the survey helped us to propose an initial mKAOS extension for the representation of reliability issues, such as failures and fault tolerance mechanisms in SoS. We believe that our extension can facilitate the communication of SoS reliability issues, considering the existing challenges.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466933.3466954;;;Systems AND Control

Towards Achieving the 2030 Vision, the Case study of Automating the Food Production Services during the Hajj Season and Quality Control Using the Blockchain Technology;;;['Dhefaf Radain', 'Saliha Almalki', 'Shatha A. Almarghalani', 'Salma Elhag'];;;December 2021;;;ICFNDS 2021: The 5th International Conference on Future Networks &amp; Distributed Systems;;;Improving the services provided for the pilgrims is one of the Saudi Arabian government priorities, as well as for each person who works in the agencies of serving them. Food providing is considered one of the main services for the pilgrims. The current food service providers are 3-4 food plants that do not cover the whole number of the needed meals, kitchens, and the local market. In the current situation, the meals are provided under no specific standards or regulations, and the quality assurance process needs to work with several providers. In this paper, we propose a solution for this problem by suggesting the automation of the whole food providing services by establishing several centralized and specialized food plants that work under a single authority, distributed widely to cover a large area of the pilgrims' locations. The plants will be responsible for the food service starting from providing the raw materials up to the delivery of the meals to the performers on time without any compromise in its quality. This is done by applying blockchain technology as a proposed method for quality control on the supply chain to record every transaction and verify the origin of every material used to produce the meals, as well as trace back the source of any problem to its origin. This will ensure the availability of the total number of required meals in time, the meals to be produced under specific standards and specifications, and will digitize the quality assurance process and make it more centralized. The result of simulating the proposed "to-be" business model by using the Bizagi platform showed that the proposed model outperformed the current "as-is" model by saving 54.46% of the needed total needed time for food providing service. It also showed promising results regarding quality when applying blockchain technology.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508072.3508096;;;Systems AND Control
MsEmoTTS: Multi-Scale Emotion Transfer, Prediction, and Control for Emotional Speech Synthesis;;;['Yi Lei', 'Shan Yang', 'Xinsheng Wang', 'Lei Xie'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing;;;Expressive synthetic speech is essential for many human-computer interaction and audio broadcast scenarios, and thus synthesizing expressive speech has attracted much attention in recent years. Previous methods performed the expressive speech synthesis either with explicit labels or with a fixed-length style embedding extracted from reference audio, both of which can only learn an average style and thus ignores the multi-scale nature of speech prosody. In this paper, we propose MsEmoTTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis framework, to model the emotion from different levels. Specifically, the proposed method is a typical attention-based sequence-to-sequence model and with proposed three modules, including global-level emotion presenting module (GM), utterance-level emotion presenting module (UM), and local-level emotion presenting module (LM), to model the global emotion category, utterance-level emotion variation, and syllable-level emotion strength, respectively. In addition to modeling the emotion from different levels, the proposed method also allows us to synthesize emotional speech in different ways, i.e., transferring the emotion from reference audio, predicting the emotion from input text, and controlling the emotion strength manually. Extensive experiments conducted on a Chinese emotional speech corpus demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared reference audio-based and text-based emotional speech synthesis methods on the emotion transfer speech synthesis and text-based emotion prediction speech synthesis respectively. Besides, the experiments also show that the proposed method can control the emotion expressions flexibly. Detailed analysis shows the effectiveness of each module and the good design of the proposed method.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TASLP.2022.3145293;;;Systems AND Control

Polymorphic Iterable Sequential Effect Systems;;;['Colin S. Gordon'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems;;;Effect systems are lightweight extensions to type systems that can verify a wide range of important properties with modest developer burden. But our general understanding of effect systems is limited primarily to systems where the order of effects is irrelevant. Understanding such systems in terms of a semilattice of effects grounds understanding of the essential issues and provides guidance when designing new effect systems. By contrast, sequential effect systems—where the order of effects is important—lack an established algebraic structure on effects.We present an abstract polymorphic effect system parameterized by an effect quantale—an algebraic structure with well-defined properties that can model the effects of a range of existing sequential effect systems. We define effect quantales, derive useful properties, and show how they cleanly model a variety of known sequential effect systems.We show that for most effect quantales, there is an induced notion of iterating a sequential effect; that for systems we consider the derived iteration agrees with the manually designed iteration operators in prior work; and that this induced notion of iteration is as precise as possible when defined. We also position effect quantales with respect to work on categorical semantics for sequential effect systems, clarifying the distinctions between these systems and our own in the course of giving a thorough survey of these frameworks. Our derived iteration construct should generalize to these semantic structures, addressing limitations of that work. Finally, we consider the relationship between sequential effects and Kleene Algebras, where the latter may be used as instances of the former.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450272;;;Systems AND Control
Caracal: Contention Management with Deterministic Concurrency Control;;;['Dai Qin', 'Angela Demke Brown', 'Ashvin Goel'];;;October 2021;;;SOSP '21: Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 28th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles;;;Deterministic databases offer several benefits: they ensure serializable execution while avoiding concurrency-control related aborts, and they scale well in distributed environments. Today, most deterministic database designs use partitioning to scale up and avoid contention. However, partitioning requires significant programmer effort, leads to poor performance under skewed workloads, and incurs unnecessary overheads in certain uncontended workloads. We present the design of Caracal, a novel shared-memory, deterministic database that performs well under both skew and contention. Our deterministic scheme batches transactions in epochs and executes the transactions in an epoch in a predetermined order. Our scheme enables reducing contention by batching concurrency control operations. It also allows analyzing the transactions in the epoch to determine contended keys accurately. Certain transactions can then be split into independent contended and uncontended pieces and run deterministically and in parallel, further reducing contention. Based on these ideas, we present two novel optimizations, batch append and split-on-demand, for managing contention. With these optimizations, Caracal scales well and outperforms existing deterministic schemes in most workloads by 1.9x to 9.7x.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483591;;;Systems AND Control

Hybrid Variational Autoencoder for Recommender Systems;;;['Hangbin Zhang', 'Raymond K. Wong', 'Victor W.

Some hybrid models have been proposed recently to address the deficiency of existing models. However, their performances drop significantly when the dataset is sparse. Most of the recent works failed to fully address this shortcoming. At most, some of them only tried to alleviate the problem by considering either user side or item side content information. In this article, we propose a novel recommender model called Hybrid Variational Autoencoder (HVAE) to improve the performance on sparse datasets. Different from the existing approaches, we encode both user and item information into a latent space for semantic relevance measurement. In parallel, we utilize collaborative filtering to find the implicit factors of users and items, and combine their outputs to deliver a hybrid solution. In addition, we compare the performance of Gaussian distribution and multinomial distribution in learning the representations of the textual data. Our experiment results show that HVAE is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art models with robust performance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470659;;;Systems AND Control

In response to the environmental changes, the companies have been adopting various practices to survive in business. Most companies abandon their CSR activities to emphasize efficiency by reason of the companies’ survival without considering social and environmental interests.

Values of User Exploration in Recommender Systems;;;['Minmin Chen', 'Yuyan Wang', 'Can Xu', 'Ya Le', 'Mohit Sharma', 'Lee Richardson', 'Su-Lin Wu', 'Ed Chi'];;;September 2021;;;RecSys '21: Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems;;;Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been sought after to bring next-generation recommender systems to further improve user experience on recommendation platforms. While the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is the foundation of RL research, the value of exploration in (RL-based) recommender systems is less well understood. Exploration, commonly seen as a tool to reduce model uncertainty in regions of sparse user interaction/feedback, is believed to cost user experience in the short term, while the indirect benefit of better model quality arrives at a later time. We focus on another aspect of exploration, which we refer to as user exploration to help discover new user interests, and argue it can improve user experience even in the more imminent term. We examine the role of user exploration in changing different facets of recommendation quality that more directly impact user experience. To do so, we introduce a series of methods inspired by exploration research in RL to increase user exploration in an RL-based recommender system, and study their effect on the end recommendation quality, more specifically, on accuracy, diversity, novelty and serendipity. We propose a set of metrics to measure (RL based) recommender systems in these four aspects and evaluate the impact of exploration-induced methods against these metrics. In addition to the offline measurements, we conduct live experiments on an industrial recommendation platform serving billions of users to showcase the benefit of user exploration. Moreover, we use conversion of casual users to core users as an indicator of the holistic long-term user experience and study the values of user exploration in helping platforms convert users. Through offline analyses and live experiments, we study the correlation between these four facets of recommendation quality and long term user experience, and connect serendipity to improved long term user experience.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460231.3474236;;;Systems AND Control

Optimal control strategy of three level STATCOM in weak power grid;;;['Yang Zhang', 'Shaojia Feng', 'Xiaopin Yang', 'Wentao Xia', 'Tian Gao', 'Xiao Wang', 'Changxue Li'];;;October 2021;;;EITCE '21: Proceedings of the 2021 5th International Conference on Electronic Information Technology and Computer Engineering;;;The line distance under weak power grid is long, the system capacity is large, and the grid impedance increases when the grid operation state changes, which leads to the instability and even shutdown of STATCOM. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal control strategy for neutral point clamped (NPC) three-level STATCOM with fast response to line impedance. On the one hand, through the establishment of the mathematical model of the system, the operating characteristics of the system are analyzed; On the other hand, by introducing the disturbance term of PLL with line impedance, a system model suitable for weak power grid is established to study the influence of line impedance on the system, and a filter differential controller is used to quickly respond to line impedance to improve the robustness of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by simulation and experiment.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3501409.3501669;;;Systems AND Control
Robust Adversarial Attacks Against DNN-Based Wireless Communication Systems;;;['Alireza Bahramali', 'Milad Nasr', 'Amir Houmansadr', 'Dennis Goeckel', 'Don Towsley'];;;November 2021;;;CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;There is significant enthusiasm for the employment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for important tasks in major wireless communication systems: channel estimation and decoding in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, end-to-end autoencoder system design, radio signal classification, and signal authentication. Unfortunately, DNNs can be susceptible to adversarial examples, potentially making such wireless systems fragile and vulnerable to attack. In this work, by designing robust adversarial examples that meet key criteria, we perform a comprehensive study of the threats facing DNN-based wireless systems. We model the problem of adversarial wireless perturbations as an optimization problem that incorporates domain constraints specific to different wireless systems. This allows us to generate wireless adversarial perturbations that can be applied to wireless signals on-the-fly (i.e., with no need to know the target signals a priori), are undetectable from natural wireless noise, and are robust against removal. We show that even in the presence of significant defense mechanisms deployed by the communicating parties, our attack performs significantly better compared to existing attacks against DNN-based wireless systems. In particular, the results demonstrate that even when employing well-considered defenses, DNN-based wireless communication systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and call into question the employment of DNNs for a number of tasks in robust wireless communication.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484777;;;Systems AND Control
Novel Reconfigurable Hardware Systems for Tumor Growth Prediction;;;['Konstantinos Malavazos', 'Maria Papadogiorgaki', 'Pavlos Malakonakis', 'Ioannis Papaefstathiou'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Computing for Healthcare;;;An emerging trend in biomedical systems research is the development of models that take full advantage of the increasing available computational power to manage and analyze new biological data as well as to model complex biological processes. Such biomedical models require significant computational resources, since they process and analyze large amounts of data, such as medical image sequences. We present a family of advanced computational models for the prediction of the spatio-temporal evolution of glioma and their novel implementation in state-of-the-art FPGA devices. Glioma is a rapidly evolving type of brain cancer, well known for its aggressive and diffusive behavior. The developed system simulates the glioma tumor growth in the brain tissue, which consists of different anatomic structures, by utilizing MRI slices. The presented models have been proved highly accurate in predicting the growth of the tumor, whereas the developed innovative hardware system, when implemented on a low-end, low-cost FPGA, is up to 85% faster than a high-end server consisting of 20 physical cores (and 40 virtual ones) and more than 28× more energy-efficient than it; the energy efficiency grows up to 50× and the speedup up to 14× if the presented designs are implemented in a high-end FPGA. Moreover, the proposed reconfigurable system, when implemented in a large FPGA, is significantly faster than a high-end GPU (i.e., from 80% and up to 250% faster), for the majority of the models, while it is also significantly better (i.e., from 80% to over 1,600%) in terms of power efficiency, for all the implemented models.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3454126;;;Systems AND Control
Building verified neural networks with specifications for systems;;;['Cheng Tan', 'Yibo Zhu', 'Chuanxiong Guo'];;;August 2021;;;APSys '21: Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGOPS Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems;;;Neural networks (NNs) are beneficial to many services, and we believe systems—such as OSes, databases, networked systems—are not an exception. But applying NNs in these critical systems is challenging: people have to risk getting unexpected outcomes from NNs because NN behaviors are not well-defined. To tame these undefined behaviors, we introduce a framework ouroboros, which builds verified NNs that follow user-defined specifications. These specifications comprise input and output constraints which characterize the behaviors of a NN. We do a case study on database learned indexes to demonstrate that training verified NN models is possible. Though many challenges remain, ouroboros enables us, for the first time, to apply NNs in critical systems with _confidence_.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3476886.3477508;;;Systems AND Control

A popular approach to this challenge is through the incorporation of norms that regulate behaviour in an ethical way. However, such norms must be effective at promoting the values we consider most important. In this work, we introduce a systematic methodology for the automated synthesis of parametric normative systems based on value promotion. We introduce the new concepts of Shapley values of norms and value compatibility. To quantify the effectiveness of norms at upholding the values we consider relevant, we adopt the value alignment indicator from a previously established framework. We apply our model to a toy system which we use to illustrate our approach from end to end.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464060;;;Systems AND Control

Information Hiding in Cyber Physical Systems: Challenges for Embedding, Retrieval and Detection using Sensor Data of the SWAT Dataset;;;['Kevin Lamshöft', 'Tom Neubert', 'Christian Krätzer', 'Claus Vielhauer', 'Jana Dittmann'];;;June 2021;;;IH&amp;MMSec '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security;;;In this paper, we present an Information Hiding approach that would be suitable for exfiltrating sensible information of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) by leveraging the long-term storage of process data in historian databases. We show how hidden messages can be embedded in sensor measurements as well as retrieved asynchronously by accessing the historian. We evaluate this approach at the example of water-flow and water-level sensors of the Secure Water Treatment (SWAT) dataset from iTrust. To generalize from specific cover channels (sensors and their transmitted data), we reflect upon general challenges that arise in such Information Hiding scenarios creating network covert channels and discuss aspects of cover channel selection and and sender receiver synchronisation as well as temporal aspects such as the potential persistence of hidden messages in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). For an empirical evaluation we design and implement a covert channel that makes use of different embedding strategies to perform an adaptive approach in regards to the noise in sensor measurements, resulting in dynamic capacity and bandwidth selection to reduce detection probability. The results of this evaluation show that, using such methods, the exfiltration of sensible information in long-term scaled attacks would indeed be possible. Additionally, we present two detection approaches for the introduced hidden channel and carry out an extensive evaluation of our detectors with multiple test data sets and different parameters. We determine a detection accuracy of up to 87.8% on test data at a false positive rate (FPR) of 0%.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437880.3460413;;;Systems AND Control
Categorical Semantics of Cyber-Physical Systems Theory;;;['Georgios Bakirtzis', 'Cody H. Fleming', 'Christina Vasilakopoulou'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Cyber-physical systems require the construction and management of various models to assure their correct, safe, and secure operation. These various models are necessary because of the coupled physical and computational dynamics present in cyber-physical systems. However, to date the different model views of cyber-physical systems are largely related informally, which raises issues with the degree of formal consistency between those various models of requirements, system behavior, and system architecture. We present a category-theoretic framework to make different types of composition explicit in the modeling and analysis of cyber-physical systems, which could assist in verifying the system as a whole. This compositional framework for cyber-physical systems gives rise to unified system models, where system behavior is hierarchically decomposed and related to a system architecture using the systems-as-algebras paradigm. As part of this paradigm, we show that an algebra of (safety) contracts generalizes over the state of the art, providing more uniform mathematical tools for constraining the behavior over a richer set of composite cyber-physical system models, which has the potential of minimizing or eliminating hazardous behavior.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461669;;;Systems AND Control

In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs that usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users’ clicks on items), and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research. Finally, we discuss new research opportunities in this exciting and vibrant area.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465401;;;Systems AND Control

Fighting Fires and Powering Steam Locomotives: Distribution of Control and Its Role in Social Interaction at Tangible Interactive Museum Exhibits;;;['Loraine Clarke', 'Eva Hornecker', 'Ian Ruthven'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;We present a video-analysis study of museum visitors’ interactions at two tangible interactive exhibits in a transport museum. Our focus is on groups’ social and shared interactions, in particular how exhibit setup and structure influence collaboration patterns. Behaviors at the exhibits included individuals focusing beyond their personal activity towards companions’ interaction, adults participating via physical interaction, and visitors taking opportunities to interact when companions moved between sections of the exhibit or stepped back from interaction. We demonstrate how exhibits’ physical configuration and interactive control engendered behavioral patterns. Systematic analysis reveals how different configurations (concerning physical-spatial hardware and interactive software) distribute control differently amongst visitors. We present four mechanisms for how control can be distributed at an interactive installation: functional, temporal, physical and indirect verbal. In summary, our work explores how mechanisms that distribute control influence patterns of shared interaction with the exhibits and social interaction between museum visitor companions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445534;;;Systems AND Control
The Application of the Blockchain Technology in Voting Systems: A Review;;;['Jun Huang', 'Debiao He', 'Mohammad S.

However, conventional voting systems tend to be centralized, which are known to suffer from security and efficiency limitations. Hence, there has been a trend of moving to decentralized voting systems, such as those based on blockchain. The latter is a decentralized digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network, where a copy of the append-only ledger of digitally signed and encrypted transactions is maintained by each participant. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of blockchain-based voting systems and classify them based on a number of features (e.g., the types of blockchain used, the consensus approaches used, and the scale of participants). By systematically analyzing and comparing the different blockchain-based voting systems, we also identify a number of limitations and research opportunities.

EXOSMOOTH: Test of Innovative EXOskeleton Control for SMOOTH Assistance, With and Without Ankle Actuation;;;['Vittorio Lippi', 'Alessandro Filippeschi', 'Cristian Camardella', 'Francesco Porcini', 'Christoph Maurer', 'Lucia Lencioni'];;;March 2022;;;HRI '22: Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction;;;This work presents a description of the EXOSMOOTH project, oriented to the benchmarking of lower limb exoskeletons performance. In the field of assisted walking by powered lower limb exoskeletons, the EXOSMOOTH project proposes an experiment that targets two scientific questions. The first question is related to the effectiveness of a novel control strategy for smooth assistance. Current assist strategies are based on controllers that switch the assistance level based on the gait segmentation provided by a finite state machine. The proposed strategy aims at managing phase transitions to provide a smoother assistance to the user, thus increasing the device transparency and comfort for the user. The second question is the role of the actuation at the ankle joint in assisted walking. Many novel exoskeletons devised for industrial applications do not feature an actuated ankle joint. In the EXOSMOOTH project, the ankle joint actuation will be one experimental factor to have a direct assessment of the role of an actuated joint in assisted walking. Preliminary results of 15 healthy subjects walking at different speeds while wearing a lower limb exoskeleton supported the rationale behind this question: having an actuated ankle joint could potentially reduce the torques applied by the user by a maximum value of 85 Nm. The two aforementioned questions will be investigated in a protocol that includes walking on a treadmill and on flat ground, with or without slope, and with a load applied on the back. In addition, the interaction forces measured at the exoskeleton harnesses will be used to assess the comfort of the user and the effectiveness of the control strategy to improve transparency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3523760.3523899;;;Systems AND Control
Efficient data validation for geographical interlocking systems;;;['Jan Peleska', 'Niklas Krafczyk', 'Anne E. Haxthausen', 'Ralf Pinger'];;;None;;;Formal Aspects of Computing;;;AbstractIn this paper, an efficient approach to data validation of
distributed geographical interlocking systems (IXLs) is presented.
In the distributed IXL paradigm, track elements are controlled by
local computers communicating with other control components over
local and wide area networks. The overall control logic is
distributed over these track-side computers and remote server
computers that may even reside in one or more cloud server farms.
Redundancy is introduced to ensure fail-safe behaviour,
fault-tolerance, and to increase the availability of the overall
system. To cope with the configuration-related complexity of such
distributed IXLs, the software is designed according to the digital
twin paradigm: physical track elements are associated with software
objects implementing supervision and control for the element. The
objects communicate with each other and with high-level IXL control
components in the cloud over logical channels realised by
distributed communication mechanisms. The objective of this article
is to explain  how configuration rules for this type of IXLs can be
specified by temporal logic formulae interpreted on Kripke Structure
representations of the IXL configuration. Violations of
configuration rules can be specified using formulae from a
well-defined subset of LTL. By decomposing the complete
configuration model into sub-models corresponding to routes
through the model, the LTL model checking problem can be transformed
into a CTL checking problem for which highly efficient algorithms
exist. Specialised rule violation queries that are hard to express
in LTL can be simplified and checked faster by performing sub-model
transformations adding auxiliary variables to the states of the
underlying Kripke Structures. Further performance enhancements are
achieved by checking each sub-model concurrently. The approach
presented here has been implemented in a model checking tool which
is applied by Siemens Mobility for data validation of geographical
IXLs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00165-021-00551-6;;;Systems AND Control

Therefore, we have analyzed the feasibility of transparently using PROFINET over TSN via a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplex (DWDM) link, where a machine park is controlled remotely by an Edge-based virtual Programmable Logic Controller (vPLC). As a result, we are able to setup a TSN connection over a MAN with a one-way delay of about 156.5 μs and a jitter of about 12 ns.

Applying the control circuit, full-adder can be switched between reading and writing mode, MTJ can be written in reliably, and the normal function of full adder will not be affected. Simulation results show that, under the control of the circuit, writing to MTJ can be achieved effectively while the function of full adder can be realized. Compared with traditional device, applying MTJ can greatly reduce system power consumption without writing.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3475971.3475976;;;Systems AND Control
A Multi-core LC-based Digitally Controlled Oscillator in 55 nm CMOS;;;['Yan Yao', 'Zhiqun Li'];;;April 2021;;;ICECC '21: Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control Engineering;;;This paper presents a three-core LC-based digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) in 55 nm CMOS technology for wideband all-digital phased-locked loop (ADPLL) system. Various techniques are employed to ease the trade-off between tuning range, frequency resolution and linearity. Multi cores and multi-stage improved capacitor arrays are implemented to achieve an ultra-wideband tuning range of 91%. Capacitor division technology is employed for high frequency resolution and carefully symmetrical layout arrangement is applied for linear frequency tuning. This DCO oscillates over a 2.7-7.2 GHz frequency range with a fine frequency resolution of 3.2-14.2 kHz. The DCO exhibits a phase noise of -128.7 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset from 4.95 GHz carrier. The total area of the DCO is 1.35×1.08 mm2, with a total current consumption of 25 mA from a 2.5 V supply voltage. The simulation results show that the proposed DCO exhibits comparable good tuning range, resolution and phase noise performances, and is suitable for wideband ADPLL application.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462676.3462688;;;Systems AND Control
Lazy parameter tuning and control: choosing all parameters randomly from a power-law distribution;;;['Denis Antipov', 'Maxim Buzdalov', 'Benjamin Doerr'];;;June 2021;;;GECCO '21: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference;;;Most evolutionary algorithms have multiple parameters and their values drastically affect the performance. Due to the often complicated interplay of the parameters, setting these values right for a particular problem is a challenging task. This task becomes even more complicated when the optimal parameter values change significantly during the run of the algorithm since then a dynamic parameter choice is necessary. In this work, we propose a lazy but effective solution, namely choosing all parameter values in each iteration randomly from a suitably scaled power-law distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach via runtime analyses of the (1 + (λ, λ)) genetic algorithm with all three parameters chosen in this manner. We show that this algorithm on the one hand can imitate simple hill-climbers like the (1+1) EA, giving the same asymptotic runtime on some simple problems. On the other hand, this algorithm is also very efficient on jump functions, where the best static parameters are very different from those necessary to optimize simple problems. We prove a performance guarantee that is comparable to, and sometimes even better than, the best performance known for static parameters. We complement our theoretical results with a rigorous empirical study confirming what the asymptotic runtime results suggest.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449639.3459377;;;Systems AND Control
Delay-Based Network Utility Maximization Modelling for Congestion Control in Named Data Networking;;;['Yuhang Ye', 'Brian Lee', 'Ronan Flynn', 'Jin Xu', 'Guiming Fang', 'Yuansong Qiao'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;Content replication and name-based routing lead to a natural multi-source and multipath transmission paradigm in NDN. Due to the unique connectionless characteristic of NDN, current end-to-end multipath congestion control schemes (e.g. MPTCP) cannot be used directly on NDN. This paper proposes a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) model to formulate multi-source and multipath transmission in NDN with in-network caches. From this model, a family of receiver-driven transmission solutions can be derived, named as path-specified congestion control. The path-specified congestion control enables content consumers to separate the traffic control on each path, which consequently facilitates fair and efficient bandwidth sharing amongst all consumers. As a specific instance, a Delay-based Path-specified Congestion Control Protocol (DPCCP) is presented, which utilizes queuing delays as signals to measure and control congestion levels of different bottlenecks. In addition, a set of high-performance congestion control laws are designed to accelerate bandwidth and fairness convergence towards the optimum defined by the NUM model. Finally, DPCCP is compared with state-of-the-art solutions. The experimental evaluations show that DPCCP outperforms existing solutions in terms of bandwidth utilization, convergence time and packet loss.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3090174;;;Systems AND Control

Astrocytic control in in vitro and simulated neuron-astrocyte networks;;;['Barbara Genocchi', 'Annika Ahtiainen', 'Michael T. Barros', 'Jarno M.A. Tanskanen', 'Jari Hyttinen', 'Kerstin Lenk'];;;September 2021;;;NANOCOM '21: Proceedings of the Eight Annual ACM International Conference on Nanoscale Computing and Communication;;;Astrocytes are involved in the information propagation in the brain by interacting with neurons. Computational modeling helps to study the underlying mechanisms for this communication deeply. In this work, we aimed to analyze how the number of astrocytes and the resulting astrocytic network structure affects neuronal activity. Therefore, we conducted in vitro experiments with microelectrode arrays and simulations with our previously published computational neuron-astrocyte network model side-by-side. In those, we included neuronal cultures without supplemented astrocytes and three conditions with co-cultures where different amounts of astrocytes were added. We then conducted a cross-correlation analysis between the single-channel spike trains and a graph analysis, which included the mean degree, mean shortest path, and the number of nodes, based on the highly correlated channels. Furthermore, we combined the cross-correlation network analysis of the simulated data and the structure of the astrocyte topology. Our experimental results showed that the spike rate was very variable and higher in cultures without added astrocytes than overall in co-cultures. In the co-cultures, the activity was elevated with an increasing number of astrocytes. Additionally, the spike rate was correlated with the mean degree of the neuronal network. This correlation was smaller with larger numbers of astrocytes in the culture. The simulations showed that the most active neurons were localized in the center of the network, which were, however, not always the most connected ones. The astrocytic activation was mainly driven by the vicinity to highly active neurons rather than from the activation through gap junctions. To conclude, the co-cultures with added astrocytes showed stabilization of neuronal activity. Furthermore, increasing the number of astrocytes led to a higher neuronal activity, indicating a feedback excitation loop between astrocytes and neurons.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477206.3477458;;;Systems AND Control

Simulation-based testbeds are useful tools for engineering those cyber-physical systems and evaluating their efficiency, security, and resilience. In this article, we present a cyber-physical system testing platform combining distributed physical computing and networking hardware and simulation models. A core component is the distributed virtual time system that enables the efficient synchronization of virtual clocks among distributed embedded Linux devices. Virtual clocks also enable high-fidelity experimentation by interrupting real and emulated cyber-physical applications to inject offline simulation data. We design and implement two modes of the distributed virtual time: periodic mode for scheduling repetitive events like sensor device measurements, and dynamic mode for on-demand interrupt-based synchronization. We also analyze the performance of both approaches to synchronization including overhead, accuracy, and error introduced from each approach. By interconnecting the embedded devices’ general purpose IO pins, they can coordinate and synchronize with low overhead, under 50 microseconds for eight processes across four embedded Linux devices. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of our testbed and the differences between both approaches in a power grid control application.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3446237;;;Systems AND Control

Systemizing Interprocedural Static Analysis of Large-scale Systems Code with Graspan;;;['Zhiqiang Zuo', 'Kai Wang', 'Aftab Hussain', 'Ardalan Amiri Sani', 'Yiyu Zhang', 'Shenming Lu', 'Wensheng Dou', 'Linzhang Wang', 'Xuandong Li', 'Chenxi Wang', 'Guoqing Harry Xu'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Computer Systems;;;There is more than a decade-long history of using static analysis to find bugs in systems such as Linux. Most of the existing static analyses developed for these systems are simple checkers that find bugs based on pattern matching. Despite the presence of many sophisticated interprocedural analyses, few of them have been employed to improve checkers for systems code due to their complex implementations and poor scalability.In this article, we revisit the scalability problem of interprocedural static analysis from a “Big Data” perspective. That is, we turn sophisticated code analysis into Big Data analytics and leverage novel data processing techniques to solve this traditional programming language problem. We propose Graspan, a disk-based parallel graph system that uses an edge-pair centric computation model to compute dynamic transitive closures on very large program graphs. We develop two backends for Graspan, namely, Graspan-C running on CPUs and Graspan-G on GPUs, and present their designs in the article. Graspan-C can analyze large-scale systems code on any commodity PC, while, if GPUs are available, Graspan-G can be readily used to achieve orders of magnitude speedup by harnessing a GPU’s massive parallelism.We have implemented fully context-sensitive pointer/alias and dataflow analyses on Graspan. An evaluation of these analyses on large codebases written in multiple languages such as Linux and Apache Hadoop demonstrates that their Graspan implementations are language-independent, scale to millions of lines of code, and are much simpler than their original implementations. Moreover, we show that these analyses can be used to uncover many real-world bugs in large-scale systems code.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466820;;;Systems AND Control

The audit report recommends requiring "all AM systems to obtain an authority to operate in accordance with DoD policy before their use" [1], and requiring "AM system owners to immediately identify and implement security controls to minimize risk until obtaining an authority to operate." [1] The DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) responded that existing DoD regulations require both of these for "all IT systems, including AM systems" [1]. Such cyber security rules can help guard against vulnerabilities such as design file theft or digital thread hacking, as well as unauthorized prints on AM systems that can impact the safety and integrity of parts used in defense systems, expose critical intellectual property to bad actors and even cause manufacturing facilities to shut down. To improve AM system vendors' understanding of these cybersecurity requirements for DoD and the US Government (USG), we discuss in this paper the process for obtaining an Authority To Operate (ATO) certification for an IT system per DoD and USG cybersecurity regulations, i.e., the Risk Management Framework (RMF) process from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [2].

Timely and accurate detection of model deviation in self-adaptive software-intensive systems;;;['Yanxiang Tong', 'Yi Qin', 'Yanyan Jiang', 'Chang Xu', 'Chun Cao', 'Xiaoxing Ma'];;;August 2021;;;ESEC/FSE 2021: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering;;;Control-based approaches to self-adaptive software-intensive systems (SASs) are hailed for their optimal performance and theoretical guarantees on the reliability of adaptation behavior. However, in practice the guarantees are often threatened by model deviations occurred at runtime. In this paper, we propose a Model-guided Deviation Detector (MoD2) for timely and accurate detection of model deviations. To ensure reliability, a SAS can switch a control-based optimal controller for a mandatory controller once an unsafe model deviation is detected. MoD2 achieves both high timeliness and high accuracy through a deliberate fusion of parameter deviation estimation, uncertainty compensation, and safe region quantification. Empirical evaluation with three exemplar systems validated the efficacy of MoD2 (93.3% shorter detection delay, 39.4% lower FN rate, and 25.2% lower FP rate), as well as the benefits of the adaptation-switching mechanism (abnormal rate dropped by 29.2%).;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468264.3468548;;;Systems AND Control

COIN: An Efficient Indexing Mechanism for Unstructured Data Sharing Systems;;;['Junjie Xie', 'Chen Qian', 'Deke Guo', 'Minmei Wang', 'Ge Wang', 'Honghui Chen'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;Edge computing promises a dramatic reduction in the network latency and the traffic volume, where many edge servers are placed at the edge of the Internet. Furthermore, those edge servers cache data to provide services for edge users. The data sharing among those edge servers can effectively shorten the latency to retrieve the data and further reduce the network bandwidth consumption. The key challenge is to construct an efficient data indexing mechanism no matter how the data is cached in the edge network. Although this is essential, it is still an open problem. Moreover, existing methods such as the centralized indexing and the DHT indexing in other fields fail to meet the performance demand of edge computing. This paper presents a COordinate-based INdexing (COIN) mechanism for the data sharing in edge computing. COIN maintains a virtual space where switches and data indexes are associated with their coordinates. Then, COIN distributes data indexes to indexing edge servers based on those coordinates. The COIN is effective because any query request from an edge server can be responded when the data has been stored in the edge network. More importantly, COIN is efficient in both routing path lengths and forwarding table sizes for publishing/querying data indexes. We implement COIN in a P4 prototype. Experimental results show that COIN uses 59&#x0025; shorter path length and 30&#x0025; less forwarding table entries to retrieve data indexes compared to using Chord, a well-known DHT solution.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3110782;;;Systems AND Control

Manipulating Extracellular Matrix Organizations and Parameters to Control Local Cancer Invasion;;;['Antara Pal', 'Pegi Haliti', 'Bhushan Dharmadhikari', 'Wu Qi', 'Prabir Patra'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics;;;Metastasis contributes to over 90 percent of cancer mortalities and may be influenced by the extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM microenvironments differ in matrix organization, cell-matrix adhesions, and fiber rigidity, which may affect cancer migration and, thus, should be investigated. To understand the interactions between cancer cells and the ECM, we simulate local invasion through ECM organizations of varying determinants. Randomly curved organizations of normal ovarian stroma exhibit minimal local invasion. In contrast, wave-like and parallel linear structures in reorganized ECM organizations provide contact guidance, which increases cancer invasiveness. ECM organizations with strong cell-matrix attachments generate cell pseudopodia, which aid in increasing invasion rate, while weaker attachments prevent the cells from attaching to the fibers and forming pseudopodia, limiting local invasion. ECM organizations with rigid fibers elongate the cell body, allowing them to form cell protrusions and spread rapidly. Conversely, soft fibers stimulate cell rounding and limit migration. Optimizing cell-matrix adhesions and fiber rigidity results in below 10 percent local invasion and reinforces the importance of using computational modeling to discover novel approaches to restricting cancer movement.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TCBB.2020.2989223;;;Systems AND Control

Kadiyala', 'Praveen Tammana', 'Saurabh Joshi'];;;August 2021;;;SPIN '21: Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Workshop on Secure Programmable network INfrastructure;;;Programmable data planes provide exciting opportunities to realize fast, accurate, and data-driven control-loop decisions. Many data plane systems have been proposed for handling network dynamics (e.g., congestion, failures) in near real-time. The core of these systems has packet-processing data-plane algorithms that continuously monitor traffic and respond automatically. Despite their benefits, automatic response to network events lead to increase in potential sources of inputs, and hence, increase in attack surface. This paper takes a step towards securing such systems by (1) identifying possible attacks on recently proposed data-driven data-plane systems; and (2) designing a scalable tool for detecting such attacks at run time. Our approach models plausible expected behavior and uses the model as a reference to check whether the system is under attack. We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of our detection methodology.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472873.3472880;;;Systems AND Control
Active Disturbance Rejection Control for the Synchronizer Engagement with a Proportional Pressure Reducing Valve;;;['Lixiang Ye', 'Jinle Zhang', 'Wei Wu', 'Bingqing Xiao'];;;March 2022;;;ICSRT '22: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Service Robotics Technologies;;;Synchronizer as an important part of mechanical transmission, it has an important impact on gear shift performance. How to reduce shift impact and ensure shift smoothness is an important goal of synchronizer. This paper presents a novel synchronizer shift actuator controlled by proportional reducing valve, which can ensure the smoothness of shift, and the generated back pressure can effectively reduce the shift impact. In order to reduce the shift impact and complete the fast shift at the same time, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is applied, which can estimate and compensate the uncertainty of the system in real time, and improve the anti-interference ability and adaptive ability of the gear actuator. A simulation and test platform were built to verify the proposed control method. The results show that the proposed method can quickly complete the gear shift and effectively reduce the shift impact.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3529763.3529768;;;Systems AND Control
AI systems and product liability;;;['Georg Borges'];;;June 2021;;;ICAIL '21: Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law;;;The article examines whether the current product liability law provides an appropriate regulation for AI systems. This question, which is discussed at the example of the European Product Liability Directive, is of great practical importance in the current legal policy discussion on liability for AI systems. This article demonstrates that in principle the liability requirements are also applicable to AI systems. If the conduct of an AI system is carefully distinguished from its properties, excessive liability can be avoided. To reverse the burden of proof in favour of the injured party in the case of faulty behaviour enables a liability regime that is fair to the interests at stake. However, product liability law only applies if AI systems lead directly to personal injury or damage to property. Product liability law is not applicable insofar as AI systems indirectly lead to considerable disadvantages for the person concerned, in particular through assessments of persons. Protection against discrimination or otherwise unfair assessments by AI systems shall be effected by other legal instruments.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462757.3466099;;;Systems AND Control
Tool Integration for Automated Synthesis of Distributed Embedded Controllers;;;['Debayan Roy', 'Licong Zhang', 'Wanli Chang', 'Dip Goswami', 'Birgit Vogel-Heuser', 'Samarjit Chakraborty'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Controller design and their software implementations are usually done in isolated design spaces using respective COTS design tools. However, this separation of concerns can lead to long debugging and integration phases. This is because assumptions made about the implementation platform during the design phase—e.g., related to timing—might not hold in practice, thereby leading to unacceptable control performance. In order to address this, several control/architecture co-design techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of design flows using commercial tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that implements such a co-design method using commercially available design tools in an automotive setting, with the aim of minimally disrupting existing design flows practiced in the industry. The goal of such co-design is to jointly determine controller and platform parameters in order to avoid any design-implementation gap, thereby minimizing implementation time testing and debugging. Our setting involves distributed implementations of control algorithms on automotive electronic control units (ECUs) communicating via a FlexRay bus. The co-design and the associated toolchain Co-Flex jointly determines controller and FlexRay parameters (that impact signal delays) in order to optimize specified design metrics. Co-Flex seamlessly integrates the modeling and analysis of control systems in MATLAB/Simulink with platform modeling and configuration in SIMTOOLS/SIMTARGET that is used for configuring FlexRay bus parameters. It automates the generation of multiple Pareto-optimal design options with respect to the quality of control and the resource usage, that an engineer can choose from. In this article, we outline a step-by-step software development process based on Co-Flex tools for distributed control applications. While our exposition is automotive specific, this design flow can easily be extended to other domains.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477499;;;Systems AND Control
Key Qualities of Conversational Recommender Systems: From Users’ Perspective;;;['Yucheng Jin', 'Li Chen', 'Wanling Cai', 'Pearl Pu'];;;November 2021;;;HAI '21: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction;;;An increasing number of recommender systems enable conversational interaction to enhance the system’s overall user experience (UX). However, it is unclear what qualities of a conversational recommender system (CRS) are essential to determine the success of a CRS. This paper presents a model to capture the key qualities of conversational recommender systems and their related user experience aspects. Our model incorporates the characteristics of conversations (such as adaptability, understanding, response quality, rapport, humanness, etc.) in four major user experience dimensions of the recommender system: User Perceived Qualities, User Belief, User Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions. Following the psychometric modeling method, we validate the combined metrics using the data collected from an online user study of a conversational music recommender system. The user study results 1) support the consistency, validity, and reliability of the model that identifies seven key qualities of a CRS; and 2) reveal how conversation constructs interact with recommendation constructs to influence the overall user experience of a CRS. We believe that the key qualities identified in the model help practitioners design and evaluate conversational recommender systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472307.3484164;;;Systems AND Control
Doping Tests for Cyber-physical Systems;;;['Sebastian Biewer', 'Pedro R. D’argenio', 'Holger Hermanns'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation;;;The software running in embedded or cyber-physical systems is typically of proprietary nature, so users do not know precisely what the systems they own are (in)capable of doing. Most malfunctionings of such systems are not intended by the manufacturer, but some are, which means these cannot be classified as bugs or security loopholes. The most prominent examples have become public in the diesel emissions scandal, where millions of cars were found to be equipped with software violating the law, altogether polluting the environment and putting human health at risk. The behaviour of the software embedded in these cars was intended by the manufacturer, but it was not in the interest of society, a phenomenon that has been called software doping. Due to the unavailability of a specification, the analysis of doped software is significantly different from that for buggy or insecure software and hence classical verification and testing techniques have to be adapted.The work presented in this article builds on existing definitions of software doping and lays the theoretical foundations for conducting software doping tests, so as to enable uncovering unethical manufacturers. The complex nature of software doping makes it very hard to effectuate doping tests in practice. We explain the main challenges and provide efficient solutions to realise doping tests despite this complexity.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449354;;;Systems AND Control
Optimization and Control Algorithm of Construction Engineering Quality Cost Based on Data Mining Model;;;['Lu Han'];;;December 2021;;;ICASIT 2021: 2021 International Conference on Aviation Safety and Information Technology;;;It is very important to continuously strengthen cost control in construction project management, which can further improve the effective utilization of funds and better promote the development of enterprises. Therefore, in the process of practical application, enterprise managers need to improve their awareness of cost control, follow relevant principles and optimize control from many aspects, so as to better ensure the overall cost control effect and promote the development of construction enterprises. In this case, the construction engineering unit should reduce the production and operation cost of the enterprise and maximize the economic benefit.

A Control Model for Metro Train Movements: The Piecewise Nonlinear Time-domain Model;;;['Jinlin Liao', 'Jia Lin', 'Guilian Wu', 'Hao Chen', 'Shiyuan Ni', 'Tingting Lin', 'Lu Tang'];;;January 2022;;;AIEE '22: Proceedings of the 2022 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Electronics Engineering;;;Metros have been becoming a mainstream means of transportation in China. The research of various aspects of metro transportation has developed rapidly. However, how to construct a practical control model has always been a research hotspot. In this paper, we propose a piecewise nonlinear time-domain model (PNTM). This model describes a piecewise control process of the train driving in each section. The most notable feature of PNTM is that according to the electromagnetic principle of the motor, the acceleration process of the train is divided into three phases: constant torque, constant power, and natural characteristic. In each operation phase, speed, position, and instantaneous power are chosen to describe driving states of the train. Moreover, functional expressions instead of differential equation sets are used to formulate the driving states. Finally, the model is validated by numerical examples for comparison with the linear model and the measured data in real cases in Shanghai Metro Line 1 (SML1). The experimental results indicate that the correlation coefficients between PNTM and the measured data in terms of speed and power are 0.9874 and 0.9999, respectively, which are much higher than the 0.9251 and 0.9996 of the linear model.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512826.3512849;;;Systems AND Control

ABEBox: A data driven access control for securing public cloud storage with efficient key revocation;;;['Emanuele Raso', 'Lorenzo Bracciale', 'Pierpaolo Loreti', 'Giuseppe Bianchi'];;;August 2021;;;ARES '21: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security;;;Besides providing data sharing, commercial cloud-based storage services (e.g., Dropbox) also enforce access control, i.e. permit users to decide who can access which data. In this paper we advocate the separation between the sharing of data and the access control function. We specifically promote an overlay approach which provides end-to-end encryption and empowers the end users with the possibility to enforce access control policies without involving the cloud provider itself. To this end, our proposal, named ABEBox, relies on the careful combination of i) attribute-based encryption for custom policy definition and management, with ii) proxy re-encryption to provide scalable re-keying and protection to key-scraping attacks, with a novel revocation procedure. Moreover, iii) we concretely embed our protection mechanisms inside a public domain virtual file system module to provide an overlay and trivial-to-use transparent service which can be deployed on top of any arbitrary cloud storage provider.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465481.3469206;;;Systems AND Control

Real-time Approximate Routing for Smart Transit Systems;;;['Noémie Périvier', 'Chamsi Hssaine', 'Samitha Samaranayake', 'Siddhartha Banerjee'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems;;;We study real-time routing policies in smart transit systems, where the platform has a combination of cars and high-capacity vehicles (e.g., buses or shuttles) and seeks to serve a set of incoming trip requests. The platform can use its fleet of cars as a feeder to connect passengers to its high-capacity fleet, which operates on fixed routes. Our goal is to find the optimal set of (bus) routes and corresponding frequencies to maximize the social welfare of the system in a given time window. This generalizes the Line Planning Problem, a widely studied topic in the transportation literature, for which existing solutions are either heuristic (with no performance guarantees), or require extensive computation time (and hence are impractical for real-time use). To this end, we develop a 1-1/e-ε approximation algorithm for the Real-Time Line Planning Problem, using ideas from randomized rounding and the Generalized Assignment Problem. Our guarantee holds under two assumptions: (i) no inter-bus transfers and (ii) access to a pre-specified set of feasible bus lines. We moreover show that these two assumptions are crucial by proving that, if either assumption is relaxed, the łineplanningproblem does not admit any constant-factor approximation. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm via numerical experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, in which we show that, given a fixed time budget, our algorithm outperforms Integer Linear Programming-based exact methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460091;;;Systems AND Control
The Lord of the Ring Road: A Review and Evaluation of Autonomous Control Policies for Traffic in a Ring Road;;;['Fang-Chieh Chou', 'Alben Rome Bagabaldo', 'Alexandre M. Bayen'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;This study focuses on the comprehensive investigation of stop-and-go waves appearing in closed-circuit ring road traffic wherein we evaluate various longitudinal dynamical models for vehicles. It is known that the behavior of human-driven vehicles, with other traffic elements such as density held constant, could stimulate stop-and-go waves, which do not dissipate on the circuit ring road. Stop-and-go waves can be dissipated by adding automated vehicles (AVs) to the ring. Thorough investigations of the performance of AV longitudinal control algorithms were carried out in Flow, which is an integrated platform for reinforcement learning on traffic control. Ten AV algorithms presented in the literature are evaluated. For each AV algorithm, experiments are carried out by varying distributions and penetration rates of AVs. Two different distributions of AVs are studied. For the first distribution scenario, AVs are placed consecutively. Penetration rates are varied from 1 AV (5%) to all AVs (100%). For the second distribution scenario, AVs are placed with even distribution of human-driven vehicles in between any two AVs. In this scenario, penetration rates are varied from 2 AVs (10%) to 11 AVs (50%). Multiple runs (10 runs) are simulated to average out the randomness in the results. From more than 3,000 simulation experiments, we investigated how AV algorithms perform differently with varying distributions and penetration rates while all AV algorithms remained fixed under all distributions and penetration rates. Time to stabilize, maximum headway, vehicle miles traveled, and fuel economy are used to evaluate their performance. Using these metrics, we find that the traffic condition improvement is not necessarily dependent on the distribution for most of the AV controllers, particularly when no cooperation among AVs is considered. Traffic condition is generally improved with a higher AV penetration rate with only one of the AV algorithms showing a contrary trend. Among all AV algorithms in this study, the reinforcement learning controller shows the most consistent improvement under all distributions and penetration rates.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494577;;;Systems AND Control
Coordinate ascent MORE with adaptive entropy control for population-based regret minimization;;;['Maximilian Hüttenrauch', 'Gerhard Neumann'];;;July 2021;;;GECCO '21: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion;;;Model-based Relative Entropy Policy Search (MORE) is a population-based stochastic search algorithm with desirable properties such as a well defined policy search objective, i.e., it optimizes the expected return, and exact closed form information theoretic update rules. This is in contrast with existing population-based methods, that are often referred to as evolutionary strategies, such as CMA-ES. While these methods work very well in practice, the updates of the search distribution are often based on heuristics and they do not optimize the expected return of the population but instead implicitly optimize the return of elite samples, which may yield a poor expected return and unreliable or risky solutions. We show that the MORE algorithm can be improved with distinct updates based on coordinate ascent on the mean and covariance of the search distribution, which considerably improves the convergence speed while maintaining the exact closed form updates. In this way, we can match the performance of elite samples of CMA-ES while also showing a considerably improved performance of the sample average. We evaluate our new algorithm on simulated robotic tasks and compare to the state of the art CMA-ES.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449726.3463183;;;Systems AND Control

Towards Multidisciplinary Delta-Oriented Variability Management in Cyber-Physical Production Systems;;;['Hafiyyan Sayyid Fadhlillah', 'Kevin Feichtinger', 'Kristof Meixner', 'Lisa Sonnleithner', 'Rick Rabiser', 'Alois Zoitl'];;;February 2022;;;VaMoS '22: Proceedings of the 16th International Working Conference on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems;;;Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) are complex systems comprised of software and hardware interacting with each other and the environment. In industry, over time, a plethora of CPPSs are developed to satisfy varying customer requirements and changing technologies. Managing variability is challenging, especially in multidisciplinary environments like in CPPS engineering. For instance, when supporting the automatic derivation and configuration of control software, one needs to understand variability from not only a software perspective, but also a mechatronic, electrical, process, and business perspective. It is unrealistic to use a single model or even one type of model across these perspectives. In this paper, we describe a Multidisciplinary Delta-Oriented Variability Management approach for CPPSs that we are currently developing. Our approach aims to express CPPS variability in different disciplines using heterogeneous variability models, relating models via cross-discipline constraints, and automatically generating control software based on variability models. We implemented a prototype of our approach by realizing delta-oriented variability modeling for IEC 61499-based distributed control software and a configuration tool to enact the configuration options from multiple variability models. We performed a feasibility study of our approach using two systems of different size and complexity. We conclude that, despite current limitations, our approach can successfully and automatically generate control software based on related multidisciplinary variability models. We think that our approach is a good starting point to manage CPPS variability in practice.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510466.3511273;;;Systems AND Control

Modelling Drivers’ Adaptation to Assistance Systems;;;['Jussi P. P. Jokinen', 'Tuomo Kujala'];;;September 2021;;;AutomotiveUI '21: 13th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications;;;Human factors research and engineering of advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) must consider how drivers adapt to their presence. The major obstruction to this at the moment is poor understanding of the details of the adaptive processes that the human cognition undergoes when faced with such changes. This paper presents a simulation model that predicts how drivers adapt to a steering assistance system. Our approach is based on computational rationality, and demonstrates how task interleaving strategies adapt to the task environment and the driver’s goals and cognitive limitations. A supervisor controls eye movements between the driving and non-driving tasks, making this choice on the basis of maximising expected joint task utility. The model predicts that with steering assistance, drivers’ in car glance durations increase. We also show that this adaptation leads to risky driving in cases where the reliability of the system is compromised.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3409118.3475150;;;Systems AND Control

ConAML: Constrained Adversarial Machine Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Jiangnan Li', 'Yingyuan Yang', 'Jinyuan Stella Sun', 'Kevin Tomsovic', 'Hairong Qi'];;;May 2021;;;ASIA CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;Recent research demonstrated that the superficially well-trained machine learning (ML) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. As ML techniques are becoming a popular solution for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) applications in research literatures, the security of these applications is of concern. However, current studies on adversarial machine learning (AML) mainly focus on pure cyberspace domains. The risks the adversarial examples can bring to the CPS applications have not been well investigated. In particular, due to the distributed property of data sources and the inherent physical constraints imposed by CPSs, the widely-used threat models and the state-of-the-art AML algorithms in previous cyberspace research become infeasible. We study the potential vulnerabilities of ML applied in CPSs by proposing Constrained Adversarial Machine Learning (ConAML), which generates adversarial examples that satisfy the intrinsic constraints of the physical systems. We first summarize the difference between AML in CPSs and AML in existing cyberspace systems and propose a general threat model for ConAML. We then design a best-effort search algorithm to iteratively generate adversarial examples with linear physical constraints. We evaluate our algorithms with simulations of two typical CPSs, the power grids and the water treatment system. The results show that our ConAML algorithms can effectively generate adversarial examples which significantly decrease the performance of the ML models even under practical constraints.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3433210.3437513;;;Systems AND Control
Self-Sustainable Cyber-Physical Systems with Collaborative Intermittent Computing;;;['Gaosheng Liu', 'Lin Wang'];;;June 2021;;;e-Energy '21: Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems;;;Cyber-physical systems have become a main technology driver for our intelligent society. However, almost all cyber-physical systems rely on battery-powered devices to function, which suffer from high maintenance cost for recharging/replacing the batteries and bring in negative environmental impacts due to the hazardous chemicals used in the batteries. To address this challenge, a new computing paradigm called intermittent computing (IC) was proposed which advocates a battery-free design where cyber-physical devices can be completely powered by energy scavenged from ambient sources such as sunlight, radio waves, and vibrations. Since its advent, many efforts have been made on addressing the challenges in IC, from the hardware to the software stack. In this vision paper, we make a brief summary of existing works on IC and discuss a more realistic setup where, instead of focusing on one IC node as done in most existing works, we propose to build a self-sustainable cyber-physical system through the collaboration of distributed IC devices---collaborative intermittent computing (CIC).

Regrettably, the security of IoT devices is often being overlooked. Among the vast array of security issues plaguing the emerging IoT, we decide to focus on access control, as privacy, trust, and other security properties cannot be achieved without controlled access. This article classifies IoT access control solutions from the literature according to their architecture (e.g., centralized, hierarchical, federated, distributed) and examines the suitability of each one for access control purposes. Our analysis concludes that important properties such as auditability and revocation are missing from many proposals while hierarchical and federated architectures are neglected by the community.

SAGE: A Split-Architecture Methodology for Efficient End-to-End Autonomous Vehicle Control;;;['Arnav Malawade', 'Mohanad Odema', 'Sebastien Lajeunesse-degroot', 'Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to revolutionize transportation and improve road safety significantly. However, these benefits do not come without cost; AVs require large Deep-Learning (DL) models and powerful hardware platforms to operate reliably in real-time, requiring between several hundred watts to one kilowatt of power. This power consumption can dramatically reduce vehicles’ driving range and affect emissions. To address this problem, we propose SAGE: a methodology for selectively offloading the key energy-consuming modules of DL architectures to the cloud to optimize edge, energy usage while meeting real-time latency constraints. Furthermore, we leverage Head Network Distillation (HND) to introduce efficient bottlenecks within the DL architecture in order to minimize the network overhead costs of offloading with almost no degradation in the model’s performance. We evaluate SAGE using an Nvidia Jetson TX2 and an industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 as the AV edge, devices and demonstrate that our offloading strategy is practical for a wide range of DL models and internet connection bandwidths on 3G, 4G LTE, and WiFi technologies. Compared to edge-only computation, SAGE reduces energy consumption by an average of 36.13%, 47.07%, and 55.66% for an AV with one low-resolution camera, one high-resolution camera, and three high-resolution cameras, respectively. SAGE also reduces upload data size by up to 98.40% compared to direct camera offloading.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477006;;;Systems AND Control

Moving from traditional one-to-one to many-to-many communication, publish/subscribe systems promise a more dynamic and efficient exchange of data. However, the resulting significantly more complex communication relationships render traditional end-to-end security futile for sufficiently protecting the sensitive and safety-critical data transmitted in industrial systems. Most notably, the central message brokers inherent in publish/subscribe systems introduce a designated weak spot for security as they can access all communication messages. To address this issue, we propose ENTRUST, a novel solution for key server-based end-to-end security in publish/subscribe systems. ENTRUST transparently realizes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for publish/subscribe systems without any modification of the underlying protocol.

A saturated position control and a Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) based attitude control determine command attitude and provide attitude tracking without singularity. A projection based adaptive law estimates unknown moment of inertia and ensures estimation always stay inside a pre-defined compact set. A rigorous stability analysis proves that closed-loop system is stable and error signals are asymptotically converging. Simulation results demonstrate the theoretical conjecture of the proposed controller.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478586.3478595;;;Systems AND Control

However, from a research perspective, existing hardware platforms are limited: they are often optimized for concrete, narrow use-cases and, therefore lack the flexibility needed to explore other applications and configurations.   We show that a research group can design and build a more general, open, and affordable hardware platform for hybrid systems research. The platform, Enzian, is capable of duplicating the functionality of existing CPU/FPGA systems with comparable performance but in an open, flexible system. It couples a large FPGA with a server-class CPU in an asymmetric cache-coherent NUMA system. Enzian also enables research not possible with existing hybrid platforms, through explicit access to coherence messages, extensive thermal and power instrumentation, and an open, programmable baseboard management processor.   Enzian is already being used in multiple projects, is open source (both hardware and software), and available for remote use. We present the design principles of Enzian, the challenges in building it, and evaluate it with a range of existing research use-cases alongside other, more specialized platforms, as well as demonstrating research not possible on existing platforms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503222.3507742;;;Systems AND Control
Towards Robust Models of Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Matthias Schaffeld', 'Torben Weis'];;;September 2021;;;UbiComp/ISWC '21 Adjunct: Adjunct Proceedings of the 2021 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and Proceedings of the 2021 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers;;;Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) combine software with the physical world. For this purpose, CPS must model physical behavior in software. However, a software-based model cannot always accurately reflect the physical world. Often the model is a simplification of complex physical processes, or it suffers from measurement errors, or the physical side is subject to modifications and parameter drift, or the model is simply subject to misconceptions. It is an open research challenge how we can verify that physics and software-based model fit together. However, to rely on CPS in real-world scenarios we must ensure that physics and model are aligned. We propose a model formalism based on hidden Markov models that considers uncertainty and unknown phenomena and is robust enough to allow the analysis of CPS when working with error-prone data. More specifically, given observation data and an instance of the proposed model for a CPS (both of which may be flawed) the proposed formalism allows us to quantify the suitability between physics and model. If, however, a given model instance is deemed correct, the formalism enables methods which identify and smooth corrupt observation data as well as compute the most likely sequence of events for a given set of observations. Additionally, the formalism enables the learning of a suitable model according to given observation data. The model formalism will be tested with a simulation and a case study of an overhead traveling cargo crane system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460418.3479314;;;Systems AND Control

First, we give an overview of a WLBOT system. Second, the hardware design and the software architecture of the embedded controller are introduced. The embedded controller takes charge of multi-sensor information processing and signal output of the servo valve, as well as receiving control command and sending processed information via Control Area Network (CAN) bus. What's more, the realization of the 2kHz high-speed control of the embedded controller is illustrated. Finally, the platform is constructed, in which the feasibility of the design and the validity of the control algorithm is verified.

Collaborative Reflection-Augmented Autoencoder Network for Recommender Systems;;;['Lianghao Xia', 'Chao Huang', 'Yong Xu', 'Huance Xu', 'Xiang Li', 'Weiguo Zhang'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Information Systems;;;As the deep learning techniques have expanded to real-world recommendation tasks, many deep neural network based Collaborative Filtering (CF) models have been developed to project user-item interactions into latent feature space, based on various neural architectures, such as multi-layer perceptron, autoencoder, and graph neural networks. However, the majority of existing collaborative filtering systems are not well designed to handle missing data. Particularly, in order to inject the negative signals in the training phase, these solutions largely rely on negative sampling from unobserved user-item interactions and simply treating them as negative instances, which brings the recommendation performance degradation. To address the issues, we develop a Collaborative Reflection-Augmented Autoencoder Network (CRANet), that is capable of exploring transferable knowledge from observed and unobserved user-item interactions. The network architecture of CRANet is formed of an integrative structure with a reflective receptor network and an information fusion autoencoder module, which endows our recommendation framework with the ability of encoding implicit user’s pairwise preference on both interacted and non-interacted items. Additionally, a parametric regularization-based tied-weight scheme is designed to perform robust joint training of the two-stage CRANetmodel. We finally experimentally validate CRANeton four diverse benchmark datasets corresponding to two recommendation tasks, to show that debiasing the negative signals of user-item interactions improves the performance as compared to various state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

Dynamic Defense In-Depth Model for SDN Control Layer to Enhance OpenFlow Protocol Security;;;['Mahmoud Elhejazi', 'Mohamed Musbah'];;;October 2021;;;ICEMIS'21: The 7th International Conference on Engineering &amp; MIS 2021;;;The traditional long-established networks and networking techniques are no longer suitable for future ever-expanding networking requirements, specifically, the automation and programmability of network communications. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is the most agreeable solution for that. SDN logically uses a centralized controller that applies a standard open Application Programming Interface (API) to directly control the packet handling functions of network devices. OpenFlow is currently the main and widely known communication protocol in SDN architectures. As a result of such centralization, the SDN architecture subjected the controller as a single point with more attacks surfaces for each layer. This entails the search for more security and protection procedures to the SDN architecture without scarifying its swift response to changing business requirements. This paper aims to enhance the protection of the divisions' concept in SDN architecture, which reduces the creation of more attack surfaces that can be targeted by malicious activities. Thus, the research focuses on the design of a dependable SDN controller platform model via Defense In-Depth (DID) techniques, including the requirements for a secure, resilient, and robust controller. The Dynamic Defense In-Depth (DDID) model is proposed to be deployed for the SDN control layer to enhance overall OpenFlow protocol security. Detailed measurable threats and protection mechanisms, according to the DDID model, were investigated and implemented using a simulation environment (mininet). Also, the paper proposes an evaluation mechanism (and tests) to confirm the applicability of secure structure requirements to the SDN controller layer. The obtained results confirm the promising potential of achieving the required security goals.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492547.3492625;;;Systems AND Control
Metastable failures in distributed systems;;;['Nathan Bronson', 'Abutalib Aghayev', 'Aleksey Charapko', 'Timothy Zhu'];;;June 2021;;;HotOS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems;;;We describe metastable failures---a failure pattern in distributed systems. Currently, metastable failures manifest themselves as black swan events; they are outliers because nothing in the past points to their possibility, have a severe impact, and are much easier to explain in hindsight than to predict. Although instances of metastable failures can look different at the surface, deeper analysis shows that they can be understood within the same framework. We introduce a framework for thinking about metastable failures, apply it to examples observed during years of operating distributed systems at scale, and survey ad-hoc techniques developed post-factum for making systems resilient to known metastable failures. A systematic approach for building systems that are robust against unknown meta-stable failures remains an open problem.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458336.3465286;;;Systems AND Control

This situation poses a huge challenge to the currently widely used cloud computing model. Edge computing is a new computing model that provides intelligent services at the edge of the network close to the source of things or data. It can save network traffic, improve response speed and protect user privacy. It shows better performance than cloud computing in IoT applications, has been highly concerned and unanimously recognized by the industry and academia. With the rapid development of my country's economy, information-based production tools have entered all aspects of people's work and life such as industry, agriculture, commerce, medical care, education, etc., and online commerce, online banking, and online medical services that involve personal private information. Services are increasing, and national military and political intelligence is transmitted more frequently through the Internet. Under this circumstance, ensuring the security of information has increasingly become the most urgent problem that needs to be solved quickly in today's society. It is occupies the most important position in the national industrial layout and even the national security strategy pattern. In this context, with "Grade protection 2.0" as the standard, the core content of "Grade protection 2.0" is "one center, triple protection". That is to build a security management center, do a good job in the protection of the computing environment, regional boundaries and communication networks, and form a comprehensive network security defense system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3501409.3501468;;;Systems AND Control
Towards a User Integration Framework for Personal Health Decision Support and Recommender Systems;;;['Katja Herrmanny', 'Helma Torkamaan'];;;June 2021;;;UMAP '21: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization;;;Supporting personal health with Decision Support Systems (DSS) and, specifically, recommender systems (RS) is a promising and growing area of research. Integrating the user in the loop is vital in such health systems due to the complexity of recommendations, gravity of the decisions and the reliance on user autonomy. However, for such a purpose, to the best of our knowledge there exists no profound or comprehensive framework nor model to guide system designers, to exploit the full potential of integrating users in the system’s reasoning process by design. In this paper, we present a multifaceted user integration framework in personal health-related DSS and RS. This framework, with three main components, has been derived from an iterative mixed-methods development and evaluation procedure, including expert workshops and extensive multidisciplinary literature reviews. Users are accordingly integrated into the whole process from system reasoning until decision making through the following actionable design strategies: (1) Empower: Enabling them to understand the result generation and implications, (2) Encourage: encouraging them to question and reflect system outcomes and to get involved in the generation process and (3) Engage: enabling them to take an active role by facilitating and providing opportunities for user control. The framework offers support to designers of personal health-related DSS and RS in properly integrating users into their systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450613.3456816;;;Systems AND Control

Massively Parallel Molecular-Continuum Flow Simulation with Error Control and Dynamic Ensemble Handling;;;['Vahid Jafari', 'Niklas Wittmer', 'Philipp Neumann'];;;January 2022;;;HPCAsia2022: International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia-Pacific Region;;;In coupled molecular-continuum flow simulations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations exhibit thermal fluctuations. Finding a way to minimize the impact of these fluctuations on the CFD solver, e.g. in terms of stability, and to control the corresponding statistical error plays a key role in order to obtain reliable results.  In this paper, statistical error analysis is employed for MD simulations to determine the statistical error in flow velocities and the number of MD data samples to bound this error. The corresponding error estimator is augmented by a dynamic ensemble handling approach, which allows to couple a variable number of MD simulation instances to a single CFD solver. The ensemble members can be simulated independently from each other over separate coupling time intervals, enabling a high level of (MPI-based) parallelism. Adding or removing MD simulations to/from the ensemble allows to regulate the error and keep it under a prescribed threshold. All functionality is implemented in the massively parallel macro-micro-coupling tool (MaMiCo). We validate our approach by coupled molecular-continuum Couette flow simulation for liquid argon and provide scalability tests on up to 131.072 cores. The computational overhead for handling the dynamic MD ensemble is found to be rather negligible.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492805.3492812;;;Systems AND Control
Protection or Punishment? Relating the Design Space of Parental Control Apps and Perceptions about Them to Support Parenting for Online Safety;;;['Ge Wang', 'Jun Zhao', 'Max Van Kleek', 'Nigel Shadbolt'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction;;;Parental control apps, which are mobile apps that allow parents to monitor and restrict their children's activities online, are becoming increasingly adopted by parents as a means of safeguarding their children's online safety. However, it is not clear whether these apps are always beneficial or effective in what they aim to do; for instance, the overuse of restriction and surveillance has been found to undermine parent-child relationship and children's sense of autonomy. While previous research has categorised and taken inventory of key features of popular parental control apps, they have not systematically analysed the ways such features were designed or realised in such apps, or in particular how aspects of such designs might relate to parents and children's experiences with such apps. In this work, we investigate this gap, asking specifically: how might children's and parents' perceptions be related to how parental control features were designed? To investigate this question, we conducted an analysis of 58 top Android parental control apps designed for the purpose of promoting children's online safety, finding three major axes of variation in how key restriction and monitoring features were realised: granularity, feedback/transparency, and parent-child communications support. To relate these axes to perceived benefits and problems, we then analysed 3264 app reviews to identify references to aspects of the each of the axes above, to understand children's and parents' views of how such dimensions related to their experiences with these apps. Our findings led towards 1) an understanding of how parental control apps realise their functionalities differently along three axes of variation, 2) an analysis of exactly the ways that such variation influences children's and parents' perceptions, respectively of the usefulness or effectiveness of these apps, and finally 3) an identification of design recommendations and opportunities for future apps by contextualising our findings within existing digital parenting theories.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3476084;;;Systems AND Control

Rotten and Possessed: Control and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice as Models of Outmersive Game Design;;;['PS Berge'];;;August 2021;;;HT '21: Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media;;;Control (Remedy Entertainment) and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (Ninja Theory) demonstrate the potential for game design that defies expectations of immersive gameplay and embodied avatars. Building on game scholarship that recognizes 'immersion' as a "double-axis of incorporation" [8] consisting of a "complex interplay of actual and virtual worlds as perceived through a dually embodied player" [26,p. 73], we can see how these games achieve powerful moments of coattention through outmersive game design-deliberately alienating the player from an embodied avatar experience. Outmersion,a term coined by Gonzalo Frasca, offers a broader categorization for games that procedurally engender "critical distance" by directing player attention to and outside of the game itself [16]. This article uses close-play to explore how the characters of Jesse Faden in Control and Senua in Hellblade make use of the 'coinhabited avatar' trope-in which the avatar is possessed by non-player entities. This article identifies shared outcomes in the outmersive design of these characters, namely that they: 1) directly invoked the player 2) complicated the player's place in the avatar body 3) deceived the player 4) took agency from the player and 5) referenced game structures directly. Through outmersion, these games created provocative moments of player attention and reflection, simultaneously interrogating assumptions of power, rules, and embodiment. This article advocates for further exploration of outmersive game and interactive narrative design to challenge dominant presumptions about player-avatar interactions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465336.3475094;;;Systems AND Control

However, defining a vocabulary of gestures that is adequate to this environment's physical characteristics, the sensors used, and the tasks performed by users while interacting is a challenge for developers. Methodologies and guidelines proposed in the literature to the gestures definition do not consider the characteristics of the critical environment, causing natural and innovative interaction to fail by not meeting the user's need. In this sense, our paper discusses the main challenges imposed by critical environments in gesture interaction development.

Evaluating Safe Handovers with Advance Notice and Explanations in HAD;;;['Frederik Wiehr', 'Anke Hirsch', 'Lukas Schmitz', 'Nina Knieriemen', 'Antonio Krüger', 'Alisa Kovtunova', 'Stefan Borgwardt', 'Ernie Chang', 'Vera Demberg', 'Marcel Steinmetz', 'Jörg Hoffmann'];;;October 2021;;;ICMI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction;;;In highly automated driving (HAD), it is still an open question how machines can safely hand over control to humans, and if an advance notice with additional explanations can be beneficial in critical situations. Conceptually, use of formal methods from AI – description logic (DL) and automated planning – in order to more reliably predict when a handover is necessary, and to increase the advance notice for handovers by planning ahead at runtime, can provide a technological support for explanations using natural language generation. However, in this work we address only the user’s perspective with two contributions: First, we evaluate our concept in a driving simulator study (N=23) and find that an advance notice and spoken explanations were preferred over classical handover methods. Second, we propose a framework and an example test scenario specific to handovers that is based on the results of our study.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462244.3479884;;;Systems AND Control
Fast Corotated Elastic SPH Solids with Implicit Zero-Energy Mode Control;;;['Tassilo Kugelstadt', 'Jan Bender', 'José Antonio Fernández-Fernández', 'Stefan Rhys Jeske', 'Fabian Löschner', 'Andreas Longva'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques;;;We develop a new operator splitting formulation for the simulation of corotated linearly elastic solids with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Based on the technique of Kugelstadt et al. [2018] originally developed for the Finite Element Method (FEM), we split the elastic energy into two separate terms corresponding to stretching and volume conservation, and based on this principle, we design a splitting scheme compatible with SPH. The operator splitting scheme enables us to treat the two terms separately, and because the stretching forces lead to a stiffness matrix that is constant in time, we are able to prefactor the system matrix for the implicit integration step. Solid-solid contact and fluid-solid interaction is achieved through a unified pressure solve. We demonstrate more than an order of magnitude improvement in computation time compared to a state-of-the-art SPH simulator for elastic solids.We further improve the stability and reliability of the simulation through several additional contributions. We introduce a new implicit penalty mechanism that suppresses zero-energy modes inherent in the SPH formulation for elastic solids, and present a new, physics-inspired sampling algorithm for generating high-quality particle distributions for the rest shape of an elastic solid. We finally also devise an efficient method for interpolating vertex positions of a high-resolution surface mesh based on the SPH particle positions for use in high-fidelity visualization.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3480142;;;Systems AND Control

Speech could improve interaction in multimodal VEs by enabling users to address objects, locations, and agents, yet research on how to design effective speech for VEs is limited. Our paper investigates the effect of agent feedback on speech VE experiences. Through a lab study, users commanded agents to navigate a VE, receiving either auditory, visual or behavioural feedback. Based on a post interaction semi-structured interview, we find that the type of feedback given by agents is critical to user experience. Specifically auditory mechanisms are preferred, allowing users to engage with other modalities seamlessly during interaction. Although command-like utterances were frequently used, it was perceived as contextually appropriate, ensuring users were understood. Many also found it difficult to discover speech-based functionality. Drawing on these, we discuss key challenges for designing speech input for VEs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3469595.3469609;;;Systems AND Control
DataOps for Cyber-Physical Systems Governance: The Airport Passenger Flow Case;;;['Martin Garriga', 'Koen Aarns', 'Christos Tsigkanos', 'Damian A. Tamburri', 'Wjan Van Den Heuvel'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Internet Technology;;;Recent advancements in information technology have ushered a new wave of systems integrating Internet technology with sensing, wireless communication, and computational resources over existing infrastructures. As a result, myriad complex, non-traditional Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have emerged, characterized by interaction among people, physical facilities, and embedded sensors and computers, all generating vast amounts of complex data. Such a case is encountered within a contemporary airport hall setting: passengers roaming, information systems governing various functions, and data being generated and processed by cameras, phones, sensors, and other Internet of Things technology. This setting has considerable potential of contributing to goals entertained by the CPS operators, such as airlines, airport operators/owners, technicians, users, and more. We model the airport setting as an instance of such a complex, data-intensive CPS where multiple actors and data sources interact, and generalize a methodology to support it and other similar systems. Furthermore, this article instantiates the methodology and pipeline for predictive analytics for passenger flow, as a characteristic manifestation of such systems requiring a tailored approach. Our methodology also draws from DataOps principles, using multi-modal and real-life data to predict the underlying distribution of the passenger flow on a flight-level basis (improving existing day-level predictions), anticipating when and how the passengers enter the airport and move through the check-in and baggage drop-off process. This allows to plan airport resources more efficiently while improving customer experience by avoiding passenger clumping at check-in and security. We demonstrate results obtained over a case from a major international airport in the Netherlands, improving up to 60% upon predictions of daily passenger flow currently in place.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432247;;;Systems AND Control

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to synthesizing neural networks as barrier certificates. Candidate networks are trained from a special structure: ReLU neural networks consisting of two hidden layers. Then, the problem of identifying real barrier certificates from candidates is transformed into a group of mixed integer linear programming problems and a mixed integer quadratically constrained problem. Taking full advantage of the recent advance in optimization, barrier certificates validation can be performed effectively. We implement the tool SyntheBC and evaluate its performance over 3 hybrid systems and 8 continuous systems up to 12-dimensional state space. The experimental results show that our method is more scalable and effective than the classical polynomial barrier certificate method and the existing neural network based method.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456638;;;Systems AND Control

CRDTs for truly concurrent file systems;;;['Romain Vaillant', 'Dimitrios Vasilas', 'Marc Shapiro', 'Thuy Linh Nguyen'];;;July 2021;;;HotStorage '21: Proceedings of the 13th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Storage and File Systems;;;Building scalable and highly available geo-replicated file systems is hard. These systems need to resolve conflicts that emerge in concurrent operations in a way that maintains file system invariants, is meaningful to the user, and does not depart from the traditional file system interface. Conflict resolution in existing systems often leads to unexpected or inconsistent results. This paper introduces ElmerFS, a geo-replicated, truly concurrent file system designed with the aim of addressing these challenges. ElmerFS is based on two key ideas: (1) the use of Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for representing file system structures, which ensures that replicas converge to a correct state, and (2) conflict resolution rules, which are determined by the choice of CRDT types and their composition, are designed with the principle of being intuitive to the user. We argue that if the state of the file system after resolving a conflict conveys to the user the resolved conflict in an intuitive way, the user can complement or reverse it using traditional file system operations. We discuss the challenges in the design of geo-replicated weakly consistent file systems, and present the design of ElmerFS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465332.3470872;;;Systems AND Control
Deep Reinforcement Learning With Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting for Data-Driven Base Station Sleep Control;;;['Qiong Wu', 'Xu Chen', 'Zhi Zhou', 'Liang Chen', 'Junshan Zhang'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;To meet the ever increasing mobile traffic demand in 5G era, base stations (BSs) have been densely deployed in radio access networks (RANs) to increase the network coverage and capacity. However, as the high density of BSs is designed to accommodate peak traffic, it would consume an unnecessarily large amount of energy if BSs are on during off-peak time. To save the energy consumption of cellular networks, an effective way is to deactivate some idle base stations that do not serve any traffic demand. In this paper, we develop a traffic-aware dynamic BS sleep control framework, named DeepBSC, which presents a novel data-driven learning approach to determine the BS active/sleep modes while meeting lower energy consumption and satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Specifically, the traffic demands are predicted by the proposed GS-STN model, which leverages the geographical and semantic spatial-temporal correlations of mobile traffic. With accurate mobile traffic forecasting, the BS sleep control problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process that is solved by Actor-Critic reinforcement learning methods. To reduce the variance of cost estimation in the dynamic environment, we propose a benchmark transformation method that provides robust performance indicator for policy update. To expedite the training process, we adopt a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach, together with an explorer network, which can strengthen the exploration further. Extensive experiments with a real-world dataset corroborate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the existing methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3053771;;;Systems AND Control

The overall system design includes three parts: hardware platform design with MicroBlaze as the core controller, software application design and OSD (On Screen Display) display control design. The system proposed in this paper implements the encoding, decoding, scaling and overlay of multiple high-definition video streams in a single FPGA embedded with MicroBlaze, which improves the system integration. Through the design of the OSD control layered architecture, the information interaction between the keystrokes and the OSD image interface is realized, and four video display parameters can be configured on the screen. Experiments show that the system proposed in this paper can process and display four high-definition video streams in real time, with an output frame rate of 60 frames/s.

Verifying Stochastic Hybrid Systems with Temporal Logic Specifications via Model Reduction;;;['Yu Wang', 'Nima Roohi', 'Matthew West', 'Mahesh Viswanathan', 'Geir E.

Using the Mori–Zwanzig reduction method, we construct a finite-state Markov chain reduction of a given stochastic hybrid system and prove that this reduced Markov chain is approximately equivalent to the original system in a distributional sense. Approximate equivalence of the stochastic hybrid system and its Markov chain reduction means that analyzing the Markov chain with respect to a suitably strengthened property allows us to conclude whether the original stochastic hybrid system meets its temporal logic specifications. Based on this, we propose the first statistical model checking algorithms to verify stochastic hybrid systems against correctness properties, expressed in iLTL or iMITL. The scalability of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by a case study.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3483380;;;Systems AND Control
Humanized Recommender Systems: State-of-the-art and Research Issues;;;['Thi Ngoc Trang Tran', 'Alexander Felfernig', 'Nava Tintarev'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems;;;Psychological factors such as personality, emotions, social connections, and decision biases can significantly affect the outcome of a decision process. These factors are also prevalent in the existing literature related to the inclusion of psychological aspects in recommender system development. Personality and emotions of users have strong connections with their interests and decision-making behavior. Hence, integrating these factors into recommender systems can help to better predict users’ item preferences and increase the satisfaction with recommended items. In scenarios where decisions are made by groups (e.g., selecting a tourism destination to visit with friends), group composition and social connections among group members can affect the outcome of a group decision. Decision biases often occur in a recommendation process, since users usually apply heuristics when making a decision. These biases can result in low-quality decisions. In this article, we provide a rigorous review of existing research on the influence of the mentioned psychological factors on recommender systems. These factors are not only considered in single-user recommendation scenarios but, importantly, also in group recommendation ones, where groups of users are involved in a decision-making process. We include working examples to provide a deeper understanding of how to take into account these factors in recommendation processes. The provided examples go beyond single-user recommendation scenarios by also considering specific aspects of group recommendation settings.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3446906;;;Systems AND Control
Hybrid blockchain database systems: design and performance;;;['Zerui Ge', 'Dumitrel Loghin', 'Beng Chin Ooi', 'Pingcheng Ruan', 'Tianwen Wang'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment;;;With the emergence of hybrid blockchain database systems, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the performance and trade-offs among a few representative systems. To achieve this goal, we implement Veritas and BlockchainDB from scratch. For Veritas, we provide two flavors to target the crash fault-tolerant (CFT) and Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) application scenarios. Specifically, we implement Veritas with Apache Kafka to target CFT application scenarios, and Veritas with Tendermint to target BFT application scenarios. We compare these three systems with the existing open-source implementation of BigchainDB. BigchainDB uses Tender-mint for consensus and provides two flavors: a default implementation with blockchain pipelining and an optimized version that includes blockchain pipelining and parallel transaction validation. Our experimental analysis confirms that CFT designs, which are typically used by distributed databases, exhibit much higher performance than BFT designs, which are specific to blockchains. On the other hand, our extensive analysis highlights the variety of design choices faced by the developers and sheds some light on the trade-offs that need to be done when designing a hybrid blockchain database system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3510397.3510406;;;Systems AND Control
Advanced Domain-Driven Design for Consistency in Distributed Data-Intensive Systems;;;['Susanne Braun', 'Annette Bieniusa', 'Frank Elberzhager'];;;April 2021;;;PaPoC '21: Proceedings of the 8th Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data;;;More and more data-intensive systems have emerged lately. Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, or cloud-native applications all require high scalability and availability. Data is no longer persisted in one central relational database with serialized and transactional access, but rather distributed and replicated among different nodes running only under eventual consistency. This poses a number of design challenges for software architects, as they cannot rely on a single system to mask the concurrency anomalies of concurrent access to distributed and replicated data. Based on three case studies, we developed a theory regarding how practitioners handle synchronization and consistency design challenges in distributed data-intensive applications. We also identified the "white spots" of missing design guidance needed by practitioners to handle the aforementioned challenges appropriately. We are currently evaluating our theory in the context of an action research study. In this study, we are also evaluating the novel design guidelines we are proposing in this regard, which, according to our theory, meet the needs of practitioners. Our design guidelines integrate with Domain-Driven Design, which is widely used in practice. Following the idea of multilevel serializability, we investigate the compatibility of business operations beyond commutativity. We provide concrete practical design guidance to achieve compatibility of non-commutative business operations. We also describe the basic infrastructure guarantees our design guidelines require from replication frameworks.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447865.3457969;;;Systems AND Control
Virtues of Patience in Strategic Queuing Systems;;;['Jason Gaitonde', 'Éva Tardos'];;;July 2021;;;EC '21: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Conference on Economics and Computation;;;We consider the problem of selfish agents in discrete-time queuing systems, where competitive queues try to get their packets served. In this model, a queue gets to send a packet each step to one of the servers, which will attempt to serve the oldest arriving packet, and unprocessed packets are returned to each queue. We model this as a repeated game where queues compete for the capacity of the servers, but where the state of the game evolves as the length of each queue varies, resulting in a highly dependent random process. In classical work for learning in repeated games, the learners evaluate the outcome of their strategy in each step---in our context, this means that queues estimate their success probability at each server. Earlier work by the authors [in EC'20] shows that with no-regret learners, the system needs twice the capacity as would be required in the coordinated setting to ensure queue lengths remain stable despite the selfish behavior of the queues. In this paper, we demonstrate that this myopic way of evaluating outcomes is suboptimal: if more patient queues choose strategies that selfishly maximize their long-run success rate, stability can be ensured with just e/e-1 ~1.58 times extra capacity, strictly better than what is possible assuming the no-regret property. As these systems induce highly dependent random processes, our analysis draws heavily on techniques from the theory of stochastic processes to establish various game-theoretic properties of these systems. Though these systems are random even under fixed stationary policies by the queues, we show using careful probabilistic arguments that surprisingly, under such fixed policies, these systems have essentially deterministic and explicit asymptotic behavior. We show that the growth rate of a set can be written as the ratio of a submodular and modular function, and use the resulting explicit description to show that the subsets of queues with largest growth rate are closed under union and non-disjoint intersections, which we use in turn to prove the claimed sharp bicriteria result for the equilibria of the resulting system. Our equilibrium analysis relies on a novel deformation argument towards a more analyzable solution that is quite different from classical price of anarchy bounds. While the intermediate points in this deformation will not be Nash, the structure will ensure the relevant constraints and incentives similarly hold to establish monotonicity along this continuous path.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465456.3467640;;;Systems AND Control
Programming Abstractions for Managing Workflows on Tiered Storage Systems;;;['Devarshi Ghoshal', 'Lavanya Ramakrishnan'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Storage;;;Scientific workflows in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments are processing large amounts of data. The storage hierarchy on HPC systems is getting deeper, driven by new technologies (NVRAMs, SSDs, etc.) There is a need for new programming abstractions that allow users to seamlessly manage data at the workflow level on multi-tiered storage systems, and provide optimal workflow performance and use of storage resources. In previous work, we introduced a software architecture Managing Data on Tiered Storage for Scientific Workflows (MaDaTS) that used a Virtual Data Space (VDS) abstraction to hide the complexities of the underlying storage system while allowing users to control data management strategies. In this article, we detail the data-centric programming abstractions that allow users to manage a workflow around its data on the storage layer. The programming abstractions simplify data management for scientific workflows on multi-tiered storage systems, without affecting workflow performance or storage capacity. We measure the overheads and effectiveness introduced by the programming abstractions of MaDaTS. Our results show that these abstractions can optimally use the storage capacity in lesser capacity storage tiers, and simplify data management without adding any performance overheads.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457119;;;Systems AND Control
You talkin' to me? Exploring Practical Attacks on Controller Pilot Data Link Communications;;;['Joshua Smailes', 'Daniel Moser', 'Matthew Smith', 'Martin Strohmeier', 'Vincent Lenders', 'Ivan Martinovic'];;;May 2021;;;CPSS '21: Proceedings of the 7th ACM on Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop;;;Worldwide, voice-based Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications are gradually being replaced with data link-based equivalents, namely the Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) system. This helps to manage the high levels of congestion on voice-based ATC---under modern traffic levels these analog voice channels are extremely busy, especially at times of peak traffic. CPDLC offers the ability to conduct most ATC actions in the form of digital text-based messages. As with voice-based ATC, CPDLC has no built-in security mechanisms. Furthermore, the links which carry CPDLC do not have security mechanisms either. In this paper, we analyze the susceptibility of CPDLC to attacks by a software-defined radio (SDR)-equipped attacker. Crucially, this is different to attacks on aviation surveillance systems, as it requires the attacker to comply with a larger authentication protocol. We identify attacks on CPDLC, including a man-in-the-middle attack on the protocol. This attack enables a take-over of an aircraft's communication on an attacker-specified frequency, after which arbitrary CPDLC commands can be transmitted to the target without alerting the legitimate controller. We empirically assess the likely effectiveness of this attack through a data collection and analysis exercise. In order to counteract this type of attack, we propose three countermeasures of different complexities, including logical checks and a public key infrastructure approach. We also estimate to what extent these countermeasures can be implemented without altering the underlying protocol.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457339.3457985;;;Systems AND Control
A Domain-Specific Language to Specify Planned Architectures of Adaptive Systems;;;['Daniel San Martín', 'Valter Camargo'];;;September 2021;;;SBCARS '21: Proceedings of the 15th Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse;;;Adaptive Systems (ASs) are able to monitor their own behavior and adapt it when quality goals are not accomplished. MAPE-K is a reference model that provides abstractions to design ASs. Structuring such systems with these abstractions brings many benefits, some related to maintenance and some related to comprehension of the architecture. However, many existing ASs are not designed according to MAPE-K, making those abstractions hidden in their architecture. Architectural Conformance Checking (ACC) is a technique for checking if the current architecture (CA) of a system is obeying the rules prescribed by a planned architecture (PA) or even by a reference model, like MAPE-K. In this paper we present DSL-Remedy, a language for specifying PAs in the context of Adaptive Systems. Our language provides adaptive-systems specific abstractions so that engineers can be more precise when describing the planned architecture. Besides, as our DSL is ASs-specific, it incorporates some rules already known in MAPE-K.

However, privacy is a major obstacle to the wide-spread use of such apps since users are concerned about sharing their contact and diagnosis data. This research overcomes multiple challenges facing contact tracing apps: (1) As researchers have pointed out, there is a need to balance contact tracing effectiveness with the amount of user identity and diagnosis information shared. (2) No matter what information the user chooses to share, the app should safeguard the privacy of user information. (3) On the other hand, some essential test result information must be shared for the contact tracing app to work. While contact tracing apps have done a good job maintaining contact information on the user’s device, most such apps publish positive COVID-19 test results to a central server which have some risks for compromise. We address these challenges by (1) giving the user the right to choose how much information to share about their diagnosis and their identity, (2) building our novel contact tracing app on top of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to assure privacy preserving user authentication with verifiable credentials, and (3) decentralizing the storage of COVID-19 test results. We, in collaboration with Verizon, have implemented our Privacy-preserving Contact Tracing (PpCT) app, leveraging SSI advances based on the blockchain for their 5G network.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486622.3493914;;;Systems AND Control
Towards instance-optimized data systems;;;['Tim Kraska'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment;;;In recent years, we have seen increased interest in applying machine learning to system problems. For example, there has been work on applying machine learning to improve query optimization, indexing, storage layouts, scheduling, log-structured merge trees, sorting, compression, and sketches, among many other data management tasks. Arguably, the ideas behind these techniques are similar: machine learning is used to model the data and/or workload in order to derive a more efficient algorithm or data structure. Ultimately, these techniques will allow us to build "instance-optimized" systems: that is, systems that self-adjust to a given workload and data distribution to provide unprecedented performance without the need for tuning by an administrator. While many of these techniques promise orders-of-magnitude better performance in lab settings, there is still general skepticism about how practical the current techniques really are.The following is intended as a progress report on ML for Systems and its readiness for real-world deployments, with a focus on our projects done as part of the Data Systems and AI Lab (DSAIL) at MIT By no means is it a comprehensive overview of all existing work, which has been steadily growing over the past several years not only in the database community but also in the systems, networking, theory, PL, and many other adjacent communities.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3476311.3476392;;;Systems AND Control
Model-Agnostic and Efficient Exploration of Numerical Congestion Control State Space of Real-World TCP Implementations;;;['Wei Sun', 'Lisong Xu', 'Sebastian Elbaum', 'Di Zhao'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;The significant impact of TCP congestion control on the Internet highlights the importance of testing congestion control algorithm implementations (CCAIs) in various network environments. Many CCAI testing problems can be solved by exploring the numerical state space of CCAIs, which is defined by a group of numerical (and nonnumerical) state variables of the CCAIs. However, the current practices for automated numerical state space exploration are either limited by the approximate abstract CCAI models or inefficient due to the large space of network environment parameters and the complicated relation between the CCAI states and network environment parameters. In this paper, we propose an automated numerical state space exploration method, called ACT, which leverages the model-agnostic feature of random testing and greatly improves its efficiency by guiding random testing under the feedback iteratively obtained in a test. Our experiments on five representative Linux TCP CCAIs show that ACT can more efficiently explore a large numerical state space than manual testing, undirected random testing, and symbolic execution based testing, while without requiring an abstract CCAI model. ACT detects multiple design and implementation bugs of these Linux TCP CCAIs, including some new bugs not reported before.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3078161;;;Systems AND Control
Continuous Operator Authentication for Teleoperated Systems Using Hidden Markov Models;;;['Junjie Yan', 'Kevin Huang', 'Kyle Lindgren', 'Tamara Bonaci', 'Howard J.

While HMMs were originally developed and widely used in speech recognition, they have shown great performance in human motion and activity modeling. We make an analogy between human language and teleoperated robotic processes (i.e., words are analogous to a teleoperator’s gestures, sentences are analogous to the entire teleoperated task or process) and implement HMMs to model the teleoperated task. To test the continuous authentication performance of the proposed method, we conducted two sets of analyses. We built a virtual reality (VR) experimental environment using a commodity VR headset (HTC Vive) and haptic feedback enabled controller (Sensable PHANToM Omni) to simulate a real teleoperated task. An experimental study with 10 subjects was then conducted. We also performed simulated continuous operator authentication by using the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). The performance of the model was evaluated based on the continuous (real-time) operator authentication accuracy as well as resistance to a simulated impersonation attack. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to achieve 70% (VR experiment) and 81% (JIGSAWS dataset) continuous classification accuracy with as short as a 1-second sample window. It is also capable of detecting an impersonation attack in real-time.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488901;;;Systems AND Control
Automated approach for system-level testing of unmanned aerial systems;;;['Hassan Sartaj'];;;November 2021;;;ASE '21: Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering;;;Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have a large number of applications in civil and military domains. UAS rely on various avionics systems that are safety-critical and mission-critical. A major requirement of international safety standards is to perform rigorous system-level testing of avionics systems, including software systems. The current industrial practice is to manually create test scenarios, manually or automatically execute these scenarios using simulators, and manual evaluation of the outcomes. A fundamental part of system-level testing of such systems is the simulation of environmental context. The test scenarios typically consist of setting certain environment conditions and testing the system under test in these settings. The state-of-the-art approaches available for this purpose also require manual test scenario development and manual test evaluation. In this research work, we propose an approach to automate the system-level testing of the UAS. The proposed approach (AITester) utilizes model-based testing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically generate, execute, and evaluate various test scenarios. The test scenarios are generated on the fly, i.e., during test execution based on the environmental context at runtime. We develop a toolset to support automation. We perform a pilot experiment using a widely-used open-source autopilot, ArduPilot. The preliminary results show that the AITester is effective and efficient in violating autopilot expected behavior.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678902;;;Systems AND Control

Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437959.3459254;;;Systems AND Control
An Evaluation Model of the Course of Electrical Control and PLC for Engineering Education Professional Certification;;;['Yang Zhao'];;;May 2021;;;CIPAE 2021: 2021 2nd International Conference on Computers, Information Processing and Advanced Education;;;The traditional engineering education pays too much attention to the scientific knowledge education based on subject knowledge in the course teaching, neglects the training of the ability of engineering practice and innovation, and leads to the serious separation of the students' knowledge and ability, and it is difficult to adapt to the demands of the creative talents of the engineering practice. The process of teaching of Electrical Control and PLC course in practical ability training is not enough in modern teaching methods of curriculum evaluation. The results oriented curriculum development theory put forward the reform of the teaching goal, the curriculum content, methods and assessment form. After the reform, the teaching plan of electronic technology is more suitable for the concept of international engineering education accreditation. The achievement oriented engineering education is goal oriented. It follows the principle of reverse design, determines the training target by the demand, then decides the graduation requirement by the training goal, and the course system and the course teaching by the requirements of the graduation.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3456887.3456917;;;Systems AND Control
Analysing Mission-critical Cyber-physical Systems with AND/OR Graphs and MaxSAT;;;['Martín Barrère', 'Chris Hankin'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) often involve complex networks of interconnected software and hardware components that are logically combined to achieve a common goal or mission; for example, keeping a plane in the air or providing energy to a city. Failures in these components may jeopardise the mission of the system. Therefore, identifying the minimal set of critical CPS components that is most likely to fail, and prevent the global system from accomplishing its mission, becomes essential to ensure reliability. In this article, we present a novel approach to identifying the Most Likely Mission-critical Component Set (MLMCS) using AND/OR dependency graphs enriched with independent failure probabilities. We address the MLMCS problem as a Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. We translate probabilities into a negative logarithmic space to linearise the problem within MaxSAT. The experimental results conducted with our open source tool LDA4CPS indicate that the approach is both effective and efficient. We also present a case study on complex aircraft systems that shows the feasibility of our approach and its applicability to mission-critical cyber-physical systems. Finally, we present two MLMCS-based security applications focused on system hardening and forensic investigations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3451169;;;Systems AND Control

AR in TV: Design and Evaluation of Mid-Air Gestures for Moderators to Control Augmented Reality Applications in TV;;;['Niloofar Samimi', 'Simon von der Au', 'Florian Weidner', 'Wolfgang Broll'];;;December 2021;;;MUM '21: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia;;;Recent developments in augmented reality for TV productions encouraged broadcasters to enhance interaction with virtual content for moderators. However, traditional interaction methods are considered distracting and not intuitive. To overcome these issues, we performed a gesture elicitation study with a follow-up evaluation. For this, we considered TV moderators as primary users of the gestures as well as viewers as recipients. The elicited gesture set consists of five gestures for two types of camera shots (long shot and close shot). Findings of the evaluation study indicate that the derived set of gestures requires low physical and concentration effort from moderators. Also, both moderators and viewers found them appropriate to be used in TV with respect to understandability, distraction, likeability, and appropriateness. Using these gestures would allow moderators to control AR content in TV and tell stories in a modern and more expressive way.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3490632.3490668;;;Systems AND Control
TRIPDECODER: Study Travel Time Attributes and Route Preferences of Metro Systems from Smart Card Data;;;['Xiancai Tian', 'Baihua Zheng', 'Yazhe Wang', 'Hsiao-Ting Huang', 'Chih-Chieh Hung'];;;None;;;ACM/IMS Transactions on Data Science;;;In this article, we target at recovering the exact routes taken by commuters inside a metro system that are not captured by an Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system and hence remain unknown. We strategically propose two inference tasks to handle the recovering, one to infer the travel time of each travel link that contributes to the total duration of any trip inside a metro network and the other to infer the route preferences based on historical trip records and the travel time of each travel link inferred in the previous inference task. As these two inference tasks have interrelationship, most of existing works perform these two tasks simultaneously. However, our solution TripDecoder adopts a totally different approach. TripDecoder fully utilizes the fact that there are some trips inside a metro system with only one practical route available. It strategically decouples these two inference tasks by only taking those trip records with only one practical route as the input for the first inference task of travel time and feeding the inferred travel time to the second inference task as an additional input, which not only improves the accuracy but also effectively reduces the complexity of both inference tasks. Two case studies have been performed based on the city-scale real trip records captured by the AFC systems in Singapore and Taipei to compare the accuracy and efficiency of TripDecoder and its competitors. As expected, TripDecoder has achieved the best accuracy in both datasets, and it also demonstrates its superior efficiency and scalability.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3430768;;;Systems AND Control

Examples of sCPS include modern traffic systems, Industry 4.0 systems, systems for smart buildings, and smart energy grids. The uniting aspect of all these systems is that to achieve their high level of intelligence, adaptivity and ability to optimize and learn, they rely heavily on software. This makes them software-intensive systems, where software becomes their most complex part. Engineering sCPS thus becomes a recognized software engineering discipline, which, due to specifics of sCPS, can only partially rely on the existing body of knowledge in software engineering. In fact, it turns out that many of the traditional approaches to architecture modeling and software development fall short in their ability to cope with the high dynamicity and uncertainty of sCPS. This calls for innovative approaches that jointly reflect and address the specifics of such systems. This paper maps the discussions and results of the Fourth International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS 2018), which focuses on challenges and promising solutions in the area of software engineering for sCPS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3364452.3364465;;;Systems AND Control
Security and Privacy of Patient Information in Medical Systems Based on Blockchain Technology;;;['Hongjiao Wu', 'Ashutosh Dhar Dwivedi', 'Gautam Srivastava'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications;;;The essence of “blockchain” is a shared database in which information stored is un-falsifiable, traceable, open, and transparent. Therefore, to improve the security of private information in medical systems, this article uses blockchain technology to design a method to protect private information in medical systems and effectively realize anti-theft control of private information. First, the Patient-oriented Privacy Preserving Access Control model is introduced into the access control process of private information in medical systems. Next, a private information storage platform is built by using blockchain technology, and information transmission is realized using standard cryptographic algorithms. In this process, file authorization contracts are also used to guarantee the security of private information and further prevent theft of medical private information. Our simulation results show that the storage response time of this method is kept below 1,000 ms, and the maximum information throughput rate reaches 550 kbit/s, which indicates that this method has strong performance in information storage and transmission efficiency. Moreover, the reliability and bandwidth utilization of data transmission across domains is higher, so the method has higher information security control performance and superior overall performance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408321;;;Systems AND Control

CPSs apply to a wide range of mission-critical applications that span from the intelligent management of logistics in complex supply chains, advanced manufacturing systems, and smart contracts, all the way to autonomous systems, and systems that support the smart interactions between humans and machines (M2H), or between machines (M2M). In this respect, the engineering of CPSs goes beyond existing Software Engineering concepts, tools, and techniques because of the very nature of CPSs that spans three realms (cyber, physical, social) and therefore needs to address requirements that span these realms. During the workshop, the participants discussed and debated techniques and directions in six main thematic areas on engineering Cyber-Physical Systems. These thematic areas deal with specification and modeling, DevOps processes for CPSs, data management and analytics, infrastructure and event handling, run-time adaptivity, and finally security, trust, and traceability.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3507788.3507844;;;Systems AND Control
Critical components identification for cyber-physical power systems considering time-varying operational states;;;['Yigu Liu', 'Ioannis Semertzis', 'Alexandria Stefanov', 'Peter Palensky'];;;May 2021;;;MSCPES '21: Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Modeling and Simulation of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems;;;The security issues of Cyber-Physical power Systems (CPS) have attracted widespread attention from scholars. Vulnerability assessment emerges as an effective method to identify the critical components and thus increase the system resilience. While efforts have been made to study the vulnerability features of power systems under the occurrence of a single, discrete disturbance or failure at a specific time instant, this paper focuses on identifying the critical components of the cyber-physical system considering time-varying operational states. To investigate the potentially ever-changing CPS vulnerability features, in this paper we construct a database of cascading failure chains using quasi-dynamic simulations to capture the vulnerability relationships among components under time-varying operational states. Then, by adopting sequential mining algorithms, we mine the most frequent cascading failure patterns and identify the critical components based on the data mining results. Simulation studies are conducted on IEEE 39-bus and IEEE RTS-96 systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the identification of critical components at both cyber and physical layers.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470481.3472702;;;Systems AND Control

Operating Systems for Resource-adaptive Intelligent Software: Challenges and Opportunities;;;['Xuanzhe Liu', 'Shangguang Wang', 'Yun Ma', 'Ying Zhang', 'Qiaozhu Mei', 'Yunxin Liu', 'Gang Huang'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Internet Technology;;;The past decades witnessed the fast and wide deployment of Internet. The Internet has bred the ubiquitous computing environment that is spanning the cloud, edge, mobile devices, and IoT. Software running over such a ubiquitous computing environment environment is eating the world. A recently emerging trend of Internet-based software systems is “resource adaptive,” i.e., software systems should be robust and intelligent enough to the changes of heterogeneous resources, both physical and logical, provided by their running environment. To keep pace of such a trend, we argue that some considerations should be taken into account for the future operating system design and implementation. From the structural perspective, rather than the “monolithic OS” that manages the aggregated resources on the single machine, the OS should be dynamically composed over the distributed resources and flexibly adapt to the resource and environment changes. Meanwhile, the OS should leverage advanced machine/deep learning techniques to derive configurations and policies and automatically learn to tune itself and schedule resources. This article envisions our recent thinking of the new OS abstraction, namely, ServiceOS, for future resource-adaptive intelligent software systems. The idea of ServiceOS is inspired by the delivery model of “Software-as-a-Service” that is supported by the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The key principle of ServiceOS is based on resource disaggregation, resource provisioning as a service, and learning-based resource scheduling and allocation. The major goal of this article is not providing an immediately deployable OS. Instead, we aim to summarize the challenges and potentially promising opportunities and try to provide some practical implications for researchers and practitioners.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3425866;;;Systems AND Control

A Simulation Software for the Evaluation of Vulnerabilities in Reputation Management Systems;;;['Vincenzo Agate', 'Alessandra De Paola', 'Giuseppe Lo Re', 'Marco Morana'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Computer Systems;;;Multi-agent distributed systems are characterized by autonomous entities that interact with each other to provide, and/or request, different kinds of services. In several contexts, especially when a reward is offered according to the quality of service, individual agents (or coordinated groups) may act in a selfish way. To prevent such behaviours, distributed Reputation Management Systems (RMSs) provide every agent with the capability of computing the reputation of the others according to direct past interactions, as well as indirect opinions reported by their neighbourhood. This last point introduces a weakness on gossiped information that makes RMSs vulnerable to malicious agents’ intent on disseminating false reputation values. Given the variety of application scenarios in which RMSs can be adopted, as well as the multitude of behaviours that agents can implement, designers need RMS evaluation tools that allow them to predict the robustness of the system to security attacks, before its actual deployment. To this aim, we present a simulation software for the vulnerability evaluation of RMSs and illustrate three case studies in which this tool was effectively used to model and assess state-of-the-art RMSs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458510;;;Systems AND Control

While question-answering systems enable people to easily articulate a why question (e.g., why students in Massachusetts have high ACT Math scores on average) and obtain an answer, these systems often produce questionable causal claims. To investigate how such claims might mislead users, we conducted two crowdsourced experiments to study the impact of showing different information on user perceptions of a question-answering system. We found that in a system that occasionally provided unreasonable responses, showing a scatterplot increased the plausibility of unreasonable causal claims. Also, simply warning participants that correlation is not causation seemed to lead participants to accept reasonable causal claims more cautiously. We observed a strong tendency among participants to associate correlation with causation. Yet, the warning appeared to reduce the tendency. Grounded in the findings, we propose ways to reduce the illusion of causality when using question-answering systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445444;;;Systems AND Control
One size does not fit all: security hardening of MIPS embedded systems via static binary debloating for shared libraries;;;['Haotian Zhang', 'Mengfei Ren', 'Yu Lei', 'Jiang Ming'];;;February 2022;;;ASPLOS '22: Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems;;;Embedded systems have become prominent targets for cyberattacks. To exploit firmware’s memory corruption vulnerabilities, cybercriminals harvest reusable code gadgets from the large shared library codebase (e.g., uClibc). Unfortunately, unlike their desktop counterparts, embedded systems lack essential computing resources to enforce security hardening techniques. Recently, we have witnessed a surge of software debloating as a new defense mechanism against code-reuse attacks; it erases unused code to significantly diminish the possibilities of constructing reusable gadgets. Because of the single firmware image update style, static library debloating shows promise to fortify embedded systems without compromising performance and forward compatibility. However, static library debloating on stripped binaries (e.g., firmware’s shared libraries) is still an enormous challenge. In this paper, we show that this challenge is not insurmountable for MIPS firmware. We develop a novel system, named uTrimmer, to identify and wipe out unused basic blocks from shared libraries’ binary code, without causing additional runtime overhead or memory consumption. We propose a new method to identify address-taken blocks/functions, which further help us maintain an inter-procedural control flow graph to conservatively include library code that could be potentially used by firmware. By capturing address access patterns for position-independent code, we circumvent the challenge of determining code-pointer targets and safely eliminate unused code. We run uTrimmer to debloat shared libraries for SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks, popular firmware applications (e.g., Apache, BusyBox, and OpenSSL), and a real-world wireless router firmware image. Our experiments show that not only does uTrimmer deliver functional programs, but also it can cut the exposed code surface and eliminate various reusable code gadgets remarkably. uTrimmer’s debloating capability can compete with the static linking results.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503222.3507768;;;Systems AND Control
Conceptualizing Hyperlocal Information Systems for Developing Countries;;;['Muzayun Mukhtar', 'Arjun Singh', 'Erin Arnesen', 'Saurabh Srivastava'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction;;;Hyperlocal information systems cater to the needs of the people in a well-defined geographical area. Such information systems are ubiquitously accessible to the users in the developed world through their mobile phones. In developing countries hyperlocal information is valued, but often dispersed, constantly evolving, and poorly accessible. Additionally, most of the social information systems in developing countries are adopted from the developed world, and often fail to take into consideration local socio-geographical settings and cultural complexities. As a result, there is a strong reliance on word of mouth through known and unknown networks. In this paper, we present foundational insights on user needs, behaviors and motivations for the design of hyperlocal information systems in developing countries based on a multi-year, multi-method research study with around 5000 participants in three such countries - India, Indonesia and Nigeria. We also discuss how the complexity of real-world sociocultural phenomena and heterogeneity of neighborhoods impact hyperlocal information, which can further inform design of such systems in the future.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479509;;;Systems AND Control

Fault Detection Method of Photovoltaic System Based on Power Change of Array;;;['Chao Tan', 'Chenxi Li', 'Kanjian Zhang', 'Haikun Wei'];;;December 2021;;;ACAI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 4th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence;;;The fault detection of photovoltaic power generation system is of great significance in photovoltaic plant management. The conventional fault detection method of photovoltaic power system requires additional sensors, and the fault detection scheme needs to be redesigned if the parameters of the photovoltaic plant change. Therefore, for large photovoltaic plants, it is necessary to develop a method that does not require the use of external sensors or the detailed parameters of the photovoltaic plant. This paper proposes a photovoltaic system fault detection method based on photovoltaic array current and voltage data. This method does not require additional sensor data such as irradiance and temperature. The failure of photovoltaic system can be detected through the change of power, and the abnormal situation of photovoltaic power station can still be detected under cloudy and shaded conditions. The advantages of this method are that there is no need for complex and diverse sensor equipment, the calculation is simple and the fault detection ability is accurate.

Thermal-aware Adaptive Platform Management for Heterogeneous Embedded Systems;;;['Srijeeta Maity', 'Anirban Ghose', 'Soumyajit Dey', 'Swarnendu Biswas'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Recent trends in real-time applications have raised the demand for high-throughput embedded platforms with integrated CPU-GPU based Systems-On-Chip (SoCs). The enhanced performance of such SoCs, however, comes at the cost of increased power consumption, resulting in significant heat dissipation and high on-chip temperatures. The prolonged occurrences of high on-chip temperature can cause accelerated in-circuit ageing, which severely degrades the long-term performance and reliability of the chip. Violation of thermal constraints leads to on-board dynamic thermal management kicking-in, which may result in timing unpredictability for real-time tasks due to transient performance degradation. Recent work in adaptive software design have explored this issue from a control theoretic stand-point, striving for smooth thermal envelopes by tuning the core frequency.Existing techniques do not handle thermal violations for periodic real-time task sets in the presence of dynamic events like change of task periodicity, more so in the context of heterogeneous SoCs with integrated CPU-GPUs. This work presents an OpenCL runtime extension for thermal-aware scheduling of periodic, real-time tasks on heterogeneous multi-core platforms. Our framework mitigates dynamic thermal violations by adaptively tuning task mapping parameters, with the eventual control objective of satisfying both platform-level thermal constraints and task-level deadline constraints. We consider multiple platform-level control actions like task migration, frequency tuning and idle slot insertion as the task mapping parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers such a variety of task mapping control actions in the context of heterogeneous embedded platforms. We evaluate the proposed framework on an Odroid-XU4 board using OpenCL benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing thermal violations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477028;;;Systems AND Control
Blockchain-based cyber-physical systems security autonomous routing scheme;;;['Yasheng Zhang', 'Chengcheng Li', 'Chao Wang', 'Peiying Zhang'];;;December 2021;;;UCC '21: Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion;;;Improving the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for users of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the key to the widespread promotion and deployment of this technology. Network latency is an important factor affecting users' network experience. Due to the limited processing capacity of a single device node of CPS, the communication relationship between equipment is extremely complicated, and multi-hop device nodes may be passed through in the middle, so designing an efficient routing scheme for CPS is a serious challenge. CPS routing also faces a security crisis. System nodes may send viruses or erroneous results to user equipment, and user equipment may also refuse to pay for routing services to system nodes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a secure routing scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is used to ensure secure transactions between system nodes and user equipment. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is used, and two deep neural networks are used to train intelligent agent to achieve low-latency adaptive traffic scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed autonomous routing technology can reduce the system communication latency by about 31.7%-45.4%.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492323.3495619;;;Systems AND Control
Utilizing textual reviews in latent factor models for recommender systems;;;['Tatev Karen Aslanyan', 'Flavius Frasincar'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;Most of the existing recommender systems are based only on the rating data, and they ignore other sources of information that might increase the quality of recommendations, such as textual reviews, or user and item characteristics. Moreover, the majority of those systems are applicable only on small datasets (with thousands of observations) and are unable to handle large datasets (with millions of observations). We propose a recommender algorithm that combines a rating modelling technique (i.e., Latent Factor Model) with a topic modelling method based on textual reviews (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation), and we extend the algorithm such that it allows adding extra user- and item-specific information to the system. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using Amazon.com datasets with different sizes, corresponding to 23 product categories. After comparing the built model to four other models we found that combining textual reviews with ratings leads to better recommendations. Moreover, we found that adding extra user and item features to the model increases its prediction accuracy, which is especially true for medium and large datasets.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3442065;;;Systems AND Control

User-centered Evaluation of Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems;;;['Himan Abdollahpouri', 'Masoud Mansoury', 'Robin Burke', 'Bamshad Mobasher', 'Edward Malthouse'];;;June 2021;;;UMAP '21: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization;;;Recommendation and ranking systems are known to suffer from popularity bias; the tendency of the algorithm to favor a few popular items while under-representing the majority of other items. Prior research has examined various approaches for mitigating popularity bias and enhancing the recommendation of long-tail, less popular, items. The effectiveness of these approaches is often assessed using different metrics to evaluate the extent to which over-concentration on popular items is reduced. However, not much attention has been given to the user-centered evaluation of this bias; how different users with different levels of interest towards popular items are affected by such algorithms. In this paper, we show the limitations of the existing metrics to evaluate popularity bias mitigation when we want to assess these algorithms from the users’ perspective and we propose a new metric that can address these limitations. In addition, we present an effective approach that mitigates popularity bias from the user-centered point of view. Finally, we investigate several state-of-the-art approaches proposed in recent years to mitigate popularity bias and evaluate their performances using the existing metrics and also from the users’ perspective. Our experimental results using two publicly-available datasets show that existing popularity bias mitigation techniques ignore the users’ tolerance towards popular items. Our proposed user-centered method can tackle popularity bias effectively for different users while also improving the existing metrics.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450613.3456821;;;Systems AND Control

This research aims at designing an improved process for evaluating e-government services in Rwanda, a least developed country pursuing ambitious digitalization. The research draws on the information systems artifact (ISA) model, which considers alignment between technology, information, and social context as the key to successful technology-based innovation, and all three aspects as artifacts, subject to design. We build a prototype technical artifact and suggest an information and a social one. The ambition is making the currently control-based summative evaluation process more cooperative and inclusive of both service providers and users. The new design uses feedback from users to allow service providers and monitoring organizations to conduct also formative evaluations in order to be able to better align service processes with user needs and behavior and thereby make them more attractive and more used. The prototype “Rwanda Online Service Evaluation” (ROSE) was tested through semi-structured interviews with senior managers in six Rwandan organizations, and through an online user survey (n= 60). The findings can guide decision makers and practitioners involved with e-government design and evaluation. As a contribution to research, the research shows the usefulness of the ISA model for communicating the design of technology aiming at comprehensive process change.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494193.3494304;;;Systems AND Control

Reconfigurable Nonuniform Filter Bank for Hearing Aid Systems;;;['Tong Ma', 'Ying Wei', 'Xin Lou'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing;;;Filter banks with good reconfigurability are desired in hearing aid systems due to the individual requirements of patients with different hearing loss characteristics. This paper proposes a modularized design approach of a completely reconfigurable nonuniform filter bank for hearing aid systems. The proposed filter bank structure consists of a multiband generation module and a subband extraction module, where the frequency warping technique is adopted. Based on theoretical analyses of second order frequency warping, the subband distribution can be flexibly controlled. Moreover, to adapt the subband extraction module design to the multiband generation module, the relationship between control parameters is analyzed and a mapping formula is derived. Through the co-design of the two modules, superior reconfigurability over existing methods is achieved. Application examples show that the proposed filter bank is able to provide multiple subbands distribution schemes that satisfy the requirements of different audiograms. The proposed filter bank structure has lower complexity, smaller delay and smaller matching errors than existing filter bank structures due to its flexible structure.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TASLP.2021.3138713;;;Systems AND Control

However, due to the increasing complexity of CPSs and more sophisticated attacks, conventional anomaly detection methods, which face the growing volume of data and need domain-specific knowledge, cannot be directly applied to address these challenges. To this end, deep learning-based anomaly detection (DLAD) methods have been proposed. In this article, we review state-of-the-art DLAD methods in CPSs. We propose a taxonomy in terms of the type of anomalies, strategies, implementation, and evaluation metrics to understand the essential properties of current methods. Further, we utilize this taxonomy to identify and highlight new characteristics and designs in each CPS domain. Also, we discuss the limitations and open problems of these methods. Moreover, to give users insights into choosing proper DLAD methods in practice, we experimentally explore the characteristics of typical neural models, the workflow of DLAD methods, and the running performance of DL models. Finally, we discuss the deficiencies of DL approaches, our findings, and possible directions to improve DLAD methods and motivate future research.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453155;;;Systems AND Control

This business environment makes it difficult to solve the problem of the availability of reliable information that can be used to make management decisions. In such situation, the results can be achieved using the principles of end-to-end, unified management of the entire industrial enterprise. These principles make it possible to optimize the available resources and achieve the planned results using digital monitoring systems of industrial enterprises. This makes relevant the research in the field of their development. The purpose of this work is to develop the structural and functional model of a digital monitoring system for an enterprise in Industry 4.0. The paper gives the definition of the digital monitoring system. This work also identifies the goals of industrial enterprises that can be achieved through the introduction of digital production monitoring systems. Based on the identified tasks, the characteristics of the digital monitoring system have been determined. The structural and functional model of the digital monitoring system has been developed. The assessment of the impact of the digital monitoring system on improving the efficiency of the enterprise has been carried out. The work was based on the materials of the practical industrial conference "Effective Production 4.0", which was held online in 2021 and attracted the leaders of the industrial industry.

As the number of antennas increases, the computational complexity grows dramatically, and this involves matrix calculations with complex numbers. We have designed and implemented a general matrix arithmetic processor to accelerate these calculations, including matrix multiplication, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and QR decomposition, on an FPGA. The design can be implemented in fixed-point or single-precision floating-point depending on the requirements of the application. The system behavior can be controlled by instructions such as elementary multiplication, rotation and vector projection, which allows the system to work as a coprocessor in a baseband System on a Chip (SoC). Latency for changing from one matrix computation to another is just a few clock cycles, providing the low latency required for edge processing. The design is implemented and verified on the Xilinx RFSoC development board using fixed point and single precision floating point numbers and matrix sizes of 8 × 8 and 16 × 16.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468044.3468050;;;Systems AND Control

Critiquing for Music Exploration in Conversational Recommender Systems;;;['Wanling Cai', 'Yucheng Jin', 'Li Chen'];;;April 2021;;;IUI '21: 26th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces;;;Dialogue-based conversational recommender systems allow users to give language-based feedback on the recommended item, which has great potential for supporting users to explore the space of recommendations through conversation. In this work, we consider incorporating critiquing techniques into conversational systems to facilitate users’ exploration of music recommendations. Thus, we have developed a music chatbot with three system variants, which are respectively featured with three different critiquing techniques, i.e., user-initiated critiquing (UC), progressive system-suggested critiquing (Progressive SC), and cascading system-suggested critiquing (Cascading SC). We conducted a between-subject study (N=107) to compare these three types of systems with regards to music exploration in terms of user perception and user interaction. Results show that both UC and SC are useful for music exploration, while users perceive higher diversity of recommendations with the system that offers Cascading SC and perceive more serendipitous with the system that offers Progressive SC. In addition, we find that the critiquing techniques significantly moderate the relationships between some interaction metrics (e.g., number of listened songs, number of dialogue turns) and users’ perceived helpfulness and serendipity during music exploration.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3397481.3450657;;;Systems AND Control
LIMA: Fine-grained Lineage Tracing and Reuse in Machine Learning Systems;;;['Arnab Phani', 'Benjamin Rath', 'Matthias Boehm'];;;June 2021;;;SIGMOD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data;;;Machine learning (ML) and data science workflows are inherently exploratory. Data scientists pose hypotheses, integrate the necessary data, and run ML pipelines of data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning. The repetitive nature of these workflows, and their hierarchical composition from building blocks exhibits high computational redundancy. Existing work addresses this redundancy with coarse-grained lineage tracing and reuse for ML pipelines. This approach allows using existing ML systems, but views entire algorithms as black boxes, and thus, fails to eliminate fine-grained redundancy and to handle internal non-determinism. In this paper, we introduce LIMA, a practical framework for efficient, fine-grained lineage tracing and reuse inside ML systems. Lineage tracing of individual operations creates new challenges and opportunities. We address the large size of lineage traces with multi-level lineage tracing and reuse, as well as lineage deduplication for loops and functions; exploit full and partial reuse opportunities across the program hierarchy; and integrate this framework with task parallelism and operator fusion. The resulting framework performs fine-grained lineage tracing with low overhead, provides versioning and reproducibility, and is able to eliminate fine-grained redundancy. Our experiments on a variety of ML pipelines show performance improvements up to 12.4x.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3452788;;;Systems AND Control

Automation, teamwork, and the feared loss of safety: Air traffic controllers’ experiences and expectations on current and future ATM systems;;;['Åsa Svensson', 'Jonas Lundberg', 'Camilla Forsell', 'Niklas Rönnberg'];;;April 2021;;;ECCE '21: Proceedings of the 32nd European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics;;;In various control systems, automation is implemented to increase efficiency and safety. With increased automation, it becomes increasingly relevant to view the automation as a team member, rather than as a tool. In best cases, human-automation teamwork keeps workload within acceptable limits, increase situation awareness, and keeps the operator in the control loop. However, human-automation teamwork will only flourish if the automation is developed with the human operator in mind. Therefore, investigations of the current experiences and expectations regarding automation and teamwork are important for the development of automation. Through a questionnaire among Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs), the present study aims to investigate how ATCOs perceive automation and safety in current and future air traffic control systems and the importance of different teamwork factors for human-human and human-automation collaboration. The results indicate that the ATCOs believe that safety will increase in the future along with increasing automation as long as the automation is working as expected. The ATCOs expressed a fear of deskilling and losing situation awareness with automation, a fear associated with a new ATCO role of monitoring the system and take over when the automation fails. The results suggest that design for human-automation teamwork aspects that ATCOs value, such as adaptability or mutual performance monitoring, could be a way forward.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3452853.3452855;;;Systems AND Control

Meta-Learning to Improve Unsupervised Intrusion Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Tommaso Zoppi', 'Mohamad Gharib', 'Muhammad Atif', 'Andrea Bondavalli'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based classifiers rely on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to provide functionalities that system architects are often willing to integrate into critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). However, such algorithms may misclassify observations, with potential detrimental effects on the system itself or on the health of people and of the environment. In addition, CPSs may be subject to threats that were not previously known, motivating the need for building Intrusion Detectors (IDs) that can effectively deal with zero-day attacks. Different studies were directed to compare misclassifications of various algorithms to identify the most suitable one for a given system. Unfortunately, even the most suitable algorithm may still show an unsatisfactory number of misclassifications when system requirements are strict. A possible solution may rely on the adoption of meta-learners, which build ensembles of base-learners to reduce misclassifications and that are widely used for supervised learning. Meta-learners have the potential to reduce misclassifications with respect to non-meta learners: however, misleading base-learners may let the meta-learner leaning towards misclassifications and therefore their behavior needs to be carefully assessed through empirical evaluation. To such extent, in this paper we investigate, expand, empirically evaluate, and discuss meta-learning approaches that rely on ensembles of unsupervised algorithms to detect (zero-day) intrusions in CPSs. Our experimental comparison is conducted by means of public datasets belonging to network intrusion detection and biometric authentication systems, which are common IDSs for CPSs. Overall, we selected 21 datasets, 15 unsupervised algorithms and 9 different meta-learning approaches. Results allow discussing the applicability and suitability of meta-learning for unsupervised anomaly detection, comparing metric scores achieved by base algorithms and meta-learners. Analyses and discussion end up showing how the adoption of meta-learners significantly reduces misclassifications when detecting (zero-day) intrusions in CPSs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3467470;;;Systems AND Control
How Can Digital Games Recommender Systems Improve for Their Content Creators;;;['Marta Kholodylo', 'Christine Strauss'];;;November 2021;;;iiWAS2021: The 23rd International Conference on Information Integration and Web Intelligence;;;Electronic recommender systems serve as a vital component in digital distribution channels in the video games industry.

The approach adopts a context-free grammar to determine the behaviour rule syntax. This allows for flexibility in evolving task allocation under multiple and dynamic constraints without manual rule design and parameter tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted with a target discovery simulation illustrate that the grammar-based model performs successfully in both dynamic and non-dynamic conditions. A statistically significant performance improvement is shown compared to an algorithm developed with the broadcast of local eligibility mechanism and a genetic programming mechanism. Grammatical evolution can achieve near-optimal solutions under restrictions applied on the number of agents, targets and the time allowed. Further, analysis of the evolved rule structures shows that grammatical evolution can identify less complex rule structures for behaviours while maintaining the expected level of performance. The results infer that the proposed model is a promising alternative for dynamic task allocation with human interactions in complex real-world domains.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472306.3478337;;;Systems AND Control
Code-size-aware Scheduling of Synchronous Dataflow Graphs on Multicore Systems;;;['Mingze Ma', 'Rizos Sakellariou'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Synchronous dataflow graphs are widely used to model digital signal processing and multimedia applications.

Based on this communication-aware self-timed execution approach, four communication-aware scheduling algorithms are proposed using different allocation rules. Furthermore, a code-size-aware mapping heuristic is proposed and jointly used with a proposed scheduling algorithm to reduce the code size of SDFGs on multicore systems. The proposed scheduling algorithms are experimentally evaluated and found to perform better than existing algorithms in terms of throughput and runtime for several applications. The experiments also show that the proposed code-size-aware mapping approach can achieve significant code size reduction with limited throughput degradation in most cases.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3440034;;;Systems AND Control

Due to the problem of data isolation and the requirement of high model performance, many applications in industry call for building a secure and efficient LR model for multiple parties. Most existing work uses either Homomorphic Encryption (HE) or Secret Sharing (SS) to build secure LR. HE based methods can deal with high-dimensional sparse features, but they incur potential security risks. SS based methods have provable security, but they have efficiency issue under high-dimensional sparse features. In this paper, we first present CAESAR, which combines HE and SS to build secure large-scale sparse logistic regression model and achieves both efficiency and security. We then present the distributed implementation of CAESAR for scalability requirement. We have deployed CAESAR in a risk control task and conducted comprehensive experiments.

Uncertainty in Self-adaptive Systems: A Research Community Perspective;;;['Sara M. Hezavehi', 'Danny Weyns', 'Paris Avgeriou', 'Radu Calinescu', 'Raffaela Mirandola', 'Diego Perez-Palacin'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems;;;One of the primary drivers for self-adaptation is ensuring that systems achieve their goals regardless of the uncertainties they face during operation. Nevertheless, the concept of uncertainty in self-adaptive systems is still insufficiently understood. Several taxonomies of uncertainty have been proposed, and a substantial body of work exists on methods to tame uncertainty. Yet, these taxonomies and methods do not fully convey the research community’s perception on what constitutes uncertainty in self-adaptive systems and on the key characteristics of the approaches needed to tackle uncertainty. To understand this perception and learn from it, we conducted a survey comprising two complementary stages in which we collected the views of 54 and 51 participants, respectively. In the first stage, we focused on current research and development, exploring how the concept of uncertainty is understood in the community and how uncertainty is currently handled in the engineering of self-adaptive systems. In the second stage, we focused on directions for future research to identify potential approaches to dealing with unanticipated changes and other open challenges in handling uncertainty in self-adaptive systems. The key findings of the first stage are: (a) an overview of uncertainty sources considered in self-adaptive systems, (b) an overview of existing methods used to tackle uncertainty in concrete applications, (c) insights into the impact of uncertainty on non-functional requirements, (d) insights into different opinions in the perception of uncertainty within the community and the need for standardised uncertainty-handling processes to facilitate uncertainty management in self-adaptive systems. The key findings of the second stage are: (a) the insight that over 70% of the participants believe that self-adaptive systems can be engineered to cope with unanticipated change, (b) a set of potential approaches for dealing with unanticipated change, (c) a set of open challenges in mitigating uncertainty in self-adaptive systems, in particular in those with safety-critical requirements. From these findings, we outline an initial reference process to manage uncertainty in self-adaptive systems. We anticipate that the insights on uncertainty obtained from the community and our proposed reference process will inspire valuable future research on self-adaptive systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487921;;;Systems AND Control
Data-Centric Explanations: Explaining Training Data of Machine Learning Systems to Promote Transparency;;;['Ariful Islam Anik', 'Andrea Bunt'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;Training datasets fundamentally impact the performance of machine learning (ML) systems. Any biases introduced during training (implicit or explicit) are often reflected in the system's behaviors leading to questions about fairness and loss of trust in the system. Yet, information on training data is rarely communicated to stakeholders. In this work, we explore the concept of data-centric explanations for ML systems that describe the training data to end-users. Through a formative study, we investigate the potential utility of such an approach, including the information about training data that participants find most compelling. In a second study, we investigate reactions to our explanations across four different system scenarios.

Therefore, researchers have endeavored towards the design of various heuristic solution generation techniques both for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous computing platforms. Traditionally, list scheduling heuristics are known to generate efficient schedules within reasonable time complexities. In this research work, we first focus on a makespan minimizing DAG scheduler for heterogeneous distributed systems. Secondly, we also formulated a problem, which is an extension of the first work, by considering a real-time application on a heterogeneous platform. We proposed an algorithm, named PRESTO that aims to minimize a generic penalty function while satisfying the resource, precedence and timing constraints.

Consequently, application runtime variability and suboptimal system utilization are observed in production systems. To address these problems, we propose Netscope, a congestion mitigation framework based on a novel delay sensitivity metric. Delay sensitivity of an application is used to quantify the impact of congestion on its runtime. Netscope uses delay sensitivity estimates to drive a congestion mitigation mechanism to selectively throttle applications that are less susceptible to congestion. We evaluate Netscope on two Cray Aries systems, including a production supercomputer, on common scientific applications. Our evaluation shows that Netscope has a low training cost and accurately estimates the impact of congestion on application runtime with a correlation between 0.7 and 0.9. Moreover, Netscope reduces application tail runtime increase by up to 16.3x while improving the median system utility by 12%.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447818.3460362;;;Systems AND Control
Lightweight Delegated Authentication with Identity Fraud Detection for Cyber-physical Systems;;;['Zheng Yang', 'Chao Yin', 'Chenglu Jin', 'Jianting Ning', 'Jianying Zhou'];;;May 2021;;;CPSS '21: Proceedings of the 7th ACM on Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop;;;Delegated authentication is a very popular and effective paradigm to deal with entity authentication problems for resource-constrained clients in cyber-physical systems; namely, the authentication between two clients is proxied by a trusted authentication server. However, an attacker may compromise the authentication server to impersonate the clients for sabotaging the cyber-physical systems. To detect the identity fraud attacks caused by an authentication server compromise, we propose two mutual authentication protocols by using a pseudo-random function family and a one-time signature (OTS) scheme. Our idea is to leverage the continuously evolving OTS signing and verifying keys at the signer and the verifier sides respectively for identity fraud detection because an identity fraud attack would violate the victim's honest OTS key update procedure. The proposed protocols are proven secure under a new mutual authentication security model that formulates the identity fraud detection.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457339.3457984;;;Systems AND Control

The cleanings of gutters and drains are banned by the Government of India because the deployment of human labor inside the drain is risky due to a lot of waste/chemicals in the garbage. Due to a lot of waste and other objects, the drains are choked, and eventually blocking off the drain occurs. This leads to overflow in many cases. Considering these aspects, a novel design of an IoT (Internet-of-thing) automated inspection robotic system is proposed here. This system consists of 6 wheels robotic system along with one wireless camera, a suction leaf collection system, and one slurry suction pump. In this six-wheel robotic system, the front two-wheel of the robotic system is used to give the turning movement and the back four wheels will give the forward and backward movement, which are run by DC motors. The robot and wireless camera are controlled using IoT Technique where mobile apps are developed. Subsequently, these data can also be visualized in mobile through Web/Android phone applications.

A Hybrid Approach for Offline A/B Evaluation for Item Ranking Algorithms in Recommendation Systems;;;['Prabhat Kumar Saraswat', 'Samuel William', 'Eswar Reddy'];;;October 2021;;;AIMLSystems '21: Proceedings of the First International Conference on AI-ML Systems;;;A recommendation system generally outputs a ranked list of items which is presented to the user. Based on the consumption signals from the user (like click, play) in an production environment, various performance metrics like Click Through Rate (CTR), Play Through Rate (PTR), Average Consumption Time etc. are calculated. These metrics are used to objectively evaluate performance of various underlying algorithms (policies) using Online A/B tests. However, if there are many such policies in the innovation pipeline, evaluating them using Online A/B puts significant overhead on production systems and can cause user dissatisfaction if a poor policy is exposed to them. Therefore, pre-production testing in an offline environment has become a highly researched area of significant practical value. During ”offline A/B” testing, we are interested in comparing multiple policies based on their potential improvement towards the performance metrics which are most correlated with business KPIs. On the other hand, user’s satisfaction is also closely related to the ranked occurrence of items, i.e., the relevant items should occur towards the top of the list. Current well known methods based on counterfactual estimation such as importance sampling and its variants capped importance sampling, normalized capped importance sampling consider only a single performance metric for evaluation and do not consider the user-satisfaction metrics, which could lead to sub-optimal user experience. Further the position bias due to limited real-estate on mobile devices is not considered. To solve these issues, we extend the importance sampling based methods by combining both performance and user satisfaction metrics along with accounting for position bias. We also demonstrate that using such a hybrid metric during offline testing leads to improved correlation with desired business metrics, thus enabling better offline comparison of ranking algorithms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486001.3486241;;;Systems AND Control
Lucid: a language for control in the data plane;;;['John Sonchack', 'Devon Loehr', 'Jennifer Rexford', 'David Walker'];;;August 2021;;;SIGCOMM '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGCOMM 2021 Conference;;;Programmable switch hardware makes it possible to move fine-grained control logic inside the network data plane, improving performance for a wide range of applications. However, applications with integrated control are inherently hard to write in existing data-plane programming languages such as P4. This paper presents Lucid, a language that raises the level of abstraction for putting control functionality in the data plane. Lucid introduces abstractions that make it easy to write sophisticated data-plane applications with interleaved packet-handling and control logic, specialized type and syntax systems that prevent programmer bugs related to data-plane state, and an open-sourced compiler that translates Lucid programs into P4 optimized for the Intel Tofino. These features make Lucid general and easy to use, as we demonstrate by writing a suite of ten different data-plane applications in Lucid. Working prototypes take well under an hour to write, even for a programmer without prior Tofino experience, have around 10x fewer lines of code compared to P4, and compile efficiently to real hardware. In a stateful firewall written in Lucid, we find that moving control from a switch's CPU to its data-plane processor using Lucid reduces the latency of performance-sensitive operations by over 300X.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3452296.3472903;;;Systems AND Control
Software Hint-Driven Data Management for Hybrid Memory in Mobile Systems;;;['Fei Wen', 'Mian Qin', 'Paul Gratz', 'Narasimha Reddy'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Hybrid memory systems, comprised of emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) and DRAM, have been proposed to address the growing memory demand of current mobile applications. Recently emerging NVM technologies, such as phase-change memories (PCM), memristor, and 3D XPoint, have higher capacity density, minimal static power consumption and lower cost per GB. However, NVM has longer access latency and limited write endurance as opposed to DRAM. The different characteristics of distinct memory classes render a new challenge for memory system design.Ideally, pages should be placed or migrated between the two types of memories according to the data objects’ access properties. Prior system software approaches exploit the program information from OS but at the cost of high software latency incurred by related kernel processes. Hardware approaches can avoid these latencies, however, hardware’s vision is constrained to a short time window of recent memory requests, due to the limited on-chip resources.In this work, we propose OpenMem: a hardware-software cooperative approach that combines the execution time advantages of pure hardware approaches with the data object properties in a global scope. First, we built a hardware-based memory manager unit (HMMU) that can learn the short-term access patterns by online profiling, and execute data migration efficiently. Then, we built a heap memory manager for the heterogeneous memory systems that allows the programmer to directly customize each data object’s allocation to a favorable memory device within the presumed object life cycle. With the programmer’s hints guiding the data placement at allocation time, data objects with similar properties will be congregated to reduce unnecessary page migrations.We implemented the whole system on the FPGA board with embedded ARM processors. In testing under a set of benchmark applications from SPEC 2017 and PARSEC, experimental results show that OpenMem reduces 44.6% energy consumption with only a 16% performance degradation compared to the all-DRAM memory system. The amount of writes to the NVM is reduced by 14% versus the HMMU-only, extending the NVM device lifetime.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494536;;;Systems AND Control
Adversarial attacks to API recommender systems: time to wake up and smell the coffee?;;;['Phuong T. Nguyen', 'Claudio Di Sipio', 'Juri Di Rocco', 'Massimiliano Di Penta', 'Davide Di Ruscio'];;;November 2021;;;ASE '21: Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering;;;Recommender systems in software engineering provide developers with a wide range of valuable items to help them complete their tasks. Among others, API recommender systems have gained momentum in recent years as they became more successful at suggesting API calls or code snippets. While these systems have proven to be effective in terms of prediction accuracy, there has been less attention for what concerns such recommenders' resilience against adversarial attempts. In fact, by crafting the recommenders' learning material, e.g., data from large open-source software (OSS) repositories, hostile users may succeed in injecting malicious data, putting at risk the software clients adopting API recommender systems. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation of adversarial machine learning techniques and their possible influence on recommender systems. The evaluation performed on three state-of-the-art API recommender systems reveals a worrying outcome: all of them are not immune to malicious data. The obtained result triggers the need for effective countermeasures to protect recommender systems against hostile attacks disguised in training data.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678946;;;Systems AND Control
Falsification of Hybrid Systems Using Adaptive Probabilistic Search;;;['Gidon Ernst', 'Sean Sedwards', 'Zhenya Zhang', 'Ichiro Hasuo'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation;;;We present and analyse an algorithm that quickly finds falsifying inputs for hybrid systems. Our method is based on a probabilistically directed tree search, whose distribution adapts to consider an increasingly fine-grained discretization of the input space. In experiments with standard benchmarks, our algorithm shows comparable or better performance to existing techniques, yet it does not build an explicit model of a system. Instead, at each decision point within a single trial, it makes an uninformed probabilistic choice between simple strategies to extend the input signal by means of exploration or exploitation. Key to our approach is the way input signal space is decomposed into levels, such that coarse segments are more probable than fine segments. We perform experiments to demonstrate how and why our approach works, finding that a fully randomized exploration strategy performs as well as our original algorithm that exploits robustness. We propose this strategy as a new baseline for falsification and conclude that more discriminative benchmarks are required.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459605;;;Systems AND Control

The purpose of this paper is to use machine learning (ML) technology to build an effective risk control model, so as to help Internet finance enterprises better control the loan risk. Sample data of Internet financial platform borrowers are extracted from multiple dimensions, and then the data are further processed, and the data used to build the model is extracted by feature engineering. Combined with the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm in ML algorithm, the comprehensive evaluation is carried out by using the basic information of bank customers, flow records, user detection information and user detection scale.

Time Series Anomaly Detection for Cyber-physical Systems via Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering;;;['Cheng Feng', 'Pengwei Tian'];;;August 2021;;;KDD '21: Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining;;;Recent advances in AIoT technologies have led to an increasing popularity of utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect operational failures for cyber-physical systems (CPS). In its basic form, an anomaly detection module monitors the sensor measurements and actuator states from the physical plant, and detects anomalies in these measurements to identify abnormal operation status. Nevertheless, building effective anomaly detection models for CPS is rather challenging as the model has to accurately detect anomalies in presence of highly complicated system dynamics and unknown amount of sensor noise. In this work, we propose a novel time series anomaly detection method called Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering (NSIBF) in which a specially crafted neural network architecture is posed for system identification, i.e., capturing the dynamics of CPS in a dynamical state-space model; then a Bayesian filtering algorithm is naturally applied on top of the "identified" state-space model for robust anomaly detection by tracking the uncertainty of the hidden state of the system recursively over time. We provide qualitative as well as quantitative experiments with the proposed method on a synthetic and three real-world CPS datasets, showing that NSIBF compares favorably to the state-of-the-art methods with considerable improvements on anomaly detection in CPS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447548.3467137;;;Systems AND Control
Better atomic writes by exposing the flash out-of-band area to file systems;;;['Hongwei Qin', 'Dan Feng', 'Wei Tong', 'Yutong Zhao', 'Sheng Qiu', 'Fei Liu', 'Shu Li'];;;June 2021;;;LCTES 2021: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems;;;File systems for mobile devices usually preserve data consistency by ordered I/Os. However, maintaining I/O ordering prevents applications from fully exploiting device parallelism and thus degrades the storage performance. In this paper, we propose NBStack to eliminate ordered I/Os without compromising data consistency. First, we augment the existing block interface to expose the Flash out-of-band area to file systems. Second, we build an enhanced block device prototype that supports the new interface. Third, we develop NBFS, a Linux file system, that leverages the new block interface to achieve atomic writes without enforcing I/O orderings. Experimental results show that NBStack doubles the performance of F2FS while providing strong consistency and durability guarantees. If applications are willing to trade-off durability, NBStack can further aggressively improve performance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461648.3463843;;;Systems AND Control
A method for the automated generating of the code-coverage ensuring input test data based on the control flow analysis;;;['Richard Lipka'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;This paper describes the design and implementation of a method aimed at the automation of the input test data. The method is based on the analysis of the control flow graph of the tested application and should provide an automated way for obtaining input test data that will allow us to systematically cover the program with unit tests. The analysis starts with the tested method parameters and searches the method body to find the relation between the inputs and the conditions that affect the control flow. The control flow graphs are obtained from the Java bytecode, however, the rest of the analysis is performed only on the control flow graph and thus should be platform-independent. The functionality of the method is verified on the set of Java applications.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3442002;;;Systems AND Control
Toward a Lingua Franca for Deterministic Concurrent Systems;;;['Marten Lohstroh', 'Christian Menard', 'Soroush Bateni', 'Edward A. Lee'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Many programming languages and programming frameworks focus on parallel and distributed computing. Several frameworks are based on actors, which provide a more disciplined model for concurrency than threads. The interactions between actors, however, if not constrained, admit nondeterminism. As a consequence, actor programs may exhibit unintended behaviors and are less amenable to rigorous testing. We show that nondeterminism can be handled in a number of ways, surveying dataflow dialects, process networks, synchronous-reactive models, and discrete-event models. These existing approaches, however, tend to require centralized control, pose challenges to modular system design, or introduce a single point of failure. We describe “reactors,” a new coordination model that combines ideas from several of these approaches to enable determinism while preserving much of the style of actors. Reactors promote modularity and allow for distributed execution. By using a logical model of time that can be associated with physical time, reactors also provide control over timing. Reactors also expose parallelism that can be exploited on multicore machines and in distributed configurations without compromising determinacy.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448128;;;Systems AND Control
A Catalog of Performance Measures for Self-Adaptive Systems;;;['Maike Bezerra da Silva', 'Carla Bezerra', 'Emanuel Coutinho', 'Paulo Henrique Maia'];;;November 2021;;;SBQS '21: Proceedings of the XX Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality;;;[Context] Self-adaptive systems (SAS) can evaluate their own behavior at runtime and change it when necessary to avoid failures. Many of those systems require a high processing power to carry out their dynamic and complex operations successfully. In this realm, performance arises as an important quality characteristic that has been widely used in the literature to drive the necessary adaptation strategies in SAS to achieve or maintain the QoS requirements. However, few studies evaluate the SAS performance efficiently due to the lack of knowledge on all possible performance measures. Still, there is a variety of measures scattered throughout the body of work in this area. [Objective] Our objective is to create a catalog of performance measures for assessing self-adaptive systems. [Method] To do that, we identified and analyzed the performance measures used in 32 primary studies found through a systematic literature mapping. [Results] As a result, 18 measures have been inserted in the catalog, having most of them addressed the sub-characteristics of time behavior and resource utilization. To validate the catalog, we implemented a subset of measures in a healthcare SAS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3493244.3493259;;;Systems AND Control
SWARM: Adaptive Load Balancing in Distributed Streaming Systems for Big Spatial Data;;;['Anas Daghistani', 'Walid G. Aref', 'Arif Ghafoor', 'Ahmed R. Mahmood'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems;;;The proliferation of GPS-enabled devices has led to the development of numerous location-based services. These services need to process massive amounts of streamed spatial data in real-time. The current scale of spatial data cannot be handled using centralized systems. This has led to the development of distributed spatial streaming systems. Existing systems are using static spatial partitioning to distribute the workload. In contrast, the real-time streamed spatial data follows non-uniform spatial distributions that are continuously changing over time. Distributed spatial streaming systems need to react to the changes in the distribution of spatial data and queries. This article introduces SWARM, a lightweight adaptivity protocol that continuously monitors the data and query workloads across the distributed processes of the spatial data streaming system and redistributes and rebalances the workloads as soon as performance bottlenecks get detected. SWARM is able to handle multiple query-execution and data-persistence models. A distributed streaming system can directly use SWARM to adaptively rebalance the system’s workload among its machines with minimal changes to the original code of the underlying spatial application. Extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic datasets illustrate that, on average, SWARM achieves 2\(\) improvement in throughput over a static grid partitioning that is determined based on observing a limited history of the data and query workloads. Moreover, SWARM reduces execution latency on average 4\(\) compared with the other technique.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460013;;;Systems AND Control
Real-time Attack-recovery for Cyber-physical Systems Using Linear-quadratic Regulator;;;['Lin Zhang', 'Pengyuan Lu', 'Fanxin Kong', 'Xin Chen', 'Oleg Sokolsky', 'Insup Lee'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;The increasing autonomy and connectivity in cyber-physical systems (CPS) come with new security vulnerabilities that are easily exploitable by malicious attackers to spoof a system to perform dangerous actions. While the vast majority of existing works focus on attack prevention and detection, the key question is “what to do after detecting an attack?”. This problem attracts fairly rare attention though its significance is emphasized by the need to mitigate or even eliminate attack impacts on a system. In this article, we study this attack response problem and propose novel real-time recovery for securing CPS. First, this work’s core component is a recovery control calculator using a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with timing and safety constraints. This component can smoothly steer back a physical system under control to a target state set before a safe deadline and maintain the system state in the set once it is driven to it. We further propose an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm that can fast solve the LQR-based recovery problem. Second, supporting components for the attack recovery computation include a checkpointer, a state reconstructor, and a deadline estimator. To realize these components respectively, we propose (i) a sliding-window-based checkpointing protocol that governs sufficient trustworthy data, (ii) a state reconstruction approach that uses the checkpointed data to estimate the current system state, and (iii) a reachability-based approach to conservatively estimate a safe deadline. Finally, we implement our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in dealing with totally 15 experimental scenarios which are designed based on 5 CPS simulators and 3 types of sensor attacks.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477010;;;Systems AND Control
Real-time detectors for digital and physical adversarial inputs to perception systems;;;['Yiannis Kantaros', 'Taylor Carpenter', 'Kaustubh Sridhar', 'Yahan Yang', 'Insup Lee', 'James Weimer'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Deep neural network (DNN) models have proven to be vulnerable to adversarial digital and physical attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack- and dataset-agnostic and real-time detector for both types of adversarial inputs to DNN-based perception systems. In particular, the proposed detector relies on the observation that adversarial images are sensitive to certain label-invariant transformations. Specifically, to determine if an image has been adversarially manipulated, the proposed detector checks if the output of the target classifier on a given input image changes significantly after feeding it a transformed version of the image under investigation. Moreover, we show that the proposed detector is computationally-light both at runtime and design-time which makes it suitable for real-time applications that may also involve large-scale image domains. To highlight this, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed detector on ImageNet, a task that is computationally challenging for the majority of relevant defenses, and on physically attacked traffic signs that may be encountered in real-time autonomy applications. Finally, we propose the first adversarial dataset, called AdvNet that includes both clean and physical traffic sign images. Our extensive comparative experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and AdvNet datasets show that VisionGuard outperforms existing defenses in terms of scalability and detection performance. We have also evaluated the proposed detector on field test data obtained on a moving vehicle equipped with a perception-based DNN being under attack.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3450535;;;Systems AND Control

Data Work in Education: Enacting and Negotiating Care and Control in Teachers' Use of Data-Driven Classroom Surveillance Technology;;;['Alex Jiahong Lu', 'Tawanna R. Dillahunt', 'Gabriela Marcu', 'Mark S.

Drawing insights from interviews with 20 K--8 teachers, in this paper we unpack how teachers enacted both care and control through their data work in collecting, interpreting, and using student behavior data. In this process, teachers found themselves subject to surveilling gazes from parents, school administrators, and students. As a result, teachers had to manipulate the student behavior data to navigate the balance between presenting a professional image to surveillants and enacting care/control that they deemed appropriate. In this paper we locate two nuanced forms of teachers' data work that have been under-studied in CSCW: (1) data work as recontextualizing meanings and (2) data work as resisting surveillance. We discuss teachers' struggle over (in)visibility and their negotiation of autonomy and subjectivity in these two forms of data work. We highlight the importance of foregrounding and making space for informal data workers' (in our case, teachers') resistance and negotiation of autonomy in light of datafication.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479596;;;Systems AND Control

OPM: An Ontology-Based Package Manager for Building Operating Systems;;;['Jakob Hviid', 'Aslak Johansen', 'Fisayo Caleb Sangogboye', 'Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard'];;;November 2021;;;IoT '21: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on the Internet of Things;;;The energy sector is experiencing new challenges with the move to green energy. One of these challenges is keeping a stable energy grid when transitioning the production to unpredictable energy generation from green sources. Demand Response (DR) can mitigate some of the lack of predictability by influencing the consumer’s load profile. Unfortunately, the cost of implementing DR, and the required infrastructure, vastly overshadows the benefits for the consumer, thereby negating the incentive to invest. Therefore, reducing the initial cost of investment is a critical factor for the success of DR. Building Operating Systems (BOS) is one possible avenue to achieve DR functionality in buildings. This paper seeks to reduce initial investment costs of BOSes, by introducing an ontology-based package manager (OPM), that dynamically resolves dependencies and installs services. An ontology-based approach to dependency resolution allows for loosely defined dependencies but also takes the context of the service into account, as well as requirements in terms of sensor availability and physical layout of the building. The OPM is evaluated by deploying a BOS and accompanying services for occupancy prediction. By significantly reducing deployment complexity, results show considerable time savings, and thereby cost reductions, on deployment and maintenance activities.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494322.3494338;;;Systems AND Control

Proactive autoscaling for edge computing systems with kubernetes;;;['Li Ju', 'Prashant Singh', 'Salman Toor'];;;December 2021;;;UCC '21: Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion;;;With the emergence of the Internet of Things and 5G technologies, the edge computing paradigm is playing increasingly important roles with better availability, latency-control and performance.

Towards priority-awareness in autonomous intelligent systems;;;['Huma Samin', 'Luis H. Garcia Paucar', 'Nelly Bencomo', 'Peter Sawyer'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;In Autonomous and Intelligent systems (AIS), the decision-making process can be divided into two parts: (i) the priorities of the requirements are determined at design-time; (ii) design selection follows where alternatives are compared, and the preferred alternatives are chosen autonomously by the AIS. Runtime design selection is a trade-off analysis between non-functional requirements (NFRs) that uses optimisation methods, including decision-analysis and utility theory. The aim is to select the design option yielding the highest expected utility. A problem with these techniques is that they use a uni-scalar cumulative utility value to represent a combined priority for all the NFRs. However, this uni-scalar value doesn't give information about the varying impacts of actions under uncertain environmental contexts on the satisfaction priorities of individual NFRs. In this paper, we present a novel use of Multi-Reward Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MR-POMDP) to support reasoning of separate NFR priorities. We discuss the use of rewards in MR-POMDPs as a way to support AIS with (a) priority-aware decision-making; and (b) maintain service-level agreement, by autonomously tuning NFRs' priorities to new contexts and based on data gathered at runtime. We evaluate our approach by applying it to a substantial Network case.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3442007;;;Systems AND Control

Integrating Machine Learning Data with Symbolic Knowledge from Collaboration Practices of Curators to Improve Conversational Systems;;;['Claudio Santos Pinhanez', 'Heloisa Candello', 'Paulo Cavalin', 'Mauro Carlos Pichiliani', 'Ana Paula Appel', 'Victor Henrique Alves Ribeiro', 'Julio Nogima', 'Maira de Bayser', 'Melina Guerra', 'Henrique Ferreira', 'Gabriel Malfatti'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;This paper describes how machine learning training data and symbolic knowledge from curators of conversational systems can be used together to improve the accuracy of those systems and to enable better curatorial tools. This is done in the context of a real-world practice of curators of conversational systems who often embed taxonomically-structured meta-knowledge into their documentation. The paper provides evidence that the practice is quite common among curators, that is used as part of their collaborative practices, and that the embedded knowledge can be mined by algorithms. Further, this meta-knowledge can be integrated, using neuro-symbolic algorithms, to the machine learning-based conversational system, to improve its run-time accuracy and to enable tools to support curatorial tasks. Those results point towards new ways of designing development tools which explore an integrated use of code and documentation by machines.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445368;;;Systems AND Control
Security Threat Analyses and Attack Models for Approximate Computing Systems: From Hardware and Micro-architecture Perspectives;;;['Pruthvy Yellu', 'Landon Buell', 'Miguel Mark', 'Michel A. Kinsy', 'Dongpeng Xu', 'Qiaoyan Yu'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems;;;Approximate computing (AC) represents a paradigm shift from conventional precise processing to inexact computation but still satisfying the system requirement on accuracy. The rapid progress on the development of diverse AC techniques allows us to apply approximate computing to many computation-intensive applications. However, the utilization of AC techniques could bring in new unique security threats to computing systems. This work does a survey on existing circuit-, architecture-, and compiler-level approximate mechanisms/algorithms, with special emphasis on potential security vulnerabilities. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed to assess the impact of the new security threats on AC systems. Moreover, this work proposes four unique visionary attack models, which systematically cover the attacks that build covert channels, compensate approximation errors, terminate normal error resilience mechanisms, and propagate additional errors. To thwart those attacks, this work further offers the guideline of countermeasure designs. Several case studies are provided to illustrate the implementation of the suggested countermeasures.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442380;;;Systems AND Control
Design of Model Predictive Controller for a Biological Fermenter;;;['Chandra Mouli Madhuranthakam', 'Omar Khan'];;;June 2021;;;ICCMS '21: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computer Modeling and Simulation;;;Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control strategy which utilizes a process model to compute a sequence of control moves with a desired control objective of tracking the desired level of the controlled variable. Extensive work has been undertaken to determine tuning strategies for model predictive controllers. However, much of that work has focused on determining the optimal tuning parameters for a particular set of process conditions, or has ignored the presence of uncertainty in the process model. This work aims to develop robust model predictive controllers by explicitly accounting for plant-model mismatch. To do this, model predictive controllers are created for three second-order process models obtained from finding the best-fit transfer function to open-loop step-response data obtained from a microbial fermenter. Further, the optimal MPC settings (namely the control horizon, prediction horizon, and the weights) are determined for the nominal case when there is no uncertainty. The optimal settings for the nominal scenario are used to inform the optimal settings for the uncertain scenario, which are found by randomly generating 500 mismatched process models based on observed experimental uncertainty. Graphical techniques are used to find the optimal settings that maximize the control performance and minimize variation in the control performance in response to step changes in the set-point and the disturbance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474963.3474987;;;Systems AND Control
Methodological principles of innovative development of economic systems;;;['I. N. Geraskina', 'A. N.

Poster: Towards Explaining the Effects of Contextual Influences on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Sanjiv S. Jha', 'Simon Mayer', 'Kimberly García'];;;November 2021;;;IoT '21: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on the Internet of Things;;;The increasing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increases the difficulty for users to understand their behavior. Using existing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, CPS can explain their behavior to the users. However, the input-output correlations used in XAI methods are not capable of explaining certain anomalies on CPS behavior caused by contextual influences (CIs) since they do not consider the context of the CPS. Some well-known techniques used for understanding such CIs on CPS are test chambers and the analysis of logged CPS data. However, test chambers are typically only available to the manufacturer of a CPS, thus not useful for understanding CIs on the shop floors. Data analysis methods focus on data correlations, which are insufficient to explain causal relationships without using expert (human) knowledge. Hence, we propose a context-aware log-based explanation system to explain the causal relationship between CIs and the behavior of a CPS. The proposed solution employs semantic technologies to access the context of the CPS. It demonstrates the causal relationship between the CPS and CIs through counterfactual explanation and abductive reasoning methods. The contextual explanations offered by the proposed system will assist users in visualizing diverse scenarios in order to improve the CPS’ behavior accordingly.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494322.3494359;;;Systems AND Control
Risk-Oriented Design Approach For Forensic-Ready Software Systems;;;['Lukas Daubner', 'Raimundas Matulevičius'];;;August 2021;;;ARES '21: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security;;;Digital forensic investigation is a complex and time-consuming activity in response to a cybersecurity incident or cybercrime to answer questions related to it. These typically are what happened, when, where, how, and who is responsible. However, answering them is often very laborious and sometimes outright impossible due to a lack of useable data. The forensic-ready software systems are designed to produce valuable on-point data for use in the investigation with potentially high evidence value. Still, the particular ways to develop these systems are currently not explored.  This paper proposes consideration of forensic readiness within security risk management to refine specific requirements on forensic-ready software systems. The idea is to re-evaluate the taken security risk decisions with the aim to provide trustable data when the security measures fail. Additionally, it also considers possible disputes, which the digital evidence can solve. Our proposed approach, risk-oriented forensic-ready design, composes of two parts: (1) process guiding the identification of the requirements in the form of potential evidence sources, and (2) supporting BPMN notation capturing the potential evidence sources and their relationship. Together they are aimed to provide a high-level overview of the forensic-ready requirements within the system. Finally, the approach is demonstrated on an automated valet parking scenario, followed by a discussion regarding its impact and usefulness within the forensic readiness effort.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465481.3470052;;;Systems AND Control

This qualitative study looks at a context where students make decisions for a self-directed learning project and analyzes their dispositional, contextual, and situational experiences from the theoretical perspectives of achievement goal theory and identity status theory. We interviewed 7 students at the conclusion of their projects in a semi-structured format with interview questions based on the theoretical aspects of achievement goal theory and identity status theory. Our analysis of the student responses then identifies their needs during the decision-making process and discusses the implications for effective recommender system metrics.

Debiased Off-Policy Evaluation for Recommendation Systems;;;['Yusuke Narita', 'Shota Yasui', 'Kohei Yata'];;;September 2021;;;RecSys '21: Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems;;;Efficient methods to evaluate new algorithms are critical for improving interactive bandit and reinforcement learning systems such as recommendation systems. A/B tests are reliable, but are time- and money-consuming, and entail a risk of failure. In this paper, we develop an alternative method, which predicts the performance of algorithms given historical data that may have been generated by a different algorithm. Our estimator has the property that its prediction converges in probability to the true performance of a counterfactual algorithm at a rate of , as the sample size N increases. We also show a correct way to estimate the variance of our prediction, thus allowing the analyst to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction. These properties hold even when the analyst does not know which among a large number of potentially important state variables are actually important. We validate our method by a simulation experiment about reinforcement learning. We finally apply it to improve advertisement design by a major advertisement company. We find that our method produces smaller mean squared errors than state-of-the-art methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460231.3474231;;;Systems AND Control
Knowledge-Guided Disentangled Representation Learning for Recommender Systems;;;['Shanlei Mu', 'Yaliang Li', 'Wayne Xin Zhao', 'Siqing Li', 'Ji-Rong Wen'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Information Systems;;;In recommender systems, it is essential to understand the underlying factors that affect user-item interaction. Recently, several studies have utilized disentangled representation learning to discover such hidden factors from user-item interaction data, which shows promising results. However, without any external guidance signal, the learned disentangled representations lack clear meanings, and are easy to suffer from the data sparsity issue. In light of these challenges, we study how to leverage knowledge graph (KG) to guide the disentangled representation learning in recommender systems. The purpose for incorporating KG is twofold, making the disentangled representations interpretable and resolving data sparsity issue. However, it is not straightforward to incorporate KG for improving disentangled representations, because KG has very different data characteristics compared with user-item interactions. We propose a novel Knowledge-guided Disentangled Representations approach (KDR) to utilizing KG to guide the disentangled representation learning in recommender systems. The basic idea, is to first learn more interpretable disentangled dimensions (explicit disentangled representations) based on structural KG, and then align implicit disentangled representations learned from user-item interaction with the explicit disentangled representations. We design a novel alignment strategy based on mutual information maximization. It enables the KG information to guide the implicit disentangled representation learning, and such learned disentangled representations will correspond to semantic information derived from KG. Finally, the fused disentangled representations are optimized to improve the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both performance and interpretability.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3464304;;;Systems AND Control
Robust Detection of Machine-induced Audio Attacks in Intelligent Audio Systems with Microphone Array;;;['Zhuohang Li', 'Cong Shi', 'Tianfang Zhang', 'Yi Xie', 'Jian Liu', 'Bo Yuan', 'Yingying Chen'];;;November 2021;;;CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;With the popularity of intelligent audio systems in recent years, their vulnerabilities have become an increasing public concern. Existing studies have designed a set of machine-induced audio attacks, such as replay attacks, synthesis attacks, hidden voice commands, inaudible attacks, and audio adversarial examples, which could expose users to serious security and privacy threats. To defend against these attacks, existing efforts have been treating them individually. While they have yielded reasonably good performance in certain cases, they can hardly be combined into an all-in-one solution to be deployed on the audio systems in practice. Additionally, modern intelligent audio devices, such as Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod, usually come equipped with microphone arrays for far-field voice recognition and noise reduction. Existing defense strategies have been focusing on single- and dual-channel audio, while only few studies have explored using multi-channel microphone array for defending specific types of audio attack. Motivated by the lack of systematic research on defending miscellaneous audio attacks and the potential benefits of multi-channel audio, this paper builds a holistic solution for detecting machine-induced audio attacks leveraging multi-channel microphone arrays on modern intelligent audio systems. Specifically, we utilize magnitude and phase spectrograms of multi-channel audio to extract spatial information and leverage a deep learning model to detect the fundamental difference between human speech and adversarial audio generated by the playback machines. Moreover, we adopt an unsupervised domain adaptation training framework to further improve the model's generalizability in new acoustic environments. Evaluation is conducted under various settings on a public multi-channel replay attack dataset and a self-collected multi-channel audio attack dataset involving 5 types of advanced audio attacks. The results show that our method can achieve an equal error rate (EER) as low as 6.6% in detecting a variety of machine-induced attacks. Even in new acoustic environments, our method can still achieve an EER as low as 8.8%.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484755;;;Systems AND Control
Fault-tolerant deep neural networks for processing-in-memory based autonomous edge systems;;;['Siyue Wang', 'Geng Yuan', 'Xiaolong Ma', 'Yanyu Li', 'Xue Lin', 'Bhavya Kailkhura'];;;March 2022;;;DATE '22: Proceedings of the 2022 Conference &amp; Exhibition on Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe;;;In-memory deep neural network (DNN) accelerators will be the key for energy-efficient autonomous edge systems. The resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is a potential solution for the non-CMOS-based in-memory computing platform for energy-efficient autonomous edge systems, thanks to its promising characteristics, such as near-zero leakage-power and non-volatility. However, due to the hardware instability of ReRAM, the weights of the DNN model may deviate from the originally trained weights, resulting in accuracy loss. To mitigate this undesirable accuracy loss, we propose two stochastic fault-tolerant training methods to generally improve the models' robustness without dealing with individual devices. Moreover, we propose Stability Score---a comprehensive metric that serves as an indicator to the instability problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the DNN models trained using our proposed stochastic fault-tolerant training method achieve superior performance, which provides better flexibility, scalability, and deployability of ReRAM on the autonomous edge systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3539845.3539946;;;Systems AND Control
QN-based Modeling and Analysis of Software Performance Antipatterns for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Riccardo Pinciroli', 'Connie U. Smith', 'Catia Trubiani'];;;April 2021;;;ICPE '21: Proceedings of the ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering;;;Identifying performance problems in modern software systems is nontrivial, even more so when looking at specific application domains, such as cyber-physical systems. The heterogeneity of software and hardware components makes the process of performance evaluation more challenging, and traditional software performance engineering techniques may fail while dealing with interacting and heterogeneous components. The goal of this paper is to introduce a model-based approach to understand software performance problems in cyber-physical systems. In our previous work, we listed some common bad practices, namely software performance antipatterns, that may occur. Here we are interested in shedding light on these antipatterns by means of performance models, i.e., queuing network models, that provide evidence of how antipatterns may affect the overall system performance. Starting from the specification of three software performance antipatterns tailored for cyber-physical systems, we provide the queuing network models capturing the corresponding bad practices. The analysis of these models demonstrates their usefulness in recognizing performance problems early in the software development process. This way, performance engineers are supported in the task of detecting and fixing the performance criticalities.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3427921.3450251;;;Systems AND Control
Towards Unbiased and Robust Causal Ranking for Recommender Systems;;;['Teng Xiao', 'Suhang Wang'];;;February 2022;;;WSDM '22: Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining;;;We study the problem of optimizing ranking metrics with unbiased and robust causal estimation for recommender systems. A user may click/purchase an item regardless of whether the item is recommended or not. Thus, it is important to estimate the causal effect of recommendation and rank items higher with a larger causal effect. However, most existing works focused on improving the accuracy of recommendations, which usually have large bias and variance. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a general and theoretically rigorous framework for causal recommender systems, which enables unbiased evaluation and learning for the ranking metrics with confounding bias. We first propose a robust estimator for unbiased ranking evaluation and theoretically show that this estimator has a smaller bias and variance. We then propose a deep variational information bottleneck (IB) approach to exploit the sufficiency of the propensity score for estimation adjustment and better generalization. We also provide the learning bound and develop an unbiased learning algorithm to optimize the causal metric. Results on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our evaluation and learning algorithms significantly outperform existing methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488560.3498521;;;Systems AND Control
AMP: adversarial motion priors for stylized physics-based character control;;;['Xue Bin Peng', 'Ze Ma', 'Pieter Abbeel', 'Sergey Levine', 'Angjoo Kanazawa'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Graphics;;;Synthesizing graceful and life-like behaviors for physically simulated characters has been a fundamental challenge in computer animation. Data-driven methods that leverage motion tracking are a prominent class of techniques for producing high fidelity motions for a wide range of behaviors. However, the effectiveness of these tracking-based methods often hinges on carefully designed objective functions, and when applied to large and diverse motion datasets, these methods require significant additional machinery to select the appropriate motion for the character to track in a given scenario. In this work, we propose to obviate the need to manually design imitation objectives and mechanisms for motion selection by utilizing a fully automated approach based on adversarial imitation learning. High-level task objectives that the character should perform can be specified by relatively simple reward functions, while the low-level style of the character's behaviors can be specified by a dataset of unstructured motion clips, without any explicit clip selection or sequencing. For example, a character traversing an obstacle course might utilize a task-reward that only considers forward progress, while the dataset contains clips of relevant behaviors such as running, jumping, and rolling. These motion clips are used to train an adversarial motion prior, which specifies style-rewards for training the character through reinforcement learning (RL). The adversarial RL procedure automatically selects which motion to perform, dynamically interpolating and generalizing from the dataset. Our system produces high-quality motions that are comparable to those achieved by state-of-the-art tracking-based techniques, while also being able to easily accommodate large datasets of unstructured motion clips. Composition of disparate skills emerges automatically from the motion prior, without requiring a high-level motion planner or other task-specific annotations of the motion clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a diverse cast of complex simulated characters and a challenging suite of motor control tasks.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450626.3459670;;;Systems AND Control

In response, researchers and educators have looked to integrate ethics into Computer Science curricula, either by creating ethics-exclusive courses or embedding ethics into existing computing topics. Regardless of approach, few ethics integrations seek to explicitly center counternarratives, narratives opposing dominant narratives within computing, as a method of instruction. Given an existing teaching opportunity, our prior experience with computer systems education, and a lack of existing ethics integrations into computer systems, we integrated counternarratives into an introductory systems course. We framed this integration through theHouse of Computing (HoC), a structural metaphor that frames the computing discipline as an object for critique. Throughout the course, we presented counternarratives alongside technical content. We assessed student understanding of counternarratives through "floorplans'': metaphorical representations of course units, or floors within theHoC. Through an analysis of students' first floorplan, we found that nearly every student expressed existing or newfound awareness of structural problems within computing, though the novelty of the floorplans concept challenged students. Based on this experience, we offer recommendations for instructors looking to teach computer systems critically or integrate counternarratives into other computing courses.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478431.3499394;;;Systems AND Control

We then propose three learning techniques for enhancing decision-making in multi-round setups. We illustrate the benefits of our decision-making model through multiple interdependent real-world systems and quantify the level of gain compared to the case in which the defenders are behavioral. We also show the benefit of our learning techniques against different attack models. We identify the effects of different system parameters (e.g., the defenders' security budget availability and distribution, the degree of interdependency among defenders, and collaborative defense strategies) on the degree of suboptimality of security outcomes due to behavioral decision-making.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3433210.3437534;;;Systems AND Control
Systematic testing of autonomous driving systems using map topology-based scenario classification;;;['Yun Tang', 'Yuan Zhou', 'Tianwei Zhang', 'Fenghua Wu', 'Yang Liu', 'Gang Wang'];;;November 2021;;;ASE '21: Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering;;;Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs), which replace humans to drive vehicles, are complex software systems deployed in autonomous vehicles (AVs). Since the execution of ADSs highly relies on maps, it is essential to perform global map-based testing for ADSs to guarantee their correctness and AVs' safety in different situations. Existing methods focus more on specific scenarios rather than global testing throughout the map. Testing on a global map is challenging since the complex lane connections in a map can generate enormous scenarios. In this work, we propose Atlas, an approach to ADSs' collision avoidance testing using map topology-based scenario classification. The core insight of Atlas is to generate diverse testing scenarios by classifying junction lanes according to their topology-based interaction patterns. First, Atlas divides the junction lanes into different classes such that an ADS can execute similar collision avoidance maneuvers on the lanes in the same class. Second, for each class, Atlas selects one junction lane to construct the testing scenario and generate test cases using a genetic algorithm. Finally, we implement and evaluate Atlas on Baidu Apollo with the LGSVL simulator on the San Francisco map. Results show that Atlas exposes nine types of real issues in Apollo 6.0 and reduces the number of junction lanes for testing by 98%.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678735;;;Systems AND Control
Enhancing the Quantum Linear Systems Algorithm Using Richardson Extrapolation;;;['Almudena Carrera Vazquez', 'Ralf Hiptmair', 'Stefan Woerner'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing;;;We present a quantum algorithm to solve systems of linear equations of the form Ax=b, where A is a tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix and b results from discretizing an analytic function, with a circuit complexity of O(1/√ε, poly (log κ, log N)), where N denotes the number of equations, ε is the accuracy, and κ the condition number. The repeat-until-success algorithm has to be run O(κ/(1-ε)) times to succeed, leveraging amplitude amplification, and needs to be sampled O(1/ε2) times. Thus, the algorithm achieves an exponential improvement with respect to N over classical methods. In particular, we present efficient oracles for state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and a set of observables together with the corresponding error and complexity analyses. As the main result of this work, we show how to use Richardson extrapolation to enhance Hamiltonian simulation, resulting in an implementation of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) within the algorithm with 1/√ε circuits that can be run in parallel each with circuit complexity 1/√ ε  instead of 1/ε. Furthermore, we analyze necessary conditions for the overall algorithm to achieve an exponential speedup compared to classical methods. Our approach is not limited to the considered setting and can be applied to more general problems where Hamiltonian simulation is approximated via product formulae, although our theoretical results would need to be extended accordingly. All the procedures presented are implemented with Qiskit and tested for small systems using classical simulation as well as using real quantum devices available through the IBM Quantum Experience.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3490631;;;Systems AND Control

To facilitate more efficient business processes and remote control, such devices are being connected to IP networks. Due to the difficulty in predicting network packets and the interrelated workloads of interrupt handlers and drivers, devices controlling time critical processes stand under the risk of missing process deadlines when under high network loads. Additionally, devices at the edge of large networks and the internet are subject to a high risk of load spikes and network packet overloads. In this paper, we investigate strategies to detect network packet overloads in real-time and present four approaches to adaptively mitigate local deadline misses. In addition to two strategies mitigating network bursts with and without hysteresis, we present and discuss two novel mitigation algorithms, called Budget and Queue Mitigation.

Path-dependent controller and estimator synthesis with robustness to delayed and missing data;;;['Syed M. Hassaan', 'Qiang Shen', 'Sze Zheng Yong'];;;May 2021;;;HSCC '21: Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control;;;This paper presents path-dependent feedback controllers and estimators with bounded tracking and estimation error guarantees for discrete-time affine systems with time-varying delayed and missing data, where the set of all temporal patterns for the missing or delayed data is constrained by a fixed-length language. In particular, we propose two controller/estimator synthesis approaches based on output feedback and output error feedback parameterizations such that the tracking or estimation errors satisfy a property known as equalized recovery, where the errors are guaranteed to satisfy a recovery level at the start and the end of a finite time horizon, but may temporarily increase (by a bounded amount) within the horizon. To achieve this, we introduce a mapping of the fixed-length delayed/missing data language onto a reduced event-based language, and present designs with feedback gain matrices that adapt based on the observed path in the reduced language, resulting in improved performance. Furthermore, we propose a word observer that finds the set of words (i.e., the delayed/missing data patterns) in the original fixed-length language that are compatible with the observed path. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches when compared to existing approaches is demonstrated using several illustrative examples.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447928.3456655;;;Systems AND Control
Metamorphic testing on multi-module UAV systems;;;['Rui Li', 'Huai Liu', 'Guannan Lou', 'Xi Zheng', 'Xiao Liu', 'Tsong Yueh Chen'];;;November 2021;;;ASE '21: Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering;;;Recent years have seen a rapid development of machine learning based multi-module unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. To address the oracle problem in autonomous systems, numerous studies have been conducted to use meta-morphic testing to automatically generate test scenes for various modules, e.g., those in self-driving cars. However, as most of the studies are based on unit testing including end-to-end model-based testing, a similar testing approach may not be equally effective for UAV systems where multiple modules are working closely together. Therefore, in this paper, instead of unit testing, we propose a novel metamorphic system testing framework for UAV, named MSTU, to detect the defects in multi-module UAV systems. A preliminary evaluation plan to apply MSTU on an emerging autonomous multi-module UAV system is also presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed testing framework.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678841;;;Systems AND Control
Heterogeneity-aware Multicore Synchronization for Intermittent Systems;;;['Wei-Ming Chen', 'Tei-Wei Kuo', 'Pi-Cheng Hsiu'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Intermittent systems enable batteryless devices to operate through energy harvesting by leveraging the complementary characteristics of volatile (VM) and non-volatile memory (NVM). Unfortunately, alternate and frequent accesses to heterogeneous memories for accumulative execution across power cycles can significantly hinder computation progress. The progress impediment is mainly due to more CPU time being wasted for slow NVM accesses than for fast VM accesses. This paper explores how to leverage heterogeneous cores to mitigate the progress impediment caused by heterogeneous memories. In particular, a delegable and adaptive synchronization protocol is proposed to allow memory accesses to be delegated between cores and to dynamically adapt to diverse memory access latency. Moreover, our design guarantees task serializability across multiple cores and maintains data consistency despite frequent power failures. We integrated our design into FreeRTOS running on a Cypress device featuring heterogeneous dual cores and hybrid memories. Experimental results show that, compared to recent approaches that assume single-core intermittent systems, our design can improve computation progress at least 1.8x and even up to 33.9x by leveraging core heterogeneity.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3476992;;;Systems AND Control
PipAttack: Poisoning Federated Recommender Systems for Manipulating Item Promotion;;;['Shijie Zhang', 'Hongzhi Yin', 'Tong Chen', 'Zi Huang', 'Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen', 'Lizhen Cui'];;;February 2022;;;WSDM '22: Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining;;;Due to the growing privacy concerns, decentralization emerges rapidly in personalized services, especially recommendation. Also, recent studies have shown that centralized models are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, compromising their integrity. In the context of recommender systems, a typical goal of such poisoning attacks is to promote the adversary's target items by interfering with the training dataset and/or process. Hence, a common practice is to subsume recommender systems under the decentralized federated learning paradigm, which enables all user devices to collaboratively learn a global recommender while retaining all the sensitive data locally. Without exposing the full knowledge of the recommender and entire dataset to end-users, such federated recommendation is widely regarded 'safe' towards poisoning attacks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to backdooring federated recommender systems for targeted item promotion. The core tactic is to take advantage of the inherent popularity bias that commonly exists in data-driven recommenders. As popular items are more likely to appear in the recommendation list, our innovatively designed attack model enables the target item to have the characteristics of popular items in the embedding space. Then, by uploading carefully crafted gradients via a small number of malicious users during the model update, we can effectively increase the exposure rate of a target (unpopular) item in the resulted federated recommender. Evaluations on two real-world datasets show that 1) our attack model significantly boosts the exposure rate of the target item in a stealthy way, without harming the accuracy of the poisoned recommender; and 2) existing defenses are not effective enough, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local model poisoning attacks to federated recommender systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488560.3498386;;;Systems AND Control
Achieving Sybil-Proofness in Distributed Work Systems;;;['Alexander Stannat', 'Can Umut Ileri', 'Dion Gijswijt', 'Johan Pouwelse'];;;May 2021;;;AAMAS '21: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems;;;In a multi-agent system where agents provide quantifiable work for each other on a voluntary basis, reputation mechanisms are incorporated to induce cooperation. Hereby agents assign their peers numerical scores based on their reported transaction histories. In such systems, adversaries can launch an attack by creating fake identities called Sybils, who report counterfeit transactions among one another, with the aim of increasing their own scores in the eyes of others. This paper provides new results about the Sybil-proofness of reputation mechanisms. We revisit the impossibility result of Seuken and Parkes (2011), who show that strongly-beneficial Sybil attacks cannot be prevented on reputation mechanisms satisfying three particular requirements. We prove that, under a more rigorous set of definitions of Sybil attack benefit, this result no longer holds. We characterise properties under which reputation mechanisms are susceptible to strongly-beneficial Sybil attacks. Building on our results, we propose a minimal set of requirements for reputation mechanisms to achieve resistance to such attacks, which are stronger than the results by Cheng and Friedman (2005), who show Sybil-proofness of certain asymmetric reputation mechanisms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464098;;;Systems AND Control
Predicting Performance Anomalies in Software Systems at Run-time;;;['Guoliang Zhao', 'Safwat Hassan', 'Ying Zou', 'Derek Truong', 'Toby Corbin'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology;;;High performance is a critical factor to achieve and maintain the success of a software system. Performance anomalies represent the performance degradation issues (e.g., slowing down in system response times) of software systems at run-time. Performance anomalies can cause a dramatically negative impact on users’ satisfaction. Prior studies propose different approaches to detect anomalies by analyzing execution logs and resource utilization metrics after the anomalies have happened. However, the prior detection approaches cannot predict the anomalies ahead of time; such limitation causes an inevitable delay in taking corrective actions to prevent performance anomalies from happening. We propose an approach that can predict performance anomalies in software systems and raise anomaly warnings in advance. Our approach uses a Long-Short Term Memory neural network to capture the normal behaviors of a software system. Then, our approach predicts performance anomalies by identifying the early deviations from the captured normal system behaviors. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our approach using two real-world software systems (i.e., Elasticsearch and Hadoop). We compare the performance of our approach with two baselines. The first baseline is one state-to-the-art baseline called Unsupervised Behavior Learning. The second baseline predicts performance anomalies by checking if the resource utilization exceeds pre-defined thresholds. Our results show that our approach can predict various performance anomalies with high precision (i.e., 97–100%) and recall (i.e., 80–100%), while the baselines achieve 25–97% precision and 93–100% recall. For a range of performance anomalies, our approach can achieve sufficient lead times that vary from 20 to 1,403 s (i.e., 23.4 min). We also demonstrate the ability of our approach to predict the performance anomalies that are caused by real-world performance bugs. For predicting performance anomalies that are caused by real-world performance bugs, our approach achieves 95–100% precision and 87–100% recall, while the baselines achieve 49–83% precision and 100% recall. The obtained results show that our approach outperforms the existing anomaly prediction approaches and is able to predict performance anomalies in real-world systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3440757;;;Systems AND Control
The Linkages Between Social Protection Program and Environmental Impacts in Food Systems: A Conceptual Model;;;['Ahmad Rizal Yassaruddin', 'Armand Omar Moeis'];;;May 2021;;;APCORISE '21: Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Research in Industrial and Systems Engineering;;;∗The world is facing greater challenges in eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and all forms of malnutrition. Political conflict, economic slowdown, climate changes, and a pandemic are apparently becoming threats to progress. As one of the externalities of a food system, public policy like social protection programs, encompassed a range of regulations and programs used for problem-solving and holds a determinant role in the long term application of food systems. However, the food system is a complex web of activities that involve all fundamental aspects of social, environmental, and economic to achieve the state of the equilibrium system. The negative outcomes towards the environment are unavoidable since 26% of global emissions is coming from food production, processing, and distribution. The impact assessment of social protection policies towards the environment remains limited. This paper investigates the environmental impacts of three social protection programs: cash transfer, food subsidy, and in-kind transfer; using a system dynamics approach. The conceptual model provides a deep-structural insight and understanding of the ideas on how social protection programs in the food and agricultural system strongly influence the outturn of the environmental impacts. The developed model has shown the interlinkages of household expenditure increment, which influences by income level and social protection access that caused more dynamics and uncertain behavior in food consumption level. This considered as more impactful for environment sustainability since it will cause more production and distribution activities which drawn more greenhouse gas and food loss. Three external factors are determined as the control variables: price settings policy, import policy, and the amount of regional supply.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468013.3468336;;;Systems AND Control
Fighting Mainstream Bias in Recommender Systems via Local Fine Tuning;;;['Ziwei Zhu', 'James Caverlee'];;;February 2022;;;WSDM '22: Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining;;;In collaborative filtering, the quality of recommendations critically relies on how easily a model can find similar users for a target user. Hence, a niche user who prefers items out of the mainstream may receive poor recommendations, while a mainstream user sharing interests with many others will likely receive recommendations of higher quality. In this work, we study this mainstream bias centering around three key thrusts. First, to distinguish mainstream and niche users, we explore four approaches based on outlier detection techniques to identify a mainstream score indicating the mainstream level for each user. Second, we empirically show that severe mainstream bias is produced by conventional recommendation models. Last, we explore both global and local methods to mitigate the bias. Concretely, we propose two global models: Distribution Calibration (DC) and Weighted Loss (WL) methods; and one local method: Local Fine Tuning (LFT) method. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed methods to improve utility for niche users and also show that the proposed LFT can improve the utility for mainstream users at the same time.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488560.3498427;;;Systems AND Control
Design of Distributed Reconfigurable Robotics Systems with ReconROS;;;['Christian Lienen', 'Marco Platzner'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems;;;Robotics applications process large amounts of data in real time and require compute platforms that provide high performance and energy efficiency. FPGAs are well suited for many of these applications, but there is a reluctance in the robotics community to use hardware acceleration due to increased design complexity and a lack of consistent programming models across the software/hardware boundary. In this article, we present ReconROS, a framework that integrates the widely used robot operating system (ROS) with ReconOS, which features multithreaded programming of hardware and software threads for reconfigurable computers. This unique combination gives ROS 2 developers the flexibility to transparently accelerate parts of their robotics applications in hardware. We elaborate on the architecture and the design flow for ReconROS and report on a set of experiments that underline the feasibility and flexibility of our approach.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494571;;;Systems AND Control
Structured Graph Convolutional Networks with Stochastic Masks for Recommender Systems;;;['Huiyuan Chen', 'Lan Wang', 'Yusan Lin', 'Chin-Chia Michael Yeh', 'Fei Wang', 'Hao Yang'];;;July 2021;;;SIGIR '21: Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;;;Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful for collaborative filtering. The key component of GCNs is to explore neighborhood aggregation mechanisms to extract high-level representations of users and items. However, real-world user-item graphs are often incomplete and noisy. Aggregating misleading neighborhood information may lead to sub-optimal performance if GCNs are not regularized properly. Also, the real-world user-item graphs are often sparse and low rank. These two intrinsic graph properties are widely used in shallow matrix completion models, but far less studied in graph neural models. Here we propose Structured Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs) to enhance the performance of GCNs by exploiting graph structural properties of sparsity and low rank. To achieve sparsity, we attach each layer of a GCN with a trainable stochastic binary mask to prune noisy and insignificant edges, resulting in a clean and sparsified graph. To preserve its low-rank property, the nuclear norm regularization is applied. We jointly learn the parameters of stochastic binary masks and original GCNs by solving a stochastic binary optimization problem. An unbiased gradient estimator is further proposed to better backpropagate the gradients of binary variables. Experimental results demonstrate that SGCNs achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art GCNs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3462868;;;Systems AND Control
An anomaly detection framework for digital twin driven cyber-physical systems;;;['Chuanchao Gao', 'Heejong Park', 'Arvind Easwaran'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;In recent years, the digital twin has been one of the active research areas in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3450533;;;Systems AND Control
Towards a model-integrated runtime monitoring infrastructure for cyber-physical systems;;;['Michael Vierhauser', 'Hussein Marah', 'Antonio Garmendia', 'Jane Cleland-Huang', 'Manuel Wimmer'];;;May 2021;;;ICSE-NIER '21: Proceedings of the 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results;;;Runtime monitoring is essential for ensuring the safe operation and enabling self-adaptive behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). It requires the creation of system monitors, instrumentation for data collection, and the definition of constraints. All of these aspects need to evolve to accommodate changes in the system. However, most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors and constraints for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for evolving the monitoring infrastructure. Without this support, constraints and monitors can become stale and become less effective in long-running, rapidly changing CPS. In this "new and emerging results" paper we propose a novel framework for model-integrated runtime monitoring. We combine model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring to automatically generate large parts of the monitoring framework and to reduce the maintenance effort necessary when parts of the monitored system change. We build a prototype and evaluate our approach against a system for controlling the flights of unmanned aerial vehicles.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICSE-NIER52604.2021.00028;;;Systems AND Control
Don't Hate the Player, Hate the Game: Safety and Utility in Multi-Agent Congestion Control;;;['Pratiksha Thaker', 'Matei Zaharia', 'Tatsunori Hashimoto'];;;November 2021;;;HotNets '21: Proceedings of the 20th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks;;;We posit that unfairness between congestion control algorithms in a network often results from actors optimizing, or attempting to optimize, incompatible utility functions. In order to mitigate this, we propose that algorithm designers should explicitly declare a utility function they hope to optimize, which enables theoretical analysis of the safety of the utility function with respect to other utilities in the network. When we can place utilities in a common game-theoretic framework, we can analytically determine the potential for an application with one of those utilities to be unsafe before it is deployed in a network, rather than determining safety properties ad-hoc from measurements after deployment. We give examples of the types of restrictions and guarantees that can arise from such a model in the context of rate-based congestion control protocols.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3484266.3487392;;;Systems AND Control
Applying Machine Learning in Self-adaptive Systems: A Systematic Literature Review;;;['Omid Gheibi', 'Danny Weyns', 'Federico Quin'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems;;;Recently, we have been witnessing a rapid increase in the use of machine learning techniques in self-adaptive systems. Machine learning has been used for a variety of reasons, ranging from learning a model of the environment of a system during operation to filtering large sets of possible configurations before analyzing them. While a body of work on the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems exists, there is currently no systematic overview of this area. Such an overview is important for researchers to understand the state of the art and direct future research efforts. This article reports the results of a systematic literature review that aims at providing such an overview. We focus on self-adaptive systems that are based on a traditional Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE)-based feedback loop. The research questions are centered on the problems that motivate the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering aspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges in this area. The search resulted in 6,709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection. Analysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for updating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and managing resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems are primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with classification, regression, and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods. Surprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only applied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include the performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with more complex types of goals. From the insights derived from this systematic literature review, we outline an initial design process for applying machine learning in self-adaptive systems that are based on MAPE feedback loops.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3469440;;;Systems AND Control
Non-asymptotic and accurate learning of nonlinear dynamical systems;;;['Yahya Sattar', 'Samet Oymak'];;;None;;;The Journal of Machine Learning Research;;;We consider the problem of learning a nonlinear dynamical system governed by a nonlinear state equation ht+1 = ϕ(ht, ut; θ) +wt. Here θ is the unknown system dynamics, ht is the state, ut is the input and wt is the additive noise vector. We study gradient based algorithms to learn the system dynamics θ from samples obtained from a single finite trajectory. If the system is run by a stabilizing input policy, then using a mixing-time argument we show that temporally-dependent samples can be approximated by i.i.d. samples. We then develop new guarantees for the uniform convergence of the gradient of the empirical loss induced by these i.i.d. samples. Unlike existing works, our bounds are noise sensitive which allows for learning the ground-truth dynamics with high accuracy and small sample complexity. When combined, our results facilitate efficient learning of a broader class of nonlinear dynamical systems as compared to the prior works. We specialize our guarantees to entrywise nonlinear activations and verify our theory in various numerical experiments.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586729;;;Systems AND Control
A Survey on Stream-Based Recommender Systems;;;['Marie Al-Ghossein', 'Talel Abdessalem', 'Anthony BARRÉ'];;;None;;;ACM Computing Surveys;;;Recommender Systems (RS) have proven to be effective tools to help users overcome information overload, and significant advances have been made in the field over the past two decades. Although addressing the recommendation problem required first a formulation that could be easily studied and evaluated, there currently exists a gap between research contributions and industrial applications where RS are actually deployed. In particular, most RS are meant to function in batch: they rely on a large static dataset and build a recommendation model that is only periodically updated. This functioning introduces several limitations in various settings, leading to considering more realistic settings where RS learn from continuous streams of interactions. Such RS are framed as Stream-Based Recommender Systems (SBRS).In this article, we review SBRS, underline their relation with time-aware RS and online adaptive learning, and present and categorize existing work that tackle the corresponding problem and its multiple facets. We discuss the methodologies used to evaluate SBRS and the adapted datasets that can be used, and finally we outline open challenges in the area.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453443;;;Systems AND Control

HMDS: A Makespan Minimizing DAG Scheduler for Heterogeneous Distributed Systems;;;['Debabrata Senapati', 'Arnab Sarkar', 'Chandan Karfa'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;The problem of scheduling Directed Acyclic Graphs in order to minimize makespan (schedule length), is known to be a challenging and computationally hard problem. Therefore, researchers have endeavored towards the design of various heuristic solution generation techniques both for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous computing platforms. This work first presents HMDS-Bl, a list-based heuristic makespan minimization algorithm for task graphs on fully connected heterogeneous platforms. Subsequently, HMDS-Bl has been enhanced by empowering it with a low-overhead depth-first branch and bound based search approach, resulting in a new algorithm called HMDS. HMDS has been equipped with a set of novel tunable pruning mechanisms, which allow the designer to obtain a judicious balance between performance (makespan) and solution generation times, depending on the specific scenario at hand. Experimental analyses using randomly generated DAGs as well as benchmark task graphs, have shown that HMDS is able to comprehensively outperform state-of-the-art algorithms such as HEFT, PEFT, PPTS, etc., in terms of archived makespans while incurring bounded additional computation time overhead.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477037;;;Systems AND Control
High frequency automated market making algorithms with adverse selection risk control via reinforcement learning;;;['Muchen Zhao', 'Vadim Linetsky'];;;November 2021;;;ICAIF '21: Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on AI in Finance;;;Market makers provide liquidity by placing limit orders on both sides of the market (bids and offers) while aiming to earn the bid-offer (bid-ask) spread. Their long-term performance is significantly determined by their ability to mitigate the risk of adverse selection when their limit orders are picked off by informed traders possessing relevant information that moves the market to a new level resulting in losses to market makers. This paper proposes a high-frequency feature Book Exhaustion Rate (BER) and shows theoretically and empirically that the BER can serve as a direct measurement of the adverse selection risk from an equilibrium point of view. We train a market making algorithm via Reinforcement Learning using three years of limit order book data on Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) S&P 500 and 10-year Treasury note futures and demonstrate that with utilizing the BER allows the algorithm to avoid large losses due to adverse selection and achieve stable performance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3490354.3494398;;;Systems AND Control

However, the system complexity inevitably enlarges the attack surface and adds difficulty in guaranteeing the security and safety of MRSs. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation about the Byzantine threats in MRSs, where some robot is untrusted. We design a practical methodology to identify potential Byzantine risks in a given MRS workload built from the Robot Operating System (ROS). It consists of three novel steps (requirement specification using signal temporal logic, attack surface determination via data-flow analysis, attack identification using requirement-driven fuzzing) to thoroughly assess MRS workloads. We use this fuzzing method to inspect five typical MRS workloads from past works and the ROS platform, and identify three novel kinds of attacks that can be launched with five attack strategies. We conduct comprehensive experiments in the Gazebo simulator and a real-world MRS with three TurtlBot3 robots to validate these attacks, which can remarkably decrease the system’s performance, or even cause task failures.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3471621.3471867;;;Systems AND Control

Much ADO about failures: a fault-aware model for compositional verification of strongly consistent distributed systems;;;['Wolf Honoré', 'Jieung Kim', 'Ji-Yong Shin', 'Zhong Shao'];;;October 2021;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages;;;Despite recent advances, guaranteeing the correctness of large-scale distributed applications without compromising performance remains a challenging problem. Network and node failures are inevitable and, for some applications, careful control over how they are handled is essential. Unfortunately, existing approaches either completely hide these failures behind an atomic state machine replication (SMR) interface, or expose all of the network-level details, sacrificing atomicity. We propose a novel, compositional, atomic distributed object (ADO) model for strongly consistent distributed systems that combines the best of both options. The object-oriented API abstracts over protocol-specific details and decouples high-level correctness reasoning from implementation choices. At the same time, it intentionally exposes an abstract view of certain key distributed failure cases, thus allowing for more fine-grained control over them than SMR-like models. We demonstrate that proving properties even of composite distributed systems can be straightforward with our Coq verification framework, Advert, thanks to the ADO model. We also show that a variety of common protocols including multi-Paxos and Chain Replication refine the ADO semantics, which allows one to freely choose among them for an application's implementation without modifying ADO-level correctness proofs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485474;;;Systems AND Control
A Graph-Based Approach for Mitigating Multi-Sided Exposure Bias in Recommender Systems;;;['Masoud Mansoury', 'Himan Abdollahpouri', 'Mykola Pechenizkiy', 'Bamshad Mobasher', 'Robin Burke'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Information Systems;;;Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has been the subject of extensive recent research. A specific form of fairness is supplier exposure fairness, where the objective is to ensure equitable coverage of items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. This is especially important in multistakeholder recommendation scenarios where it may be important to optimize utilities not just for the end user but also for other stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair representation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes accomplished by attempting to increase aggregate diversity to mitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in recommendations. In this article, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based algorithm that works as a post-processing approach after recommendation generation to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm iteratively adds high-quality items that have low visibility or items from suppliers with low exposure to the users’ final recommendation lists. A comprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, although it significantly improves exposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of relevance of the recommendations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3470948;;;Systems AND Control
Request, Coalesce, Serve, and Forget: Miss-Optimized Memory Systems for Bandwidth-Bound Cache-Unfriendly Applications on FPGAs;;;['Mikhail Asiatici', 'Paolo Ienne'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems;;;Applications such as large-scale sparse linear algebra and graph analytics are challenging to accelerate on FPGAs due to the short irregular memory accesses, resulting in low cache hit rates. Nonblocking caches reduce the bandwidth required by misses by requesting each cache line only once, even when there are multiple misses corresponding to it. However, such reuse mechanism is traditionally implemented using an associative lookup. This limits the number of misses that are considered for reuse to a few tens, at most. In this article, we present an efficient pipeline that can process and store thousands of outstanding misses in cuckoo hash tables in on-chip SRAM with minimal stalls. This brings the same bandwidth advantage as a larger cache for a fraction of the area budget, because outstanding misses do not need a data array, which can significantly speed up irregular memory-bound latency-insensitive applications. In addition, we extend nonblocking caches to generate variable-length bursts to memory, which increases the bandwidth delivered by DRAMs and their controllers. The resulting miss-optimized memory system provides up to 25% speedup with 24× area reduction on 15 large sparse matrix-vector multiplication benchmarks evaluated on an embedded and a datacenter FPGA system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466823;;;Systems AND Control
Toward a Holistic Approach to Verification and Validation of Autonomous Cognitive Systems;;;['Angelo Ferrando', 'Louise A. Dennis', 'Rafael C. Cardoso', 'Michael Fisher', 'Davide Ancona', 'Viviana Mascardi'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology;;;When applying formal verification to a system that interacts with the real world, we must use a model of the environment. This model represents an abstraction of the actual environment, so it is necessarily incomplete and hence presents an issue for system verification. If the actual environment matches the model, then the verification is correct; however, if the environment falls outside the abstraction captured by the model, then we cannot guarantee that the system is well behaved. A solution to this problem consists in exploiting the model of the environment used for statically verifying the system’s behaviour and, if the verification succeeds, using it also for validating the model against the real environment via runtime verification. The article discusses this approach and demonstrates its feasibility by presenting its implementation on top of a framework integrating the Agent Java PathFinder model checker. A high-level Domain Specific Language is used to model the environment in a user-friendly way; the latter is then compiled to trace expressions for both static formal verification and runtime verification. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to two different case studies: an autonomous cruise control system and a simulation of the Mars Curiosity rover.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447246;;;Systems AND Control

The problem as to whether the property of interest holds for the system can then be expressed either as a reachability or as a termination query on the program. This allows to immediately adapt mature verification techniques developed for general-purpose languages to domain-specific languages, and to effortlessly integrate new techniques as soon as they become available. We test our approach on a selection of concurrent systems originated from different contexts from population protocols to models of flocking behaviour. By combining a comprehensive range of program verification techniques, from traditional symbolic execution to modern inductive-based methods such as property-directed reachability, we are able to draw consistent and correct verification verdicts for the considered systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3490387;;;Systems AND Control
Towards a workflow for model-based testing of embedded systems;;;['Muhammad Nouman Zafar', 'Wasif Afzal', 'Eduard Enoiu'];;;August 2021;;;A-TEST 2021: Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Automating TEST Case Design, Selection, and Evaluation;;;Model-based testing (MBT) has been previously used to validate embedded systems. However, (i) creation of a model conforming to the behavioural aspects of an embedded system, (ii) generation of executable test scripts and (iii) assessment of test verdict, re-quires a systematic process. In this paper, we have presented a three-phase tool-supported MBT workflow for the testing of an embedded system, that spans from requirements specification to test verdict assessment. The workflow starts with a simplistic, yet practical, application of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) based on Gherkin-like style, which allows the requirements engineer to specify requirements and to extract information about model elements(i.e. states and transitions). This is done to assist the graphical modelling of the complete system under test (SUT). Later stages of the workflow generates an executable test script that runs on a domain-specific simulation platform. We have evaluated this tool-supported workflow by specifying the requirements, extracting information from the DSL and developing a model of a subsystem of the train control management system developed at Alstom Transport AB in Sweden. The C# test script generated from the SUT model is successfully executed at the Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) execution platform and test verdicts are visualized as a sequence of passed and failed test steps.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472672.3473956;;;Systems AND Control
Resolute assurance arguments for cyber assured systems engineering;;;['Isaac Amundson', 'Darren Cofer'];;;May 2021;;;Destion '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Design Automation for CPS and IoT;;;Resolute is a tool and language for embedding an assurance argument in a system architecture model and evaluating the validity of the associated evidence. In this paper we report on a number of extensions to Resolute that support systems engineers in developing safe and cyber-resilient systems. System requirements are imported as assurance goals to be satisfied. Architectural transforms are applied to the system model to address these requirements, while corresponding assurance strategies and evidence are automatically added to document how the requirements have been satisfied. Subsequent changes to the model that invalidate any of the assurance claims can be detected and corrected. We also use Resolute to check that the model satisfies rules for code generation and other modeling guidelines. We conclude with an application of the Resolute assurance process to the design of a mission planning system for an unmanned air vehicle.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445034.3460507;;;Systems AND Control
Expanding Explainability: Towards Social Transparency in AI systems;;;['Upol Ehsan', 'Q. Vera Liao', 'Michael Muller', 'Mark O. Riedl', 'Justin D. Weisz'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;As AI-powered systems increasingly mediate consequential decision-making, their explainability is critical for end-users to take informed and accountable actions. Explanations in human-human interactions are socially-situated. AI systems are often socio-organizationally embedded. However, Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have been predominantly algorithm-centered. We take a developmental step towards socially-situated XAI by introducing and exploring Social Transparency (ST), a sociotechnically informed perspective that incorporates the socio-organizational context into explaining AI-mediated decision-making. To explore ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST’s effect and implications at the technical, decision-making, and organizational level. The framework showcases how ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability. Our work contributes to the discourse of Human-Centered XAI by expanding the design space of XAI.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445188;;;Systems AND Control
Distributed deep learning on data systems: a comparative analysis of approaches;;;['Yuhao Zhang', 'Frank McQuillan', 'Nandish Jayaram', 'Nikhil Kak', 'Ekta Khanna', 'Orhan Kislal', 'Domino Valdano', 'Arun Kumar'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment;;;Deep learning (DL) is growing in popularity for many data analytics applications, including among enterprises. Large business-critical datasets in such settings typically reside in RDBMSs or other data systems. The DB community has long aimed to bring machine learning (ML) to DBMS-resident data. Given past lessons from in-DBMS ML and recent advances in scalable DL systems, DBMS and cloud vendors are increasingly interested in adding more DL support for DB-resident data. Recently, a new parallel DL model selection execution approach called Model Hopper Parallelism (MOP) was proposed. In this paper, we characterize the particular suitability of MOP for DL on data systems, but to bring MOP-based DL to DB-resident data, we show that there is no single "best" approach, and an interesting tradeoff space of approaches exists. We explain four canonical approaches and build prototypes upon Greenplum Database, compare them analytically on multiple criteria (e.g., runtime efficiency and ease of governance) and compare them empirically with large-scale DL workloads. Our experiments and analyses show that it is non-trivial to meet all practical desiderata well and there is a Pareto frontier; for instance, some approaches are 3x-6x faster but fare worse on governance and portability. Our results and insights can help DBMS and cloud vendors design better DL support for DB users.

Exploiting an Optimal Delay-Collision Tradeoff in CSMA-Based High-Dense Wireless Systems;;;['Nicola Cordeschi', 'Floriano De Rango', 'Mauro Tropea'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;A novel carrier sense multiple access strategy with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) balancing contention probability and channel access time is proposed. The approach can be applied to any context where the computational simplicity of the MAC must be preferred to the complexity of the channel access strategy. Our MAC, called Delay-Collision CSMA (DC-CSMA), is a slotted nonpersistent CSMA/CA with nonuniform contention probability distribution, designed to reduce at the same time latency of contenders and preserve a high successful access probability. An utility function aiming at equalizing the effects of these two performance metrics is introduced, and the related theoretical properties and optimal distribution are derived. DC-CSMA is insensitive to the number of contenders and very robust with respect to contention window size, packet length, and impairments such as frame synchronization errors and hidden terminals, and it does not require any adaptive tuning to optimize its performance. Current technologies such as WSN, RFID, IoT devices can benefit from such a simple access technique. The numerical evaluation has been led out considering latency, successful probability and throughput, and DC-CSMA has been compared with other classical strategies such as CSMA with uniformly distributed contention probability, CSMA/<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$p^{\ast}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and Sift distribution.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3089825;;;Systems AND Control

Blockchain-enabled Tensor-based Conditional Deep Convolutional GAN for Cyber-physical-Social Systems;;;['Jun Feng', 'Laurence T. Yang', 'Yuxiang Zhu', 'Nicholaus J. Gati', 'Yijun Mo'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Internet Technology;;;Deep learning techniques have shown significant success in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). As an instance of deep learning models, generative adversarial nets (GAN) model enables powerful and flexible image augmentation, image generation, and classification, thus can be applied to real-world CPSS settings. GAN model training needs a large collection of cyber-physical-social data originating from various CPSS devices. Numerous prevailing GAN models depend on a tacit assumption that several cyber-physical-social data providers present a reliable source to collect training data, which is seldom the case in real CPSS. The existing GAN models also fail to consider multi-dimensional latent structure. In our work, we put forward a novel blockchain-enabled tensor-based conditional deep convolutional GAN (TCDC-GAN) model for cyber-physical-social systems. The blockchain is employed to develop a decentralized and reliable cyber-physical-social data-sharing platform between numerous cyber-physical-social data providers, such that the training data and the model are documented on a ledger that is distributed. Furthermore, a tensor-based generator and a tensor-based discriminator are well designed by employing the tensor model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show the efficacy of the proposed TCDC-GAN model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, our model gains superior estimation performance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404890;;;Systems AND Control
Teaching-Learning Interaction: A New Concept for Interaction Design to Support Reflective User Agency in Intelligent Systems;;;['Hankyung Kim', 'Youn-kyung Lim'];;;June 2021;;;DIS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference;;;Intelligent systems in everyday lives learn about their users to tailor services over time. However, these systems are often designed with little consideration of user agency on their learning processes, hindering users from taking full advantage of the systems. In this paper, we propose Teaching-Learning Interaction (TLI) as a new form of interaction that affords user agency by letting users reflectively shepherd an intelligent system’s manner of learning. Given such agency, users will be able to better personalize services for themselves. We first draw on Schön’s notion of knowing-in-action and reflective practice to theoretically ground our concept. We then present the resulting definition of TLI and three design qualities, which are further concretized with three design examples. We end with discussion on the implications of TLI for HCI design.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461778.3462141;;;Systems AND Control

QuickSilver: modeling and parameterized verification for distributed agreement-based systems;;;['Nouraldin Jaber', 'Christopher Wagner', 'Swen Jacobs', 'Milind Kulkarni', 'Roopsha Samanta'];;;October 2021;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages;;;The last decade has sparked several valiant efforts in deductive verification of distributed agreement protocols such as consensus and leader election. Oddly, there have been far fewer verification efforts that go beyond the core protocols and target applications that are built on top of agreement protocols. This is unfortunate, as agreement-based distributed services such as data stores, locks, and ledgers are ubiquitous and potentially permit modular, scalable verification approaches that mimic their modular design. We address this need for verification of distributed agreement-based systems through our novel modeling and verification framework, QuickSilver, that is not only modular, but also fully automated. The key enabling feature of QuickSilver is our encoding of abstractions of verified agreement protocols that facilitates modular, decidable, and scalable automated verification. We demonstrate the potential of QuickSilver by modeling and efficiently verifying a series of tricky case studies, adapted from real-world applications, such as a data store, a lock service, a surveillance system, a pathfinding algorithm for mobile robots, and more.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485534;;;Systems AND Control
SLA definition for network intrusion detection systems in IaaS clouds;;;['Amir Teshome Wonjiga', 'Louis Rilling', 'Christine Morin'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;Migrating to the cloud results in losing full control of the physical infrastructure as the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for managing the infrastructure including its security. To solve the trust issue that this raises, CSPs provide tenants with guarantees through Service Level Agreements (SLA). However no such SLA addresses the security monitoring aspect of tenants' information systems. Moreover, security monitoring services should be configured according to the tenant's specific requirements. In this paper, we propose a method allowing CSPs to define SLAs providing each tenant with guarantees about the performance of a security monitoring probe, specifically a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), configured according to the tenant's requirements. This method is based on an enhanced cloud SLA language and an efficient SLA template preparation method allowing a CSP to estimate the performance of an NIDS for any possible set of tenant's requirements at reasonable costs.

DIY: Assessing the Correctness of Natural Language to SQL Systems;;;['Arpit Narechania', 'Adam Fourney', 'Bongshin Lee', 'Gonzalo Ramos'];;;April 2021;;;IUI '21: 26th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces;;;Designing natural language interfaces for querying databases remains an important goal pursued by researchers in natural language processing, databases, and HCI. These systems receive natural language as input, translate it into a formal database query, and execute the query to compute a result. Because the responses from these systems are not always correct, it is important to provide people with mechanisms to assess the correctness of the generated query and computed result. However, this assessment can be challenging for people who lack expertise in query languages. We present Debug-It-Yourself (DIY), an interactive technique that enables users to assess the responses from a state-of-the-art natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) system for correctness and, if possible, fix errors. DIY provides users with a sandbox where they can interact with (1) the mappings between the question and the generated query, (2) a small-but-relevant subset of the underlying database, and (3) a multi-modal explanation of the generated query. End-users can then employ a back-of-the-envelope calculation debugging strategy to evaluate the system’s response. Through an exploratory study with 12 users, we investigate how DIY helps users assess the correctness of the system’s answers and detect & fix errors. Our observations reveal the benefits of DIY while providing insights about end-user debugging strategies and underscore opportunities for further improving the user experience.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3397481.3450667;;;Systems AND Control
A Modular End-to-End Framework for Secure Firmware Updates on Embedded Systems;;;['Solon Falas', 'Charalambos Konstantinou', 'Maria K. Michael'];;;None;;;ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems;;;Firmware refers to device read-only resident code which includes microcode and macro-instruction-level routines. For Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices without an operating system, firmware includes all the necessary instructions on how such embedded systems operate and communicate. Thus, firmware updates are essential parts of device functionality. They provide the ability to patch vulnerabilities, address operational issues, and improve device reliability and performance during the lifetime of the system. This process, however, is often exploited by attackers in order to inject malicious firmware code into the embedded device. In this article, we present a framework for secure firmware updates on embedded systems. This approach is based on hardware primitives and cryptographic modules, and it can be deployed in environments where communication channels might be insecure. The implementation of the framework is flexible, as it can be adapted in regards to the IoT device’s available hardware resources and constraints. Our security analysis shows that our framework is resilient to a variety of attack vectors. The experimental setup demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. By implementing a variety of test cases on FPGA, we demonstrate the adaptability and performance of the framework. Experiments indicate that the update procedure for a 1183-kB firmware image could be achieved, in a secure manner, under 1.73 seconds.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460234;;;Systems AND Control
Constrained Dual-Level Bandit for Personalized Impression Regulation in Online Ranking Systems;;;['Zhao Li', 'Junshuai Song', 'Zehong Hu', 'Zhen Wang', 'Jun Gao'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data;;;Impression regulation plays an important role in various online ranking systems, e.g., e-commerce ranking systems always need to achieve local commercial demands on some pre-labeled target items like fresh item cultivation and fraudulent item counteracting while maximizing its global revenue. However, local impression regulation may cause “butterfly effects” on the global scale, e.g., in e-commerce, the price preference fluctuation in initial conditions (overpriced or underpriced items) may create a significantly different outcome, thus affecting shopping experience and bringing economic losses to platforms. To prevent “butterfly effects”, some researchers define their regulation objectives with global constraints, by using contextual bandit at the page-level that requires all items on one page sharing the same regulation action, which fails to conduct impression regulation on individual items. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a personalized impression regulation method that can directly makes regulation decisions for each user-item pair. Specifically, we model the regulation problem as a Constrained Dual-level Bandit (CDB) problem, where the local regulation action and reward signals are at the item-level while the global effect constraint on the platform impression can be calculated at the page-level only. To handle the asynchronous signals, we first expand the page-level constraint to the item-level and then derive the policy updating as a second-order cone optimization problem. Our CDB approaches the optimal policy by iteratively solving the optimization problem. Experiments are performed on both offline and online datasets, and the results, theoretically and empirically, demonstrate CDB outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461340;;;Systems AND Control
Engineering Trustable and Auditable Choreography-based Systems Using Blockchain;;;['Flavio Corradini', 'Alessandro Marcelletti', 'Andrea Morichetta', 'Andrea Polini', 'Barbara Re', 'Francesco Tiezzi'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems;;;A key challenge in engineering distributed systems consists in the integration into their development of a decentralised infrastructure allowing the system participants to trust each other. In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3505225;;;Systems AND Control

In current AR HMDs, there are still two main open challenges to overcome for efficient and usable text entry: arm fatigue due to mid-air input and visual occlusion because of their small see-through displays. To address these challenges, we present iText, a technique for AR HMDs that is hands-free and is based on an imaginary (invisible) keyboard. We first show that it is feasible and practical to use an imaginary keyboard on AR HMDs. Then, we evaluated its performance and usability with three hands-free selection mechanisms: eye blinks (E-Type), dwell (D-Type), and swipe gestures (G-Type). Our results show that users could achieve an average text entry speed of 11.95, 9.03 and 9.84 words per minutes (WPM) with E-Type, D-Type, and G-Type, respectively. Given that iText with E-Type outperformed the other two selection mechanisms in text entry rate and subjective feedback, we ran a third, 5-day study. Our results show that iText with E-Type can achieve an average text entry rate of 13.76 WPM with a mean word error rate of 1.5%. In short, iText can enable efficient eyes-free text entry and can be useful for various application scenarios in AR HMDs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472749.3474788;;;Systems AND Control
A Holistic Solution for Reliability of 3D Parallel Systems;;;['Javad Bagherzadeh', 'Aporva Amarnath', 'Jielun Tan', 'Subhankar Pal', 'Ronald G. Dreslinski'];;;None;;;ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems;;;Monolithic 3D technology is emerging as a promising solution that can bring massive opportunities, but the gains can be hindered due to the reliability issues exaggerated by high temperature. Conventional reliability solutions focus on one specific feature and assume that the other required features would be provided by different solutions. Hence, this assumption has resulted in solutions that are proposed in isolation of each other and fail to consider the overall compatibility and the implied overheads of multiple isolated solutions for one system.This article proposes a holistic reliability management engine, R2D3, for post-Moore’s M3D parallel systems that have low yield and high failure rate. The proposed engine, comprising a controller, reconfigurable crossbars, and detection circuitry, provides concurrent single-replay detection and diagnosis, fault-mitigating repair, and aging-aware lifetime management at runtime. This holistic view enables us to create a solution that is highly effective while achieving a low overhead. Our solution achieves 96% coverage of defect; reduces Vth degradation by 53%, leading to a 78% performance improvement on average over 8 years for an eight-core system; and ultimately yields a 2.16× longer mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) while incurring an overhead of 7.4% in area, 6.5% in power, and an 8.2% decrease in frequency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488900;;;Systems AND Control
HiPa: Hierarchical Partitioning for Fast PageRank on NUMA Multicore Systems;;;['YuAng Chen', 'Yeh-ching Chung'];;;August 2021;;;ICPP '21: Proceedings of the 50th International Conference on Parallel Processing;;;PageRank, weighing the importance of vertices in a graph, serves as an fundamental algorithm for graph-structured tasks in a variety of domains. However, the processing capacity of multicore systems is oftentimes poorly utilized for large-scale PageRank due to the irregular memory accesses and poor cache efficiency. In this paper, we present HiPa, a novel hierarchical partitioning methodology to accelerate PageRank by utilizing the memory-cache architecture of the multicore system. For the shared memory, HiPa subdivides the graph based on the NUMA characteristics to reduce remote memory access while ensuring workload balance. For the private cache, HiPa further splits the graph into cache-able partitions to promote in-core computing and cache locality. Based on the partitioning strategy, systematical optimizations are proposed, such as thread management and new data layout. These effectively alleviate thread migration and thread contention, thus enhancing the scalability of HiPa. The integration of NUMA- and cache-aware parallelism allows HiPa to harness the potential of multicore systems. The performance of HiPa is evaluated by comparing with the the start-of-the-art graph frameworks and hand-optimized implementations. Over the best among them, HiPa achieves accelerations from 1.11 × to 1.45 × , and reductions in remote memory accesses from 1.87 × to 3.90 × . Moreover, we investigate the behaviors of HiPa on different processor micro-architectures to push its performance closer to hardware limit.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472456.3475737;;;Systems AND Control

Research shows that tailoring these systems increases their effectiveness. However, there is little knowledge on how PS can be tailored to people's Stages of Change (SoC). We conduct a large-scale study of 568 participants to investigate how individuals at different SoC respond to various strategies. We also explore why the strategies motivate behaviour change using the ARCS motivation model. Our results show that people's SoC plays a significant role in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies and that the strategies motivate for different reasons. For instance, people at the precontemplation stage tend to be strongly motivated by self-monitoring strategy because it raises their consciousness or self-awareness. Our work is the first to link research on the theory of SoC with the theory of motivation and Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) model to develop practical guidelines to inform the tailoring of persuasive systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445619;;;Systems AND Control
Side Information Fusion for Recommender Systems over Heterogeneous Information Network;;;['Huan Zhao', 'Quanming Yao', 'Yangqiu Song', 'James T. Kwok', 'Dik Lun Lee'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data;;;Collaborative filtering (CF) has been one of the most important and popular recommendation methods, which aims at predicting users’ preferences (ratings) based on their past behaviors. Recently, various types of side information beyond the explicit ratings users give to items, such as social connections among users and metadata of items, have been introduced into CF and shown to be useful for improving recommendation performance. However, previous works process different types of information separately, thus failing to capture the correlations that might exist across them. To address this problem, in this work, we study the application of heterogeneous information network (HIN), which offers a unifying and flexible representation of different types of side information, to enhance CF-based recommendation methods. However, we face challenging issues in HIN-based recommendation, i.e., how to capture similarities of complex semantics between users and items in a HIN, and how to effectively fuse these similarities to improve final recommendation performance. To address these issues, we apply metagraph to similarity computation and solve the information fusion problem with a “matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM)” framework. For the MF part, we obtain the user-item similarity matrix from each metagraph and then apply low-rank matrix approximation to obtain latent features for both users and items. For the FM part, we apply FM with Group lasso (FMG) on the features obtained from the MF part to train the recommending model and, at the same time, identify the useful metagraphs. Besides FMG, a two-stage method, we further propose an end-to-end method, hierarchical attention fusing, to fuse metagraph-based similarities for the final recommendation. Experimental results on four large real-world datasets show that the two proposed frameworks significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation performance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3441446;;;Systems AND Control

Private Data Exfiltration from Cyber-Physical Systems Using Channel State Information;;;['Thomas Burton', 'Kasper Rasmussen'];;;November 2021;;;WPES '21: Proceedings of the 20th Workshop on Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society;;;Data exfiltration methods aim to extract data without authorization from a network or device without detection. In this paper, we present a novel data exfiltration method using Channel State Information (CSI) from ambient WiFi signals. Modulation is performed by modifying the environment by moving a physically actuated machine resulting in a change to the channel response that is measurable by a distant receiver capable of collecting CSI samples. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate data when transmission using conventional methods is impossible, yet the attacker controls a moving mechanism. We discuss the design of the covert channel in detail and produce a proof of concept implementation to evaluate the performance in terms of communication quality. We find that even a simple implementation provides robust communication in an office environment.

In this the STAMINA platform design, and discuss the envisioned system initially from a holistic point of view. Our aim is to elaborate on (i) Standards that will be followed during the implementation and the deployment of the individual tools and the platform.

Hierarchical planning for resource allocation in emergency response systems;;;['Geoffrey Pettet', 'Ayan Mukhopadhyay', 'Mykel J. Kochenderfer', 'Abhishek Dubey'];;;May 2021;;;ICCPS '21: Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;A classical problem in city-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) is resource allocation under uncertainty. Typically, such problems are modeled as Markov (or semi-Markov) decision processes. While online, offline, and decentralized approaches have been applied to such problems, they have difficulty scaling to large decision problems. We present a general approach to hierarchical planning that leverages structure in city-level CPS problems for resource allocation under uncertainty. We use emergency response as a case study and show how a large resource allocation problem can be split into smaller problems. We then create a principled framework for solving the smaller problems and tackling the interaction between them. Finally, we use real-world data from Nashville, Tennessee, a major metropolitan area in the United States, to validate our approach. Our experiments show that the proposed approach out-performs state-of-the-art approaches used in the field of emergency response.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450267.3450543;;;Systems AND Control
Enabling near-data processing in distributed object storage systems;;;['Ian F. Adams', 'Neha Agrawal', 'Michael P. Mesnier'];;;July 2021;;;HotStorage '21: Proceedings of the 13th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Storage and File Systems;;;Most general-purpose distributed storage systems are not designed with near data processing (NDP) in mind. They do not respect semantic data boundaries when writing data, for example splitting a record across servers. This reduces NDP effectiveness by requiring data collation before computation. While semantic data awareness and NDP functions can be retroactively added to existing distributed storage, it is often complex and difficult to accomplish in practice. We propose sharing storage system layout information with data writers so they can adjust data layouts to prevent data alignment issues regardless of the underlying architectures. By doing so, we can simplify NDP implementation by reducing the need for data reassembly, and reduce the need for complex storage system or application extensions. We demonstrate a hinting mechanism on both HDFS with computational block storage and an erasure coded MinIO deployment, reducing data movement by up to 99% when querying CSV data with NDP co-located with the stored data. This was accomplished purely with client side data alignment, no modifications to the server side write paths, and no inter-node collation of data.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465332.3470881;;;Systems AND Control
Design Patterns for Submission Evaluation within E-Assessment Systems;;;['Michael Striewe'];;;July 2021;;;EuroPLoP'21: 26th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs;;;Many software systems in the area of educational technology can produce grades or other kind of feedback for students’ submissions automatically. Depending on the context of a particular system, there are different software engineering challenges regarding performance or flexibility of the submission evaluation process. During the experimental design of educational technology, these challenges and their consequences are often not considered appropriately, which leads to sub-optimal design decisions that limit productive use. This paper establishes a pattern catalogue that captures available design choices and their consequences in order to support developers and researchers in the domain of educational technology in making their design decisions. Two small case studies demonstrate the usefulness of the catalogue and the gains from applying appropriate patterns for each context.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3489449.3490010;;;Systems AND Control
Service Portability and Information Discovery in Building Operating Systems using Semantic Modeling;;;['Jakob Hviid', 'Aslak Johansen', 'Gabe Fierro', 'Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard'];;;November 2021;;;IoT '21: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on the Internet of Things;;;To achieve cost-efficient IoT based Building Operating Systems (BOS), portable building services are needed. Most previous work has gone into hardware abstraction, while service abstraction has been neglected. This paper presents an information discovery mechanism for BOSs that is based on an ontology which integrates with other semantic models used in the space. The built environment is characterized by extreme heterogeneity; no buildings are entirely alike. Equipment is replaced or updated, control systems and building functionality evolve, as applications, models, forecasters, and controllers improve. For services deployed in such settings to operate at a scale, they must be robust to change. Describing service interfaces using a semantic model, together with the physical context in a building, enables applications to query for their service dependencies. Applications then depend on an abstract query, instead of specific services. For evaluation, nine services running on models of the service ecosystems of three concrete buildings, are implemented, demonstrated, and discussed. Results show services have successfully been made portable and adapts to the changing environments of buildings. Merging and splitting services without code changes to depending services also work as intended, as well as increasing system resilience, by arbitrating similar services.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3494322.3494337;;;Systems AND Control

Interactive Emergency TeleHealth Systems in Pandemic Times: a Usability Evaluation in the Interior of Brazil;;;['Bruna Santana Capeleti', 'Gustavo Lopes Dominguete', 'Marluce Rodrigues Pereira', 'André Pimenta Freire'];;;October 2021;;;IHC '21: Proceedings of the XX Brazilian Symposium on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, people had to avoid crowded places and attend hospitals, clinics, and doctors' offices only in an emergency. The authors' institution developed a telehealth platform prototype in a joint effort between Health and Computer Science researchers and students to allow the participation of medical students under the supervision of medical professors to provide emergency health advice using online remote care supported by a video and form-filling tool to support in preliminary diagnosis. This paper presents a usability evaluation of the telehealth platform prototype involving 30 participants in a medium-sized town in the interior of Brazil. Participants simulated virtual consultations about COVID-19 with health professionals. The usability evaluations were fundamental to understanding users' mental models, how to provide a better experience and measuring the system's effectiveness and acceptance. The findings show implications to the design of telehealth systems and the impact of problems related to Information Architecture, user feedback, controlling video-based interfaces. The preliminary results encountered in the present study are essential to help improve the usability of telehealth solutions, which will have a significant growth following the trend from the COVID-19 pandemic.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472301.3484337;;;Systems AND Control
Learning optimal decisions for stochastic hybrid systems;;;['Mathis Niehage', 'Arnd Hartmanns', 'Anne Remke'];;;November 2021;;;MEMOCODE '21: Proceedings of the 19th ACM-IEEE International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for System Design;;;We apply reinforcement learning to approximate the optimal probability that a stochastic hybrid system satisfies a temporal logic formula. We consider systems with (non)linear continuous dynamics, random events following general continuous probability distributions, and discrete nondeterministic choices. We present a discretized view of states to the learner, but simulate the continuous system. Once we have learned a near-optimal scheduler resolving the choices, we use statistical model checking to estimate its probability of satisfying the formula. We implemented the approach using Q-learning in the tools HYPEG and modes, which support Petri net- and hybrid automata-based models, respectively. Via two case studies, we show the feasibility of the approach, and compare its performance and effectiveness to existing analytical techniques for a linear model. We find that our new approach quickly finds near-optimal prophetic as well as non-prophetic schedulers, which maximize or minimize the probability that a specific signal temporal logic property is satisfied.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487212.3487339;;;Systems AND Control

Simulation offers a way to deal with the resulting complexity by approximating the real system in a tractable and interpretable manner. Existing methods do not fully incorporate the interactions between user history, recommendation quality, and subsequent visits. We develop Accordion, a trainable simulator based on Poisson processes that can model visit patterns to an interactive system over time from large-scale data. New methods for training and simulation are developed and tested on two datasets of real world interactive systems. Accordion shows greater sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and offline A/B testing than comparison methods, an important step in building realistic task-oriented simulators for recommendation.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460231.3474259;;;Systems AND Control

In fact, MAS have found multiple applications, including the design and development of complex, hierarchical and critical systems. However, ensuring the accuracy of complex interactions and the correct execution of activities of a MAS is becoming a tedious task. In this work, we focus on the formal specification of interaction, holonic and sociotechnical concepts to the BRS-MAS model. The proposed approach, is based on Bigraphical reactive systems. Bigraphs, provide means to specify at same time locality and connectivity of different type of system ranging from soft systems to cyber physical systems. In addition, to its intuitive graphical representation, it provides algebraic definition. This, makes the resulted specifications more precise. Further, it enables the verification of the specified system at the design time (before the implementation) using verification tools.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3467707.3467762;;;Systems AND Control

Anytime ellipsoidal over-approximation of forward reach sets of uncertain linear systems;;;['Shadi Haddad', 'Abhishek Halder'];;;May 2021;;;CAADCPS '21: Proceedings of the Workshop on Computation-Aware Algorithmic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Computing tight over-approximation of reach sets of a controlled uncertain dynamical system is a common practice in verification of safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS).

MSYNC: A Generalized Formal Design Pattern for Virtually Synchronous Multirate Cyber-physical Systems;;;['Kyungmin Bae', 'Peter Csaba Ölveczky'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;TTA and PALS are two prominent formal design patterns—with different strengths and weaknesses—for virtually synchronous distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs). They greatly simplify the design and verification of such systems by allowing us to design and verify their underlying synchronous designs. In this paper we introduce and verify MSYNC as a formal design (and verification) pattern/synchronizer for hierarchical multirate CPSs that generalizes, and combines the advantages of, both TTA and (single-rate and multirate) PALS. We also define an extension of TTA to multirate CPSs as a special case. We show that MSYNC outperforms both TTA and PALS in terms of allowing shorter periods, and illustrate the MSYNC design and verification approach with a case study on a fault-tolerant distributed control system for turning an airplane.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477036;;;Systems AND Control

The long-tail data-driven financial recommender systems;;;['Igor Klioutchnikov', 'Oleg Kliuchnikov'];;;March 2021;;;DEFIN-2021: IV International Scientific and Practical Conference;;;Long-tailed financial recommender systems, are attracting attention for their many applications in online services. Such systems demonstrate their ability to better accommodate the interests of network users and offer greater promise for better meeting their financial service needs. In this article, the authors discuss some approaches to using the information contained in the long tail of requests from web users interested in obtaining online financial services. This article answers the question of why user tail queries are starting to play an important role in financial recommendation systems? And how they correspond to the interests of social media users and how they are taken into account and participate in the development of recommendations by financial intermediaries. A hypothesis is put forward: Long-tail data (LTD) as a way to improve the accuracy of financial recommendations (R) generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN). For this, the most typical consumer data (ND) included in normal distributions are processed by generative filters (GM) and corrected by the discriminator model (DM). ND → GM; LTD → DM → GM → R. Long-tail data improves the accuracy of financial advice, expands the client base, and increases the availability of financial services.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487757.3490890;;;Systems AND Control

To face these new challenges IT technologies and their application to environmental intelligent monitoring become into a powerful tool to set new policies and blueprints to contribute to social good. In the new H2020 project, WatchPlant will provide new tools for environmental intelligence monitoring by the use of plants as "well-being" sensors of the environment they inhabit. This will be possible by equipping plants with a net of communicated wireless self-powered sensors, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) to become plants into "biohybrid organisms" to test exposure-effects links between plant and the environment. It will become plants into a new tool to be aware of the environment status in a very early stage towards in-situ monitoring. Additionally, the system is devoted to be sustainable and energy-efficient thanks to the use of clean energy sources such as solar cells and a enzymatic biofuel cell (BFC) together with its self-deployment, self-awareness, adaptation, artificial evolution and the AI capabilities. In this concept paper, WatchPlant will envision how to face this challenge by joining interdisciplinary efforts to access the plant sap for energy harvesting and sensing purposes and become plants into "biohybrid organisms" to benefit social good in terms of environmental monitoring in urban scenarios.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462203.3475885;;;Systems AND Control
Evaluating Human-AI Hybrid Conversational Systems with Chatbot Message Suggestions;;;['Zihan Gao', 'Jiepu Jiang'];;;October 2021;;;CIKM '21: Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information &amp; Knowledge Management;;;AI chatbots can offer suggestions to help humans answer questions by reducing text entry effort and providing relevant knowledge for unfamiliar questions. We study whether chatbot suggestions can help people answer knowledge-demanding questions in a conversation and influence response quality and efficiency. We conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing user study and evaluated 20 hybrid system variants and a human-only baseline. The hybrid systems used four chatbots of varied response quality and differed in the number of suggestions and whether to preset the message box with top suggestions.   Experimental results show that chatbot suggestions---even using poor-performing chatbots---have consistently improved response efficiency. Compared with the human-only setting, hybrid systems have reduced response time by 12%--35% and keystrokes by 33%--60%, and users have adopted a suggestion for the final response without any changes in 44%--68% of the cases. In contrast, crowd workers in the human-only setting typed most of the response texts and copied 5% of the answers from other sites.   However, we also found that chatbot suggestions did not always help response quality. Specifically, in hybrid systems equipped with poor-performing chatbots, users responded with lower-quality answers than others in the human-only setting. It seems that users would not simply ignore poor suggestions and compose responses as they could without seeing the suggestions. Besides, presetting the message box has improved reply efficiency without hurting response quality. We did not find that showing more suggestions helps or hurts response quality or efficiency consistently. Our study reveals how and when AI chatbot suggestions can help people answer questions in hybrid conversational systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459637.3482340;;;Systems AND Control

Standing in Your Shoes: External Assessments for Personalized Recommender Systems;;;['Hongyu Lu', 'Weizhi Ma', 'Min Zhang', 'Maarten de Rijke', 'Yiqun Liu', 'Shaoping Ma'];;;July 2021;;;SIGIR '21: Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;;;The evaluation of recommender systems relies on user preference data, which is difficult to acquire directly because of its subjective nature. Current recommender systems widely utilize users' historical interactions as implicit or explicit feedback, but such data usually suffers from various types of bias. Little work has been done on collecting and understanding user's personal preferences via third-party annotations. External assessments, that is, annotations made by assessors who are not the systems' users, have been widely used in information search scenarios. Is it possible to use external assessments to construct user preference labels? This paper presents the first attempt to incorporate external assessments into preference labeling and recommendation evaluation. The aim is to verify the possibility and reliability of external assessments for personalized recommender systems. We collect both users' real preferences and assessors' estimated preferences through a multi-role, multi-session user study. By investigating the inter-assessor agreement and user-assessor consistency, we demonstrate the reasonable stability and high accuracy of external preference assessments. Furthermore, we investigate the usage of external assessments in system evaluation. A higher degree of consistency with users' online feedback is observed, even better than traditional history-based online evaluation. Our findings show that external assessments can be used for assessing user preference labels and evaluating systems in personalized recommendation scenarios.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3462916;;;Systems AND Control
Detailed black-box monitoring of distributed systems;;;['Francisco Neves', 'Ricardo Vilaça', 'José Pereira'];;;March 2021;;;ACM SIGAPP Applied Computing Review;;;Modern containerized distributed systems, such as big data storage and processing stacks or micro-service based applications, are inherently hard to monitor and optimize, as resource usage does not directly match hardware resources due to multiple virtualization layers. For instance, interapplication traffic is an important factor in as it directly indicates how components interact, it has not been possible to accurately monitor it in an application independent way and without severe overhead, thus putting it out of reach of cloud platforms.In this paper we present an efficient black-box monitoring approach for gathering detailed structural information of collaborating processes in a distributed system that can be queried for various purposes, as it includes both information about processes, containers, and hosts, as well as resource usage and amount of data exchanged. The key to achieving high detail and low overhead without custom application instrumentation is to use a kernel-aided event driven strategy. We validate a prototype implementation by applying it to multi-platform microservice deployments, evaluate its performance with micro-benchmarks, and demonstrate its usefulness for container placement in a distributed data storage and processing stack (i.e., Cassandra and Spark).;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477133.3477135;;;Systems AND Control

A way to enhance the user experience is using haptic props that make virtual objects graspable. But physical objects are only present in one location and cannot be manipulated directly by remote users. We explore different strategies to handle ownership of virtual objects enhanced by haptic props. In particular, two strategies of handling object ownership – SingleOwnership and SharedOwnership. SingleOwnership restricts virtual objects to local haptic props, while SharedOwnership allows collaborators to take over ownership of virtual objects using local haptic props. We study both strategies for a collaborative puzzle task regarding their influence on performance and user behavior. Our findings show that SingleOwnership increases communication and enhanced with virtual instructions, results in higher task completion times. SharedOwnership is less reliant on verbal communication and faster, but there is less social interaction between the collaborators.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485279.3485287;;;Systems AND Control
Approximate information state for approximate planning and reinforcement learning in partially observed systems;;;['Jayakumar Subramanian', 'Amit Sinha', 'Raihan Seraj', 'Aditya Mahajan'];;;None;;;The Journal of Machine Learning Research;;;We propose a theoretical framework for approximate planning and learning in partially observed systems. Our framework is based on the fundamental notion of information state. We provide two definitions of information state--i) a function of history which is sufficient to compute the expected reward and predict its next value; ii) a function of the history which can be recursively updated and is sufficient to compute the expected reward and predict the next observation. An information state always leads to a dynamic programming decomposition. Our key result is to show that if a function of the history (called approximate information state (AIS)) approximately satisfies the properties of the information state, then there is a corresponding approximate dynamic program. We show that the policy computed using this is approximately optimal with bounded loss of optimality. We show that several approximations in state, observation and action spaces in literature can be viewed as instances of AIS. In some of these cases, we obtain tighter bounds. A salient feature of AIS is that it can be learnt from data. We present AIS based multi-time scale policy gradient algorithms and detailed numerical experiments with low, moderate and high dimensional environments.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586589.3586601;;;Systems AND Control
The parallel lives of autonomous systems: ASN allocations vs. BGP;;;['Eugenio Nerio Nemmi', 'Francesco Sassi', 'Massimo La Morgia', 'Cecilia Testart', 'Alessandro Mei', 'Alberto Dainotti'];;;November 2021;;;IMC '21: Proceedings of the 21st ACM Internet Measurement Conference;;;Autonomous Systems (ASes) exist in two dimensions on the Internet: the administrative and the operational one. Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) rule the former, while BGP the latter. In this work, we reconstruct the lives of the ASes on both dimensions, performing a joint analysis that covers 17 years of data. For the administrative dimension, we leverage delegation files published by RIRs to report the daily status of Internet resources they allocate. For the operational dimension, we characterize the temporal activity of ASNs in the Internet control plane using BGP data collected by the RouteViews and RIPE RIS projects. We present a methodology to extract insights about AS life cycles, including dealing with pitfalls affecting authoritative public datasets. We then perform a joint analysis to establish the relationship (or lack of) between these two dimensions for all allocated ASNs and all ASNs visible in BGP. We characterize the usual behaviors, specific differences between RIRs and historical resources, as well as measure the discrepancies between the two "parallel" lives. We find discrepancies and misalignment that reveal useful insights, and we highlight through examples the potential of this new lens to help pinpoint malicious BGP activity and various types of misconfigurations. This study illuminates a largely unexplored aspect of the Internet global routing system and provides methods and data to support broader studies that relate to security, policy, and network management.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3487552.3487838;;;Systems AND Control
Soliciting Stakeholders’ Fairness Notions in Child Maltreatment Predictive Systems;;;['Hao-Fei Cheng', 'Logan Stapleton', 'Ruiqi Wang', 'Paige Bullock', 'Alexandra Chouldechova', 'Zhiwei Steven Steven Wu', 'Haiyi Zhu'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;Recent work in fair machine learning has proposed dozens of technical definitions of algorithmic fairness and methods for enforcing these definitions. However, we still lack an understanding of how to develop machine learning systems with fairness criteria that reflect relevant stakeholders’ nuanced viewpoints in real-world contexts. To address this gap, we propose a framework for eliciting stakeholders’ subjective fairness notions. Combining a user interface that allows stakeholders to examine the data and the algorithm’s predictions with an interview protocol to probe stakeholders’ thoughts while they are interacting with the interface, we can identify stakeholders’ fairness beliefs and principles. We conduct a user study to evaluate our framework in the setting of a child maltreatment predictive system. Our evaluations show that the framework allows stakeholders to comprehensively convey their fairness viewpoints.

Fast Multi-Step Critiquing for VAE-based Recommender Systems;;;['Diego Antognini', 'Boi Faltings'];;;September 2021;;;RecSys '21: Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems;;;Recent studies have shown that providing personalized explanations alongside recommendations increases trust and perceived quality. Furthermore, it gives users an opportunity to refine the recommendations by critiquing parts of the explanations. On one hand, current recommender systems model the recommendation, explanation, and critiquing objectives jointly, but this creates an inherent trade-off between their respective performance. On the other hand, although recent latent linear critiquing approaches are built upon an existing recommender system, they suffer from computational inefficiency at inference due to the objective optimized at each conversation’s turn. We address these deficiencies with M&Ms-VAE, a novel variational autoencoder for recommendation and explanation that is based on multimodal modeling assumptions. We train the model under a weak supervision scheme to simulate both fully and partially observed variables. Then, we leverage the generalization ability of a trained M&Ms-VAE model to embed the user preference and the critique separately. Our work’s most important innovation is our critiquing module, which is built upon and trained in a self-supervised manner with a simple ranking objective. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that among state-of-the-art models, our system is the first to dominate or match the performance in terms of recommendation, explanation, and multi-step critiquing. Moreover, M&Ms-VAE processes the critiques up to 25.6x faster than the best baselines. Finally, we show that our model infers coherent joint and cross generation, even under weak supervision, thanks to our multimodal-based modeling and training scheme.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460231.3474249;;;Systems AND Control
Exploration in Online Advertising Systems with Deep Uncertainty-Aware Learning;;;['Chao Du', 'Zhifeng Gao', 'Shuo Yuan', 'Lining Gao', 'Ziyan Li', 'Yifan Zeng', 'Xiaoqiang Zhu', 'Jian Xu', 'Kun Gai', 'Kuang-Chih Lee'];;;August 2021;;;KDD '21: Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining;;;Modern online advertising systems inevitably rely on personalization methods, such as click-through rate (CTR) prediction. Recent progress in CTR prediction enjoys the rich representation capabilities of deep learning and achieves great success in large-scale industrial applications. However, these methods can suffer from lack of exploration. Another line of prior work addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off problem with contextual bandit methods, which are recently less studied in the industry due to the difficulty in extending their flexibility with deep models. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL) method to learn CTR models based on Gaussian processes, which can provide predictive uncertainty estimations while maintaining the flexibility of deep neural networks. DUAL can be easily implemented on existing models and deployed in real-time systems with minimal extra computational overhead. By linking the predictive uncertainty estimation ability of DUAL to well-known bandit algorithms, we further present DUAL-based Ad-ranking strategies to boost up long-term utilities such as the social welfare in advertising systems. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Remarkably, an online A/B test deployed in the Alibaba display advertising platform shows an 8.2% social welfare improvement and an 8.0% revenue lift.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447548.3467089;;;Systems AND Control
Understanding and dealing with hard faults in persistent memory systems;;;['Brian Choi', 'Randal Burns', 'Peng Huang'];;;April 2021;;;EuroSys '21: Proceedings of the Sixteenth European Conference on Computer Systems;;;The advent of Persistent Memory (PM) devices enables systems to actively persist information at low costs, including program state traditionally in volatile memory. However, this trend poses a reliability challenge in which multiple classes of soft faults that go away after restart in traditional systems turn into hard (recurring) faults in PM systems. In this paper, we first characterize this rising problem with an empirical study of 28 real-world bugs. We analyze how they cause hard faults in PM systems. We then propose Arthas, a tool to effectively recover PM systems from hard faults. Arthas checkpoints PM states via fine-grained versioning and uses program slicing of fault instructions to revert problematic PM states to good versions. We evaluate Arthas on 12 real-world hard faults from five large PM systems. Arthas successfully recovers the systems for all cases while discarding 10× less data on average compared to state-of-the-art checkpoint-rollback solutions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456252;;;Systems AND Control

Firstly, the dataset is obtained through data enhancement for improve the generalization ability of the model, meanwhile, the Faster-RCNN model is improved, which increases the recognition accuracy by 4.38% compared with the previous improvement. Then, the improved model is used to detect the type and position of targets in real time, and the Filter Bank Canonical Correlation Analysis (FBCCA) algorithm is used to extract the features of the Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to control the robot arm to grasp the desired object. Finally, 12 subjects were recruited to test the system.

Comprehensive Characteristic Decomposition of Parametric Polynomial Systems;;;['Rina Dong', 'Dong Lu', 'Chenqi Mou', 'Dongming Wang'];;;July 2021;;;ISSAC '21: Proceedings of the 2021 on International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation;;;This paper presents an algorithm that decomposes an arbitrary set F of multivariate polynomials involving parameters into finitely many sets Γi of (lexicographical) Gröbner bases G ij such that associated with each Γi there is a system Ai of parametric constraints, all the Ai's partition the parameter space, all the Gij's in each Γi remain Gröbner bases under specialization of the parameters satisfying the constraints in Ai, and for each i the Gröbner bases Gij together with their corresponding W-characteristic sets form a normal characteristic decomposition of F. The sets of Gröbner bases computed by the algorithm provide a comprehensive characteristic decomposition of F that is structure-invariant under the associated constraints and possesses many algebraic and geometric properties, including most of the notable properties on comprehensive Gröbner systems and comprehensive triangular decomposition.

Targeting requirements violations of autonomous driving systems by dynamic evolutionary search;;;['Yixing Luo', 'Xiao-Yi Zhang', 'Paolo Arcaini', 'Zhi Jin', 'Haiyan Zhao', 'Fuyuki Ishikawa', 'Rongxin Wu', 'Tao Xie'];;;November 2021;;;ASE '21: Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering;;;Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are complex systems that must satisfy multiple requirements such as safety, compliance to traffic rules, and comfortableness. However, satisfying all these requirements may not always be possible due to emerging environmental conditions. Therefore, the ADSs may have to make trade-offs among multiple requirements during the ongoing operation, resulting in one or more requirements violations. For ADS engineers, it is highly important to know which combinations of requirements violations may occur, as different combinations can expose different types of failures. However, there is currently no testing approach that can generate scenarios to expose different combinations of requirements violations. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the notion of requirements violation pattern to characterize a specific combination of requirements violations. Based on this notion, we propose a testing approach named EMOOD that can effectively generate test scenarios to expose as many requirements violation patterns as possible. EMOOD uses a prioritization technique to sort all possible patterns to search for, from the most to the least critical ones. Then, EMOOD iteratively includes an evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm to find different combinations of requirements violations. In each iteration, the targeted pattern is determined by a dynamic prioritization technique to give preferences to those patterns with higher criticality and higher likelihood to occur. We apply EMOOD to an industrial ADS under two common traffic situations. Evaluation results show that EMOOD outperforms three baseline approaches in generating test scenarios by discovering more requirements violation patterns.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678883;;;Systems AND Control
Sparse Feature Factorization for Recommender Systems with Knowledge Graphs;;;['Vito Walter Anelli', 'Tommaso Di Noia', 'Eugenio Di Sciascio', 'Antonio Ferrara', 'Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino'];;;September 2021;;;RecSys '21: Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems;;;Deep Learning and factorization-based collaborative filtering recommendation models have undoubtedly dominated the scene of recommender systems in recent years. However, despite their outstanding performance, these methods require a training time proportional to the size of the embeddings and it further increases when also side information is considered for the computation of the recommendation list. In fact, in these cases we have that with a large number of high-quality features, the resulting models are more complex and difficult to train. This paper addresses this problem by presenting KGFlex: a sparse factorization approach that grants an even greater degree of expressiveness. To achieve this result, KGFlex analyzes the historical data to understand the dimensions the user decisions depend on (e.g., movie direction, musical genre, nationality of book writer). KGFlex represents each item feature as an embedding and it models user-item interactions as a factorized entropy-driven combination of the item attributes relevant to the user. KGFlex facilitates the training process by letting users update only those relevant features on which they base their decisions. In other words, the user-item prediction is mediated by the user’s personal view that considers only relevant features. An extensive experimental evaluation shows the approach’s effectiveness, considering the recommendation results’ accuracy, diversity, and induced bias. The public implementation of KGFlex is available at https://split.to/kgflex.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460231.3474243;;;Systems AND Control

Research in the field therefore highlights the need for transparency, scrutability, intelligibility, interpretability and explainability, among others. While all of these terms carry a vision of supporting users in understanding intelligent systems, the underlying notions and assumptions about users and their interaction with the system often remain unclear.  We review the literature in HCI through the lens of implied user questions to synthesise a conceptual framework integrating user mindsets, user involvement, and knowledge outcomes to reveal, differentiate and classify current notions in prior work. This framework aims to resolve conceptual ambiguity in the field and enables researchers to clarify their assumptions and become aware of those made in prior work.

Modern healthcare devices can monitor and manage different health conditions of patients automatically without any manual intervention from medical professionals. Additionally, the use of implantable medical devices, body area networks, and Internet of Things technologies in healthcare systems improve the overall patient monitoring and treatment process. However, these systems are complex in software and hardware, and optimizing between security, privacy, and treatment is crucial for healthcare systems because any security or privacy violation can lead to severe effects on patients’ treatments and overall health conditions. Indeed, the healthcare domain is increasingly facing security challenges and threats due to numerous design flaws and the lack of proper security measures in healthcare devices and applications. In this article, we explore various security and privacy threats to healthcare systems and discuss the consequences of these threats. We present a detailed survey of different potential attacks and discuss their impacts. Furthermore, we review the existing security measures proposed for healthcare systems and discuss their limitations.

Supervised Advantage Actor-Critic for Recommender Systems;;;['Xin Xin', 'Alexandros Karatzoglou', 'Ioannis Arapakis', 'Joemon M. Jose'];;;February 2022;;;WSDM '22: Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining;;;Casting session-based or sequential recommendation as reinforcement learning (RL) through reward signals is a promising research direction towards recommender systems (RS) that maximize cumulative profits. However, the direct use of RL algorithms in the RS setting is impractical due to challenges like off-policy training, huge action spaces and lack of sufficient reward signals. Recent RL approaches for RS attempt to tackle these challenges by combining RL and (self-)supervised sequential learning, but still suffer from certain limitations. For example, the estimation of Q-values tends to be biased toward positive values due to the lack of negative reward signals. Moreover, the Q-values also depend heavily on the specific timestamp of a sequence. To address the above problems, we propose negative sampling strategy for training the RL component and combine it with supervised sequential learning. We call this method Supervised Negative Q-learning (SNQN). Based on sampled (negative) actions (items), we can calculate the ''advantage'' of a positive action over the average case, which can be further utilized as a normalized weight for learning the supervised sequential part. This leads to another learning framework: Supervised Advantage Actor-Critic (SA2C). We instantiate SNQN and SA2C with four state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models and conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches achieve significantly better performance than state-of-the-art supervised methods and existing self-supervised RL methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488560.3498494;;;Systems AND Control
Conversational review-based explanations for recommender systems: Exploring users’ query behavior;;;['Diana C.

While static explanations are dominant, interactive explanatory approaches have emerged in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so that users are more likely to examine system decisions and get more arguments supporting system assertions. However, little attention has been paid to conversational approaches for explanations targeting end users. In this paper we explore how to design a conversational interface to provide explanations in a review-based RS, and present the results of a Wizard of Oz (WoOz) study that provided insights into the type of questions users might ask in such a context, as well as their perception of a system simulating such a dialog. Consequently, we propose a dialog management policy and user intents for explainable review-based RS, taking as an example the hotels domain.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3469595.3469596;;;Systems AND Control

Artificial Intelligence and the Purpose of Social Systems;;;['Sebastian Benthall', 'Jake Goldenfein'];;;July 2021;;;AIES '21: Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society;;;The law and ethics of Western democratic states have their basis in liberalism. This extends to regulation and ethical discussion of technology and businesses doing data processing. Liberalism relies on the privacy and autonomy of individuals, their ordering through a public market, and, more recently, a measure of equality guaranteed by the state. We argue that these forms of regulation and ethical analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data economy and artificial intelligence have transcended liberal legal imagination. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounded rationality of individuals and each other. This has led to the private consolidation of markets and an unequal hierarchy of control operating mainly for the purpose of shareholder value. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the purpose of the social system that operates it. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes. An attention cooperative, that prioritizes its incoming and outgoing data flows, is one model of a social system that could form and maintain its own autonomous purpose.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462526;;;Systems AND Control
BurstLink: Techniques for Energy-Efficient Video Display for Conventional and Virtual Reality Systems;;;['Jawad Haj-Yahya', 'Jisung Park', 'Rahul Bera', 'Juan Gómez Luna', 'Efraim Rotem', 'Taha Shahroodi', 'Jeremie Kim', 'Onur Mutlu'];;;October 2021;;;MICRO '21: MICRO-54: 54th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture;;;Conventional planar video streaming is the most popular application in mobile systems. The rapid growth of 360° video content and virtual reality (VR) devices is accelerating the adoption of VR video streaming. Unfortunately, video streaming consumes significant system energy due to high power consumption of major system components (e.g., DRAM, display interfaces, and display panel) involved in the video streaming process. For example, in conventional planar video streaming, the video decoder (in the processor) decodes video frames and stores them in the DRAM main memory before the display controller (in the processor) transfers decoded frames from DRAM to the display panel. This system architecture causes large amount of data movement to/from DRAM as well as high DRAM bandwidth usage. As a result, DRAM by itself consumes more than 30% of the video streaming energy.  We propose BurstLink, a novel system-level technique that improves the energy efficiency of planar and VR video streaming. BurstLink is based on two key ideas. First, BurstLink directly transfers a decoded video frame from the video decoder or the GPU to the display panel, completely bypassing the host DRAM. To this end, we extend the display panel with a double remote frame buffer (DRFB) instead of DRAM’s double frame buffer so that the system can directly update the DRFB with a new frame while updating the display panel’s pixels with the current frame stored in the DRFB. Second, BurstLink transfers a complete decoded frame to the display panel in a single burst, using the maximum bandwidth of modern display interfaces.  Unlike conventional systems where the frame transfer rate is limited by the pixel-update throughput of the display panel, BurstLink can always take full advantage of the high bandwidth of modern display interfaces by decoupling the frame transfer from the pixel update as enabled by the DRFB. This direct and burst frame transfer of capability BurstLink significantly reduces energy consumption of video display by 1) reducing accesses to DRAM, 2) increasing system’s residency at idle power states, and 3) enabling temporal power gating of several system components after quickly transferring each frame into the DRFB.  BurstLink can be easily implemented in modern mobile systems with minimal changes to the video display pipeline. We evaluate BurstLink using an analytical power model that we rigorously validate on an Intel Skylake mobile system. Our evaluation shows that BurstLink reduces system energy consumption for 4K planar and VR video streaming by 41% and 33%, respectively. BurstLink provides an even higher energy reduction in future video streaming systems with higher display resolutions and/or display refresh rates.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466752.3480085;;;Systems AND Control

Governing Algorithmic Systems with Impact Assessments: Six Observations;;;['Elizabeth Anne Watkins', 'Emanuel Moss', 'Jacob Metcalf', 'Ranjit Singh', 'Madeleine Clare Elish'];;;July 2021;;;AIES '21: Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society;;;Algorithmic decision-making and decision-support systems (ADS) are gaining influence over how society distributes resources, administers justice, and provides access to opportunities. Yet collectively we do not adequately study how these systems affect people or document the actual or potential harms resulting from their integration with important social functions. This is a significant challenge for computational justice efforts of measuring and governing AI systems. Impact assessments are often used as instruments to create accountability relationships and grant some measure of agency and voice to communities affected by projects with environmental, financial, and human rights ramifications. Applying these tools-through Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIA)-is a plausible way to establish accountability relationships for ADSs. At the same time, what an AIA would entail remains under-specified; they raise as many questions as they answer. Choices about the methods, scope, and purpose of AIAs structure the conditions of possibility for AI governance. In this paper, we present our research on the history of impact assessments across diverse domains, through a sociotechnical lens, to present six observations on how they co-constitute accountability. Decisions about what type of effects count as an impact; when impacts are assessed; whose interests are considered; who is invited to participate; who conducts the assessment; how assessments are made publicly available, and what the outputs of the assessment might be; all shape the forms of accountability that AIAs engender. Because AlAs are still an incipient governance strategy, approaching them as social constructions that do not require a single or universal approach offers a chance to produce interventions that emerge from careful deliberation.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462580;;;Systems AND Control
A Security and Privacy Validation Methodology for e-Health Systems;;;['Flora Amato', 'Valentina Casola', 'Giovanni Cozzolino', 'Alessandra De Benedictis', 'Nicola Mazzocca', 'Francesco Moscato'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications;;;e-Health applications enable one to acquire, process, and share patient medical data to improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient monitoring. Despite the undeniable benefits brought by the digitization of health systems, the transmission of and access to medical information raises critical issues, mainly related to security and privacy. While several security mechanisms exist that can be applied in an e-Health system, they may not be adequate due to the complexity of involved workflows, and to the possible inherent correlation among health-related concepts that may be exploited by unauthorized subjects. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for the validation of security and privacy policies in a complex e-Health system, that leverages a formal description of clinical workflows and a semantically enriched definition of the data model used by the workflows, in order to build a comprehensive model of the system that can be analyzed with automated model checking and ontology-based reasoning techniques. To validate the proposed methodology, we applied it to two case studies, subjected to the directives of the EU GDPR regulation for the protection of health data, and demonstrated its ability to correctly verify the fulfillment of desired policies in different scenarios.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412373;;;Systems AND Control
Hivemind: social control-and-use of IoT towards democratization of public spaces;;;['Wonjung Kim', 'Seungchul Lee', 'Youngjae Chang', 'Taegyeong Lee', 'Inseok Hwang', 'Junehwa Song'];;;June 2021;;;MobiSys '21: Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services;;;Public spaces are equipped with 'public actuators', e.g., HVAC, lighting fixtures, speakers, or streaming TV channels to ensure their visitors' comfort. However, many public actuators rarely allow the visitors to adjust their operation, limiting their utility and fairness across the visitors. Also, the social bar is often too high to speak up one's preference and attempt to change an actuator's operation. Social control and use of IoT devices is an underexplored new direction of research even with its huge potential and implication, but comes with high complexity and scale. This paper proposes a novel architecture, namely, Social Control-and-Use Architecture for IoT Devices, which provides a systematic view and an effective tool to handle the complication and intricacy in system design. It also proposes Hivemind, a first-of-a-kind system developed, upon the architecture, for sharing IoT-enabled actuators in a public space. It transforms an exclusively-controlled actuator in a public space into a true public actuator, supporting visitors to instantly participate in the democratic collective control. Also, a myriad of off-the-shelf actuators are easily incorporated without modification to their implementation. The field deployment of Hivemind shows its comprehensive service coverage as well as the users' approval on the democratic collective control of public actuators.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458864.3466626;;;Systems AND Control
OneEdge: An Efficient Control Plane for Geo-Distributed Infrastructures;;;['Enrique Saurez', 'Harshit Gupta', 'Alexandros Daglis', 'Umakishore Ramachandran'];;;November 2021;;;SoCC '21: Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing;;;Resource management for geo-distributed infrastructures is challenging due to the scarcity and non-uniformity of edge resources, as well as the high client mobility and workload surges inherent to situation awareness applications. Due to their centralized nature, state-of-the-art schedulers that work well in datacenters lack the performance and feature requirements of such applications. We present OneEdge, a hybrid control plane that enables autonomous decision-making at edge sites for localized, rapid single-site application deployment. Edge sites handle mobility, churn, and load spikes, by cooperating with a centralized controller that allows coordinated multi-site scheduling and dynamic reconfiguration. OneEdge's scheduling decisions are driven by each application's end-to-end service level objective (E2E SLO) as well as the specific requirements of situation awareness applications. OneEdge's novel distributed state management combines autonomous decision-making at the edge sites for rapid localized resource allocations with decision-making at the central controller when multi-site application deployment is needed. Using a mix of applications on multi-region Azure instances, we show that, in contrast to centralized or fully distributed control planes, OneEdge caters to the unique requirements of situation awareness applications. Compared to a centralized control plane, OneEdge reduces deployment latency by 66% for single-site applications, without compromising E2E SLOs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472883.3487008;;;Systems AND Control
The OpenMP API for High Integrity Systems: Moving Responsibility from Users to Vendors;;;['Michael Klemm', 'Eduardo Quiñones', 'Tucker Taft', 'Dirk Ziegenbein', 'Sara Royuela'];;;December 2020;;;ACM SIGAda Ada Letters;;;OpenMP is traditionally focused on boosting performance in HPC systems. However, other domains are showing an increasing interest in the use of OpenMP by virtue of key aspects introduced in recent versions of the specification: the tasking model, the accelerator model, and other features like the requires and the assumes directives, which allow defining certain contracts. One example is the safety-critical embedded domain, where several efforts have been initiated towards the adoption of OpenMP. However, the OpenMP specification states that "application developers are responsible for correctly using the OpenMP API to produce a conforming program", being not acceptable in high integrity systems, where aspects such as reliability and resiliency have to be ensured at different levels of criticality. In this scope, programming languages like Ada propose a different paradigm by exposing fewer features to the user, and leaving the responsibility of safely exploiting the full underlying architecture to the compiler and the runtime systems, instead. The philosophy behind this kind of model is to move the responsibility of producing correct parallel programs from users to vendors.In this panel, actors from different domains involved in the use of parallel programming models for the development of high-integrity systems share their thoughts about this topic.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3463478.3463480;;;Systems AND Control

Such systems have the potential to bring a wide range of benefits, blending advanced functionality with the physical environment. However, these systems also have the potential to drive real-world consequences through decisions, interactions, or actuations, and there is a real risk that their use can lead to harms (physical injuries, financial loss, or even death). These concerns appear ever-more prevalent, as a growing sense of distrust has led to calls for more transparency and accountability surrounding the emerging technologies that increasingly pervade our world.  A range of things can—and often do—go wrong, be they technical failure, user error, or otherwise. As such, means to effectively review, understand, and act upon the inner workings of pervasive systems is becoming increasingly important. Means for reviewing and auditing how these systems are built/developed and used are crucial to the ability to determine the cause of failures, prevent re-occurrences, and/or to identify parties at fault. Yet, despite the wider landscape of societal and legal pressures for record keeping and increased accountability, implementing such transparency measures faces a range of challenges.  This workshop will bring together a range of perspectives into how we can better audit and understand the complex, sociotechnical systems that increasingly affect us (whether directly or indirectly). From tools for data capture and retrieval, technical/ethical/legal challenges, and early ideas on concepts of relevance – we solicit submissions that help further our understanding of how pervasive systems can be built to be reviewable and auditable, helping them to be more transparent, trustworthy, and accountable.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460418.3479265;;;Systems AND Control
Repurposing Cathodic Protection Systems as Reliable, in-situ, Ambient Batteries for Sensor Networks;;;['Dhananjay Jagtap', 'Pat Pannuto'];;;May 2021;;;IPSN '21: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (co-located with CPS-IoT Week 2021);;;The majority of infrastructure is susceptible to, and therefore must constantly combat, corrosion. The monitoring and maintenance of corrosion protection (or the consequences of its unchecked failure) is often one of the leading costs of infrastructure upkeep. Galvanic cathodic protection is a common corrosion control technique that is employed in applications from home appliances to boats to bridges. At its core, however, galvanic cathodic protection is simply an electrochemical cell---that is, a battery. This presents an opportunity to treat this corrosion protection as an in-situ power source that by definition will last as long as the protection system itself. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of these pervasive, "ambient galvanic cells" as potential energy harvesting sources. We then show how to use these cells as a power source for wireless sensing devices that monitor the health of the same corrosion protection system. Our system takes advantage of newly available LPWAN technologies that allow for effortless wide-area coverage. We demonstrate the viability and efficacy of the system on one of the most common galvanic cathodic protection systems, home hot water heaters. We show that this technique can be a powerful new asset for corrosion monitoring and for deploying wireless sensor networks broadly.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412382.3458277;;;Systems AND Control
Elasecutor: Elastic Executor Scheduling in Data Analytics Systems;;;['Libin Liu', 'Hong Xu'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;Modern data analytics systems use long-running executors to run an application&#x2019;s entire DAG.

An integrated smart wheelchair model: IW Smart Wheelchair with Embedded Smart Home, Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance Systems;;;['Mohammed Ahmed Sayemaldahar', 'Sajjad Hussain Chauhdary'];;;December 2021;;;ICFNDS 2021: The 5th International Conference on Future Networks &amp; Distributed Systems;;;A smart wheelchair refers to a Powered Wheelchair (PW) with computers, sensors, and assistive technology attached. Our research is concerned with a Smart Wheelchair with sensing capability, designed to provide global accessibility. This paralyzing phenomenon affected many great individuals like Stephen Hawking and Max Brito. In this paper, wheelchair users have access to a variety of situations related to their everyday life. Our project attempts to make the lives of the people suffering from disabilities easier and simpler, helping them be more self-reliant and independent, which restores their confidence and restores their happiness. Moreover, this system is designed to make it easier for people with disabilities to move about freely without harming themselves or the environment. It helps them to control their home easily as well. It will help disabled people operate the wheelchair on their own. The technology of Android is a key to helping people interact with machines and tools in new ways. As a result, their problem can be addressed by using android technology to control the movement of a wheelchair. A wheelchair monitored and controlled by an application of android mobile is created to assist handicapped individuals by controlling the movement of a wheelchair in a different direction. The IW Smart Wheelchair model utilizes algorithms and systems that are meant to give safe navigation assistance through collision avoidance and also provides more flexibility for individuals with disabilities and for the elderly people to control the smart home. The system software's main function is to use the IW smart wheelchair model and sensors to control various devices such as doors, windows, lights, and temperature. The mobile unit and the microcontroller unit are the two main components of the system software. This paper covers our goals of the design for the IW Smart Wheelchair model and by extension the IW Smart Wheelchair, as well as the present state of the system prototype and future work plans.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508072.3508087;;;Systems AND Control
Generating metamorphic relations for cyber-physical systems with genetic programming: an industrial case study;;;['Jon Ayerdi', 'Valerio Terragni', 'Aitor Arrieta', 'Paolo Tonella', 'Goiuria Sagardui', 'Maite Arratibel'];;;August 2021;;;ESEC/FSE 2021: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering;;;One of the major challenges in the verification of complex industrial Cyber-Physical Systems is the difficulty of determining whether a particular system output or behaviour is correct or not, the so-called test oracle problem. Metamorphic testing alleviates the oracle problem by reasoning on the relations that are expected to hold among multiple executions of the system under test, which are known as Metamorphic Relations (MRs). However, the development of effective MRs is often challenging and requires the involvement of domain experts. In this paper, we present a case study aiming at automating this process. To this end, we implemented GAssertMRs, a tool to automatically generate MRs with genetic programming. We assess the cost-effectiveness of this tool in the context of an industrial case study from the elevation domain. Our experimental results show that in most cases GAssertMRs outperforms the other baselines, including manually generated MRs developed with the help of domain experts. We then describe the lessons learned from our experiments and we outline the future work for the adoption of this technique by industrial practitioners.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468264.3473920;;;Systems AND Control

AutoDim: Field-aware Embedding Dimension Searchin Recommender Systems;;;['Xiangyu Zhao', 'Haochen Liu', 'Hui Liu', 'Jiliang Tang', 'Weiwei Guo', 'Jun Shi', 'Sida Wang', 'Huiji Gao', 'Bo Long'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;Practical large-scale recommender systems usually contain thousands of feature fields from users, items, contextual information, and their interactions. Most of them empirically allocate a unified dimension to all feature fields, which is memory inefficient. Thus it is highly desired to assign various embedding dimensions to different feature fields according to their importance and predictability. Due to the large amounts of feature fields and the nuanced relationship between embedding dimensions with feature distributions and neural network architectures, manually allocating embedding dimensions in practical recommender systems can be challenging. To this end, we propose an AutoML-based framework (AutoDim) in this paper, which can automatically select dimensions for different feature fields in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we first proposed an end-to-end differentiable framework that can calculate the weights over various dimensions in a soft and continuous manner for feature fields, and an AutoML-based optimization algorithm; then, we derive a hard and discrete embedding component architecture according to the maximal weights and retrain the whole recommender framework. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of AutoDim.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450124;;;Systems AND Control
MARCO: A High-performance Task Mapping and Routing Co-optimization Framework for Point-to-Point NoC-based Heterogeneous Computing Systems;;;['Hui Chen', 'Zihao Zhang', 'Peng Chen', 'Xiangzhong Luo', 'Shiqing Li', 'Weichen Liu'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Heterogeneous computing systems (HCSs), which consist of various processing elements (PEs) that vary in their processing ability, are usually facilitated by the network-on-chip (NoC) to interconnect its components. The emerging point-to-point NoCs which support single-cycle-multi-hop transmission, reduce or eliminate the latency dependence on distance, addressing the scalability concern raised by high latency for long-distance transmission and enlarging the design space of the routing algorithm to search the non-shortest paths. For such point-to-point NoC-based HCSs, resource management strategies which are managed by compilers, scheduler, or controllers, e.g., mapping and routing, are complicated for the following reasons: (i) Due to the heterogeneity, mapping and routing need to optimize computation and communication concurrently (for homogeneous computing systems, only communication). (ii) Conducting mapping and routing consecutively cannot minimize the schedule length in most cases since the PEs with high processing ability may locate in the crowded area and suffer from high resource contention overhead. (iii) Since changing the mapping selection of one task will reconstruct the whole routing design space, the exploration of mapping and routing design space is challenging. Therefore, in this work, we propose MARCO, the mapping and routing co-optimization framework, to decrease the schedule length of applications on point-to-point NoC-based HCSs. Specifically, we revise the tabu search to explore the design space and evaluate the quality of mapping and routing. The advanced reinforcement learning (RL)algorithm, i.e., advantage actor-critic, is adopted to efficiently compute paths. We perform extensive experiments on various real applications, which demonstrates that the MARCO achieves a remarkable performance improvement in terms of schedule length (+44.94% ∼ +50.18%) when compared with the state-of-the-art mapping and routing co-optimization algorithm for homogeneous computing systems. We also compare MARCO with different combinations of state-of-the-art mapping and routing approaches.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3476985;;;Systems AND Control

By employing binding characteristics in bigraphs to constrain both the context variables of the CAAAs and the conditions that the bigraphical reactions can occur, we propose a binding bigraphical model of CAAAs in this paper to try to solve this inconsistence. The adaptation rules, therefore, can be optimized to reduce some conflicts in the modeling phase of CAAAs and in consequence some inherent faults in rule-based CAAAs can be detected and removed earlier. Taking the PhoneAdapter as an example, we compare our model with the traditional formal model called A-FSM so as to show the effectiveness of the approach presented in this paper.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3523181.3523196;;;Systems AND Control
Chaos Prediction of Power Systems by Using Deep Learning;;;['Yingdong Lu', 'Duqu Wei'];;;February 2022;;;ICMLC '22: Proceedings of the 2022 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing;;;Ensuring the stability of power systems is an important issue that should be considered in order to ensure the social and economic development of a country. Therefore, predicting the chaotic behavior of power systems in order to develop protection measures and keep power systems stable is vital. In this paper, a deep learning algorithm was proposed to predict the chaotic behavior of power systems by using deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) networks, which have two forms: deep long short-term memory with static scenario (DLSTM-s) and deep long-term memory with dynamic scenario (DLSTM-d). The genetic algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the networks. Then, taking interconnected power systems as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed DLSTM network was verified via numerical simulation. Finally, the experimental results of the DLSTM network were compared with those of the echo state network, multi-recurrent neural network, deep gated recurrent unit, and long short-term memory. Experimental results illustrated that a trained DLSTM network can predict the chaotic behavior of power systems by using the time series data of a single state variable. Moreover, the DLSTM-s network proposed in this paper can achieve competitive prediction performance compared with other baseline methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3529836.3529843;;;Systems AND Control

While previous efforts have studied fairness in recommender systems and shown success in improving fairness, they mainly focus on scenarios where unfairness arises due to biased prior user-feedback history (like clicks or views). Yet, it is unknown whether new items without any feedback history can be recommended fairly, and if unfairness does exist, how can we provide fair recommendations among these new items in such a cold-start scenario. In detail, we first formalize fairness among new items with the well-known concepts of equal opportunity and Rawlsian Max-Min fairness. We empirically show the prevalence of unfairness in cold start recommender systems. Then we propose a novel learnable post-processing framework as a model blueprint for enhancing fairness, with which we propose two concrete models: a joint-learning generative model, and a score scaling model.

We take the approach further by lifting the requirement that the baseline controller must be verified or even correct, instead also treating it as a black-box component. This change is important; there are many types of powerful control techniques---model predictive control and neural network controllers---that often work well in practice, but are unlikely to be formally proven correct due to complexity.

In particular, we introduce an online system, Tardis, for overcoming deterministic faults by using a blend of program analysis and runtime program data to systematically determine the fault-triggering input events and using domain-specific models to automatically generate transformations of the fault-triggering inputs that are both safe and semantically equivalent. We evaluated Tardison several production network control plane applications (CPAs), including six SDN CPAs and several popular BGP CPAs using 71 realistic bugs.

Finding heterogeneous-unsafe configuration parameters in cloud systems;;;['Sixiang Ma', 'Fang Zhou', 'Michael D. Bond', 'Yang Wang'];;;April 2021;;;EuroSys '21: Proceedings of the Sixteenth European Conference on Computer Systems;;;With the increasing prevalence of heterogeneous hardware and the increasing need for online reconfiguration, there is increasing demand for heterogeneous configurations. However, allowing different nodes to have different configurations may cause errors when these nodes communicate, even if the configuration of each node uses valid values. To test which configuration parameters are unsafe when configured in a heterogeneous manner, this work reuses existing unit tests but runs them with heterogeneous configurations. To address the challenge that unit tests often share the configuration across different nodes, we incorporate several heuristics to accurately map configuration objects to nodes. To address the challenge that there are too many tests to run, we (1) "pre-run" unit tests to determine effective unit tests for each configuration parameter and (2) introduce pooled testing to test several parameters together. Our evaluation finds 41 heterogeneous-unsafe configuration parameters in Flink, HBase, HDFS, MapReduce, and YARN. We further propose suggestions and workarounds to make a subset of these parameters heterogeneous safe.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456250;;;Systems AND Control
Empirical Analysis and Privacy Implications in OAuth-based Single Sign-On Systems;;;['Srivathsan G. Morkonda', 'Sonia Chiasson', 'Paul C. van Oorschot'];;;November 2021;;;WPES '21: Proceedings of the 20th Workshop on Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society;;;Single sign-on authentication systems such as OAuth 2.0 are widely used in web services. They allow users to use accounts registered with major identity providers such as Google and Facebook to login to a wide variety of independent services (relying parties). These services can both identify users and access a subset of the user's data stored with the provider. We empirically investigate the end-user privacy implications of OAuth implementations by relying parties around the world. We collect data on the use of OAuth-based logins in the Alexa Top 500 sites per country for five countries. We categorize user data made available by four identity providers (Google, Facebook, Apple, and LinkedIn) and evaluate popular services accessing user data from the SSO platforms of these providers. Many services allow users to choose from multiple login options (with different identity providers). Our results reveal that services request different categories and amounts of personal data from different providers, often with at least one choice undeniably more privacy-intrusive. We find that privacy-friendly login choices tend to be listed last, suggesting a dark pattern favoring options that release more user data. These privacy choices (and their privacy implications) are highly invisible to users. Based on our analysis, we consider challenges (e.g., opposing goals of stakeholders) in addressing these concerns and discuss ideas for further exploration.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3463676.3485600;;;Systems AND Control
Maya: using formal control to obfuscate power side channels;;;['Raghavendra Pradyumna Pothukuchi', 'Sweta Yamini Pothukuchi', 'Petros G. Voulgaris', 'Alexander Schwing', 'Josep Torrellas'];;;June 2021;;;ISCA '21: Proceedings of the 48th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture;;;The security of computers is at risk because of information leaking through their power consumption. Attackers can use advanced signal measurement and analysis to recover sensitive data from this side channel. To address this problem, this paper presents Maya, a simple and effective defense against power side channels. The idea is to use formal control to re-shape the power dissipated by a computer in an application-transparent manner---preventing attackers from learning any information about the applications that are running. With formal control, a controller can reliably keep power close to a desired target function even when runtime conditions change unpredictably. By selecting the target function intelligently, the controller can make power to follow any desired shape, appearing to carry activity information which, in reality, is unrelated to the application. Maya can be implemented in privileged software, firmware, or simple hardware. In this paper, we implement Maya on three machines using privileged threads only, and show its effectiveness and ease of deployment. Maya has already thwarted a newly-developed remote power attack.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ISCA52012.2021.00074;;;Systems AND Control
Automatically detecting and fixing concurrency bugs in go software systems;;;['Ziheng Liu', 'Shuofei Zhu', 'Boqin Qin', 'Hao Chen', 'Linhai Song'];;;April 2021;;;ASPLOS '21: Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems;;;Go is a statically typed programming language designed for efficient and reliable concurrent programming. For this purpose, Go provides lightweight goroutines and recommends passing messages using channels as a less error-prone means of thread communication. Go has become increasingly popular in recent years and has been adopted to build many important infrastructure software systems. However, a recent empirical study shows that concurrency bugs, especially those due to misuse of channels, exist widely in Go. These bugs severely hurt the reliability of Go concurrent systems. To fight Go concurrency bugs caused by misuse of channels, this paper proposes a static concurrency bug detection system, GCatch, and an automated concurrency bug fixing system, GFix. After disentangling an input Go program, GCatch models the complex channel operations in Go using a novel constraint system and applies a constraint solver to identify blocking bugs. GFix automatically patches blocking bugs detected by GCatch using Go’s channel-related language features. We apply GCatch and GFix to 21 popular Go applications, including Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC. In total, GCatch finds 149 previously unknown blocking bugs due to misuse of channels and GFix successfully fixes 124 of them. We have reported all detected bugs and generated patches to developers. So far, developers have fixed 125 blocking misuse-of-channel bugs based on our reporting. Among them, 87 bugs are fixed by applying GFix’s patches directly.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445814.3446756;;;Systems AND Control
A cache consolidation design of MLC STT-RAM for energy efficiency enhancement on cyber-physical systems;;;['Yu-Pei Liang', 'Shuo-Han Chen', 'Yuan-Hao Chang', 'Yun-Fei Liu', 'Hsin-Wen Wei', 'Wei-Kuan Shih'];;;March 2021;;;ACM SIGAPP Applied Computing Review;;;Owing to the energy-constraint nature of cyber-physical systems (CPS), energy efficiency has become a primary design consideration for CPS. On CPS, owing to the high leakage power issue of SRAM, the major portion of its energy consumption comes from static random-access memory (SRAM)-based processors. Recently, with the emerging and rapidly evolving nonvolatile Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM), STT-RAM is expected to replace SRAM within processors for enhancing the energy efficiency with its near-zero leakage power features. The advances in Magnetic Tunneling Junction (MTJ) technology also realize the multi-level cell (MLC) STT-RAM to pack more cells with the same die area for achieving the memory density. However, the write disturbance issue of MLC STT-RAM prevents STT-RAM from properly resolving the energy efficiency of CPS. Although studies have been proposed to alleviate this issue, previous strategies could induce additional management overhead due to the use of counters or lead to frequent swap operations. Such an observation motivates us to propose an effective and simple strategy to combine direct and split cache mapping designs to enhance the energy efficiency of MLC STT-RAM. A series of experiments have been conducted on an open-source emulator with encouraging results.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477133.3477136;;;Systems AND Control
Emergent design challenges for embedded systems and paths forward: mixed-criticality, energy, reliability and security perspectives;;;['Siva Satyendra Sahoo', 'Akash Kumar', 'Martin Decky', 'Samuel C.

Merrett', 'Yinyuan Zhao', 'Jiachen Wang', 'Xiaohang Wang', 'Amit Kumar Singh'];;;September 2021;;;CODES/ISSS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis;;;Modern embedded systems need to cater for several needs depending upon the application domain in which they are deployed. For example, mixed-critically needs to be considered for real-time and safety-critical systems and energy for battery-operated systems. At the same time, many of these systems demand for their reliability and security as well. With electronic systems being used for increasingly varying type of applications, novel challenges have emerged. For example, with the use of embedded systems in increasingly complex applications that execute tasks with varying priorities, mixed-criticality systems present unique challenges to designing reliable systems. The large design space involved in implementing cross-layer reliability in heterogeneous systems, particularly for mixed-critical systems, poses new research problems. Further, malicious security attacks on these systems pose additional extraordinary challenges in the system design. In this paper, we cover both the industry and academia perspectives of the challenges posed by these emergent aspects of system design towards designing high-performance, energy-efficient, reliable and/or secure embedded systems. We also provide our views on paths forward.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478684.3479246;;;Systems AND Control
Specification Guided Automated Synthesis of Feedback Controllers;;;['Nikhil Kumar Singh', 'Indranil Saha'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;The growing use of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in safety-critical applications has led to the demand for the automatic synthesis of robust feedback controllers that satisfy a given set of formal specifications. Controller synthesis from the high-level specification is an NP-Hard problem. We propose a heuristic-based automated technique that synthesizes feedback controllers guided by Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Our technique involves rigorous analysis of the traces generated by the closed-loop system, matrix decomposition, and an incremental multi-parameter tuning procedure. In case a controller cannot be found to satisfy all the specifications, we propose a technique for modifying the unsatisfiable specifications so that the controller synthesized for the satisfiable subset of specifications now also satisfies the modified specifications. We demonstrate our technique on eleven controllers used as standard closed-loop control system benchmarks, including complex controllers having multiple independent or nested control loops. Our experimental results establish that the proposed algorithm can automatically solve complex feedback controller synthesis problems within a few minutes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477011;;;Systems AND Control
Fight Fire with Fire: Towards Robust Recommender Systems via Adversarial Poisoning Training;;;['Chenwang Wu', 'Defu Lian', 'Yong Ge', 'Zhihao Zhu', 'Enhong Chen', 'Senchao Yuan'];;;July 2021;;;SIGIR '21: Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;;;Recent studies have shown that recommender systems are vulnerable, and it is easy for attackers to inject well-designed malicious profiles into the system, leading to biased recommendations. We cannot deny these data's rationality, making it imperative to establish a robust recommender system. Adversarial training has been extensively studied for robust recommendations. However, traditional adversarial training adds small perturbations to the parameters (inputs), which do not comply with the poisoning mechanism in the recommender system. Thus for the practical models that are very good at learning existing data, it does not perform well. To address the above limitations, we propose adversarial poisoning training (APT). It simulates the poisoning process by injecting fake users (ERM users) who are dedicated to minimizing empirical risk to build a robust system. Besides, to generate ERM users, we explore an approximation approach to estimate each fake user's influence on the empirical risk. Although the strategy of "fighting fire with fire" seems counterintuitive, we theoretically prove that the proposed APT can boost the upper bound of poisoning robustness. Also, we deliver the first theoretical proof that adversarial training holds a positive effect on enhancing recommendation robustness. Through extensive experiments with five poisoning attacks on four real-world datasets, the results show that the robustness improvement of APT significantly outperforms baselines. It is worth mentioning that APT also improves model generalization in most cases.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3462914;;;Systems AND Control
PHYSFRAME: type checking physical frames of reference for robotic systems;;;['Sayali Kate', 'Michael Chinn', 'Hongjun Choi', 'Xiangyu Zhang', 'Sebastian Elbaum'];;;August 2021;;;ESEC/FSE 2021: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering;;;A robotic system continuously measures its own motions and the external world during operation. Such measurements are with respect to some frame of reference, i.e., a coordinate system. A nontrivial robotic system has a large number of different frames and data have to be translated back-and-forth from a frame to another. The onus is on the developers to get such translation right. However, this is very challenging and error-prone, evidenced by the large number of questions and issues related to frame uses on developers' forum. Since any state variable can be associated with some frame, reference frames can be naturally modeled as variable types. We hence develop a novel type system that can automatically infer variables' frame types and in turn detect any type inconsistencies and violations of frame conventions. The evaluation on a set of 180 publicly available ROS projects shows that our system can detect 190 inconsistencies with 154 true positives. We reported 52 to developers and received 18 responses so far, with 15 fixed/acknowledged. Our technique also finds 45 violations of common practices.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468264.3468608;;;Systems AND Control

In the second week, students were trained to write better commit messages and worked together on a commit plan. In the final week, students worked alone on their commit plan. Commit behaviour was analysed for assignments occurring before, during and after the process. Results showed that students improved their commit behaviour in terms of number of commits, starting earlier with their assignments and writing more meaningful commit messages when compared to the rest of their cohort and the previous year's cohort (m=350). Qualitative results showed that students were mostly positive towards developing better commit behaviour and felt that the extra effort to think in commits delivered proportionally more benefits for their work.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478431.3499371;;;Systems AND Control

To alleviate this, we propose an approach in which the circuitry along with other transmission coding parameters can be dynamically tuned in response to channel SNR and beam-steering angle to either minimize power consumption or maximize throughput in the presence of manufacturing process variations while meeting a specified Bit Error Rate (BER) limit. The adaptation control policy is learned online and is facilitated by information obtained from testing of the RF circuitry before deployment.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3539845.3539981;;;Systems AND Control

The Role of Hysteresis in Caching Systems;;;['Guilherme Domingues', 'Gabriel Mendonça', 'Edmundo De Souza E Silva', 'Rosa M. M. Leão', 'Daniel S. Menasché', 'Ori Rottenstreich', 'Mostafa Dehghan', 'Don Towsley'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computing Systems;;;Caching is a fundamental element of networking systems since the early days of the Internet. By filtering requests toward custodians, caches reduce the bandwidth required by the latter and the delay experienced by clients. The requests that are not served by a cache, in turn, comprise its miss stream. We refer to the dependence of the cache state and miss stream on its history as hysteresis. Although hysteresis is at the core of caching systems, a dimension that has not been systematically studied in previous works relates to its impact on caching systems between misses, evictions, and insertions.In this article, we propose novel mechanisms and models to leverage hysteresis on cache evictions and insertions. The proposed solutions extend TTL-like mechanisms and rely on two knobs to tune the time between insertions and evictions given a target hit rate. We show the general benefits of hysteresis and the particular improvement of the two thresholds strategy in reducing download times, making the system more predictable and accounting for different costs associated with object retrieval.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450564;;;Systems AND Control

Tackling Consistency-related Design Challenges of Distributed Data-Intensive Systems: An Action Research Study;;;['Susanne Braun', 'Stefan Deßloch', 'Eberhard Wolff', 'Frank Elberzhager', 'Andreas Jedlitschka'];;;October 2021;;;ESEM '21: Proceedings of the 15th ACM / IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM);;;Background: Distributed data-intensive systems are increasingly designed to be only eventually consistent. Persistent data is no longer processed with serialized and transactional access, exposing applications to a range of potential concurrency anomalies that need to be handled by the application itself. Controlling concurrent data access in monolithic systems is already challenging, but the problem is exacerbated in distributed systems. To make it worse, only little systematic engineering guidance is provided by the software architecture community regarding this issue. Aims: In this paper, we report on our study of the effectiveness and applicability of the novel design guidelines we are proposing in this regard. Method: We used action research and conducted it in the context of the software architecture design process of a multi-site platform development project. Results: Our hypotheses regarding effectiveness and applicability have been accepted in the context of the study. The initial design guidelines were refined throughout the study. Thus, we also contribute concrete guidelines for architecting distributed data-intensive systems with eventually consistent data. The guidelines are an advancement of Domain-Driven Design and provide additional patterns for the tactical design part. Conclusions: Based on our results, we recommend using the guidelines to architect safe eventually consistent systems.

ReplayCache: Enabling Volatile Cachesfor Energy Harvesting Systems;;;['Jianping Zeng', 'Jongouk Choi', 'Xinwei Fu', 'Ajay Paddayuru Shreepathi', 'Dongyoon Lee', 'Changwoo Min', 'Changhee Jung'];;;October 2021;;;MICRO '21: MICRO-54: 54th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture;;;Energy harvesting systems have shown their unique benefit of ultra-long operation time without maintenance and are expected to be more prevalent in the era of Internet of Things. However, due to the batteryless nature, they suffer unpredictable frequent power outages. They thus require a lightweight mechanism for crash consistency since saving/restoring checkpoints across the outages can limit forward progress by consuming hard-won energy. For the reason, energy harvesting systems have been designed with a non-volatile memory (NVM) only. The use of a volatile data cache has been assumed to be not viable or at least challenging due to the difficulty to ensure cacheline persistence.  In this paper, we propose ReplayCache, a software-only crash consistency scheme that enables commodity energy harvesting systems to exploit a volatile data cache. ReplayCache does not have to ensure the persistence of dirty cachelines or record their logs at run time. Instead, ReplayCache recovery runtime re-executes the potentially unpersisted stores in the wake of power failure to restore the consistent NVM state, from which interrupted program can safely resume. To support store replay during recovery, ReplayCache partitions program into a series of regions in a way that store operand registers remain intact within each region, and checkpoints all registers just before power failure using the crash consistency mechanism of the commodity systems. For performance, ReplayCache enables region-level persistence that allows the stores in a region to be asynchronously persisted until the region ends, exploiting ILP. The evaluation with 23 benchmark applications show that compared to the baseline with no caches, ReplayCache can achieve about 10.72x and 8.5x-8.9x speedup (on geometric mean) for the scenarios without and with power outages, respectively.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466752.3480102;;;Systems AND Control
Improving the Information Disclosure in Mobility-on-Demand Systems;;;['Yue Yang', 'Yuan Shi', 'Dejian Wang', 'Qisheng Chen', 'Lei Xu', 'Hanqian Li', 'Zhouyu Fu', 'Xin Li', 'Hao Zhang'];;;August 2021;;;KDD '21: Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining;;;Nowadays, the ubiquity of sharing economy and the booming of ride-sharing services prompt Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) platforms to explore and develop new business modes. Different from forcing full-time drivers to serve the dispatched orders, these modes usually aim to attract part-time drivers to share their vehicles and employ a 'driver-choose-order' pattern by displaying a sequence of orders to drivers as a candidate set. A key issue here is to determine which orders should be displayed to each driver. In this work, we propose a novel framework to tackle this issue, known as the Information Disclosure problem in MoD systems. The problem is solved in two steps combining estimation with optimization: 1) in the estimation step, we investigate the drivers' choice behavior and estimate the probability of choosing an order or ignoring the displayed candidate set. 2) in the optimization step, we transform the problem into determining the optimal edge configuration in a bipartite graph, then we develop a Minimal-Loss Edge Cutting (MLEC) algorithm to solve it. Through extensive experiments on both the simulation and the real-world data from Huolala business, the proposed method remarkably improves users experience and platform efficiency. Based on these promising results, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed in the real-world MoD system in Huolala.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447548.3467062;;;Systems AND Control

Many RNN-driven dialogue systems, such as Siri, Google Home, and Alexa, have been deployed to assist various tasks. However, accompanying this outstanding performance, RNN-driven dialogue systems, which are essentially a kind of software, could also produce erroneous behaviors and result in massive losses. Meanwhile, the complexity and intractability of RNN models that power the dialogue systems make their testing challenging. In this paper, we design and implement DialTest, the first RNN-driven dialogue system testing tool. DialTest employs a series of transformation operators to make realistic changes on seed data while preserving their oracle information properly. To improve the efficiency of detecting faults, DialTest further adopts Gini impurity to guide the test generation process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate DialTest. We first experiment it on two fundamental tasks, i.e., intent detection and slot filling, of natural language understanding. The experiment results show that DialTest can effectively detect hundreds of erroneous behaviors for different RNN-driven natural language understanding (NLU) modules of dialogue systems and improve their accuracy via retraining with the generated data. Further, we conduct a case study on an industrial dialogue system to investigate the performance of DialTest under the real usage scenario. The study shows DialTest can detect errors and improve the robustness of RNN-driven dialogue systems effectively.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460319.3464829;;;Systems AND Control

The digital monitoring system under study generates data that can be applied in monitoring of production efficiency, production quality, productive resources expenditures, technical diagnostics of equipment, capacity reserves and redirection of investments as a result of production optimization. The study also offers a qualitative description of benefits achieved with the implementation of a digital monitoring system in an industrial enterprise. Moreover, the study provides a quantitative estimate of implementation efficiency of a digital monitoring system in an industrial enterprise on the example of a large Russian metallurgical enterprise that saw increased production load and overall revenue after the implementation of a digital monitoring system. The study results can be applied in practice in industrial enterprises as a step towards the creation of an enterprise`s single information environment. Further research can be made in direction of accumulation and analysis of implementation cases of a digital monitoring system by industry.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3527049.3527120;;;Systems AND Control
A Hybrid Siamese Neural Network for Natural Language Inference in Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Pin Ni', 'Yuming Li', 'Gangmin Li', 'Victor Chang'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Internet Technology;;;Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), as a multi-dimensional complex system that connects the physical world and the cyber world, has a strong demand for processing large amounts of heterogeneous data. These tasks also include Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks based on text from different sources. However, the current research on natural language processing in CPS does not involve exploration in this field. Therefore, this study proposes a Siamese Network structure that combines Stacked Residual Long Short-Term Memory (bidirectional) with the Attention mechanism and Capsule Network for the NLI module in CPS, which is used to infer the relationship between text/language data from different sources. This model is mainly used to implement NLI tasks and conduct a detailed evaluation in three main NLI benchmarks as the basic semantic understanding module in CPS. Comparative experiments prove that the proposed method achieves competitive performance, has a certain generalization ability, and can balance the performance and the number of trained parameters.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3418208;;;Systems AND Control
The Simpson’s Paradox in the Offline Evaluation of Recommendation Systems;;;['Amir H. Jadidinejad', 'Craig Macdonald', 'Iadh Ounis'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Information Systems;;;Recommendation systems are often evaluated based on user’s interactions that were collected from an existing, already deployed recommendation system. In this situation, users only provide feedback on the exposed items and they may not leave feedback on other items since they have not been exposed to them by the deployed system. As a result, the collected feedback dataset that is used to evaluate a new model is influenced by the deployed system, as a form of closed loop feedback. In this article, we show that the typical offline evaluation of recommender systems suffers from the so-called Simpson’s paradox. Simpson’s paradox is the name given to a phenomenon observed when a significant trend appears in several different sub-populations of observational data but disappears or is even reversed when these sub-populations are combined together. Our in-depth experiments based on stratified sampling reveal that a very small minority of items that are frequently exposed by the deployed system plays a confounding factor in the offline evaluation of recommendation systems. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation methodology that takes into account the confounder, i.e., the deployed system’s characteristics. Using the relative comparison of many recommendation models as in the typical offline evaluation of recommender systems, and based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, we show that our proposed evaluation methodology exhibits statistically significant improvements of 14% and 40% on the examined open loop datasets (Yahoo! and Coat), respectively, in reflecting the true ranking of systems with an open loop (randomised) evaluation in comparison to the standard evaluation.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458509;;;Systems AND Control
V2C: A Trust-Based Vehicle to Cloud Anomaly Detection Framework for Automotive Systems;;;['Thomas Rosenstatter', 'Tomas Olovsson', 'Magnus Almgren'];;;August 2021;;;ARES '21: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security;;;Vehicles have become connected in many ways. They communicate with the cloud and will use Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to exchange warning messages and perform cooperative actions such as platooning. Vehicles have already been attacked and will become even more attractive targets due to their increasing connectivity, the amount of data they produce and their importance to our society. It is therefore crucial to provide cyber security measures to prevent and limit the impact of attacks.  As it is problematic for a vehicle to reliably assess its own state when it is compromised, we investigate how vehicle trust can be used to identify compromised vehicles and how fleet-wide attacks can be detected at an early stage using cloud data. In our proposed V2C Anomaly Detection framework, peer vehicles assess each other based on their perceived behavior in traffic and V2X-enabled interactions, and upload these assessments to the cloud for analysis. This framework consists of four modules. For each module we define functional demands, interfaces and evaluate solutions proposed in literature allowing manufacturers and fleet owners to choose appropriate techniques. We detail attack scenarios where this type of framework is particularly useful in detecting and identifying potential attacks and failing software and hardware. Furthermore, we describe what basic vehicle data the cloud analysis can be based upon.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465481.3465750;;;Systems AND Control
Design Space Exploration for Secure IoT Devices and Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Lukas Gressl', 'Christian Steger', 'Ulrich Neffe'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), embedded devices have been gaining importance in our daily lives, as well as industrial processes. Independent of their usage, be it within an IoT system or a CPS, embedded devices are always an attractive target for security attacks, mainly due to their continuous network availability and the importance of the data they handle. Thus, the design of such systems requires a thorough consideration of the various security constraints they are liable to. Introducing these security constraints, next to other requirements, such as power consumption, and performance increases the number of design choices a system designer must consider. As the various constraints are often conflicting with each other, designers face the complex task of balancing them. System designers facilitate Design Space Exploration (DSE) tools to support a system designer in this job. However, available DSE tools only offer a limited way of considering security constraints during the design process. In this article, we introduce a novel DSE framework, which allows the consideration of security constraints, in the form of attack scenarios, and attack mitigations in the form of security tasks. Based on the descriptions of the system’s functionality and architecture, possible attacks, and known mitigation techniques, the framework finds the optimal design for a secure IoT device or CPS. Our framework’s functionality and its benefits are shown based on the design of a secure sensor system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3430372;;;Systems AND Control
Consensus in Blockchain Systems with Low Network Throughput: A Systematic Mapping Study;;;['Henrik Knudsen', 'Jakob Svennevik Notland', 'Peter Halland Haro', 'Truls Bakkejord Raeder', 'Jingyue Li'];;;July 2021;;;BIOTC '21: Proceedings of the 2021 3rd Blockchain and Internet of Things Conference;;;Blockchain technologies originate from cryptocurrencies. Thus, most blockchain technologies assume an environment with a fast and stable network. However, in some blockchain-based systems, e.g., supply chain management (SCM) systems, some Internet of Things (IoT) nodes can only rely on the low-quality network sometimes to achieve consensus. Thus, it is critical to understand the applicability of existing consensus algorithms in such environments. We performed a systematic mapping study to evaluate and compare existing consensus mechanisms’ capability to provide integrity and security with varying network properties. Our study identified 25 state-of-the-art consensus algorithms from published and preprint literature. We categorized and compared the consensus algorithms qualitatively based on established performance and integrity metrics and well-known blockchain security issues. Results show that consensus algorithms that rely on synchronous network for correctness cannot provide the expected integrity. Such consensus algorithms may also be vulnerable to distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) and routing attacks, given limited network throughput. Conversely, asynchronous consensus algorithms, e.g., Honey-BadgerBFT, are deemed more robust against many of these attacks and may provide high integrity in asynchronous events.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3475992.3475995;;;Systems AND Control
Automatic Intent-Slot Induction for Dialogue Systems;;;['Zengfeng Zeng', 'Dan Ma', 'Haiqin Yang', 'Zhen Gou', 'Jianping Shen'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;Automatically and accurately identifying user intents and filling the associated slots from their spoken language are critical to the success of dialogue systems. Traditional methods require manually defining the DOMAIN-INTENT-SLOT schema and asking many domain experts to annotate the corresponding utterances, upon which neural models are trained. This procedure brings the challenges of information sharing hindering, out-of-schema, or data sparsity in open domain dialogue systems. To tackle these challenges, we explore a new task of automatic intent-slot induction and propose a novel domain-independent tool. That is, we design a coarse-to-fine three-step procedure including Role-labeling, Concept-mining, And Pattern-mining (RCAP): (1) role-labeling: extracting key phrases from users’ utterances and classifying them into a quadruple of coarsely-defined intent-roles via sequence labeling; (2) concept-mining: clustering the extracted intent-role mentions and naming them into abstract fine-grained concepts; (3) pattern-mining: applying the Apriori algorithm to mine intent-role patterns and automatically inferring the intent-slot using these coarse-grained intent-role labels and fine-grained concepts. Empirical evaluations on both real-world in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that: (1) our RCAP can generate satisfactory SLU schema and outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised learning method; (2) our RCAP can be directly applied to out-of-domain datasets and gain at least 76% improvement of F1-score on intent detection and 41% improvement of F1-score on slot filling; (3) our RCAP exhibits its power in generic intent-slot extractions with less manual effort, which opens pathways for schema induction on new domains and unseen intent-slot discovery for generalizable dialogue systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450026;;;Systems AND Control
LensCap: split-process framework for fine-grained visual privacy control for augmented reality apps;;;['Jinhan Hu', 'Andrei Iosifescu', 'Robert LiKamWa'];;;June 2021;;;MobiSys '21: Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services;;;Augmented Reality (AR) enables smartphone users to interact with virtual content spatially overlaid on a continuously captured physical world. Under the current permission enforcement model in popular operating systems, AR apps are given Internet permission at installation time, and request camera permission and external storage write permission at runtime through a user's approval. With these permissions granted, any Internet-enabled AR app could silently collect camera frames and derived visual information for malicious intent without a user's awareness. This raises serious concerns about the disclosure of private user data in their living environments. To give users more control over application usage of their camera frames and the information derived from them, we introduce LensCap, a split-process app design framework, in which the app is split into a camera-handling visual process and a connectivity-handling network process. At runtime, LensCap manages secured communications between split processes, enacting fine-grained data usage monitoring. LensCap also allows both processes to present interactive user interfaces. With LensCap, users can decide what forms of visual data can be transmitted to the network, while still allowing visual data to be used for AR purposes on device. We prototype LensCap as an Android library and demonstrate its usability as a plugin in Unreal Engine. Performance evaluation results on five AR apps confirm that visual privacy can be preserved with an insignificant latency penalty (< 1.3 ms) at 60 FPS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458864.3467676;;;Systems AND Control
On the instability of embeddings for recommender systems: the case of matrix factorization;;;['Giovanni Gabbolini', "Edoardo D'Amico", 'Cesare Bernardis', 'Paolo Cremonesi'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;Most state-of-the-art top-N collaborative recommender systems work by learning embeddings to jointly represent users and items. Learned embeddings are considered to be effective to solve a variety of tasks. Among others, providing and explaining recommendations. In this paper we question the reliability of the embeddings learned by Matrix Factorization (MF). We empirically demonstrate that, by simply changing the initial values assigned to the latent factors, the same MF method generates very different embeddings of items and users, and we highlight that this effect is stronger for less popular items. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a generalization of MF, called Nearest Neighbors Matrix Factorization (NNMF). The new method propagates the information about items and users to their neighbors, speeding up the training procedure and extending the amount of information that supports recommendations and representations. We describe the NNMF variants of three common MF approaches, and with extensive experiments on five different datasets we show that they strongly mitigate the instability issues of the original MF versions and they improve the accuracy of recommendations on the long-tail.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3442011;;;Systems AND Control
Evaluating Mixed-initiative Conversational Search Systems via User Simulation;;;['Ivan Sekulić', 'Mohammad Aliannejadi', 'Fabio Crestani'];;;February 2022;;;WSDM '22: Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining;;;Clarifying the underlying user information need by asking clarifying questions is an important feature of modern conversational search system. However, evaluation of such systems through answering prompted clarifying questions requires significant human effort, which can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a conversational User Simulator, called USi, for automatic evaluation of such conversational search systems. Given a description of an information need, USi is capable of automatically answering clarifying questions about the topic throughout the search session. Through a set of experiments, including automated natural language generation metrics and crowdsourcing studies, we show that responses generated by USi are both inline with the underlying information need and comparable to human-generated answers. Moreover, we make the first steps towards multi-turn interactions, where conversational search systems asks multiple questions to the (simulated) user with a goal of clarifying the user need. To this end, we expand on currently available datasets for studying clarifying questions, i.e., Qulac and ClariQ, by performing a crowdsourcing-based multi-turn data acquisition. We show that our generative, GPT2-based model, is capable of providing accurate and natural answers to unseen clarifying questions in the single-turn setting and discuss capabilities of our model in the multi-turn setting. We provide the code, data, and the pre-trained model to be used for further research on the topic.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488560.3498440;;;Systems AND Control

Hazard analysis for human-on-the-loop interactions in sUAS systems;;;['Michael Vierhauser', 'Md Nafee Al Islam', 'Ankit Agrawal', 'Jane Cleland-Huang', 'James Mason'];;;August 2021;;;ESEC/FSE 2021: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering;;;With the rise of new AI technologies, autonomous systems are moving towards a paradigm in which increasing levels of responsibility are shifted from the human to the system, creating a transition from human-in-the-loop systems to human-on-the-loop (HoTL) systems. This has a significant impact on the safety analysis of such systems, as new types of errors occurring at the boundaries of human-machine interactions need to be taken into consideration. Traditional safety analysis typically focuses on system-level hazards with little focus on user-related or user-induced hazards that can cause critical system failures. To address this issue, we construct domain-level safety analysis assets for sUAS (small unmanned aerial systems) applications and describe the process we followed to explicitly, and systematically identify Human Interaction Points (HiPs), Hazard Factors and Mitigations from system hazards. We evaluate our approach by first investigating the extent to which recent sUAS incidents are covered by our hazard trees, and second by performing a study with six domain experts using our hazard trees to identify and document hazards for sUAS usage scenarios. Our study showed that our hazard trees provided effective coverage for a wide variety of sUAS application scenarios and were useful for stimulating safety thinking and helping users to identify and potentially mitigate human-interaction hazards.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468264.3468534;;;Systems AND Control

Radiant: efficient page table management for tiered memory systems;;;['Sandeep Kumar', 'Aravinda Prasad', 'Smruti R. Sarangi', 'Sreenivas Subramoney'];;;June 2021;;;ISMM 2021: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management;;;Modern enterprise servers are increasingly embracing tiered memory systems with a combination of low latency DRAMs and large capacity but high latency non-volatile main memories (NVMMs) such as Intel’s Optane DC PMM. Prior works have focused on the efficient placement and migration of data on a tiered memory system, but have not studied the optimal placement of page tables.   Explicit and efficient placement of page tables is crucial for large memory footprint applications with high TLB miss rates because they incur dramatically higher page walk latency when page table pages are placed in NVMM. We show that (i) page table pages can end up on NVMM even when enough DRAM memory is available and (ii) page table pages that spill over to NVMM due to DRAM memory pressure are not migrated back later when memory is available in DRAM.   We study the performance impact of page table placement in a tiered memory system and propose Radiant, an efficient and transparent page table management technique that (i) applies different placement policies for data and page table pages,(ii) introduces a differentiating policy for page table pages by placing a small but critical part of the page table in DRAM, and (iii) dynamically and judiciously manages the rest of the page table by transparently migrating the page table pages between DRAM and NVMM. Our implementation on a real system equipped with Intel’s Optane NVMM running Linux reduces the page table walk cycles by 12% and total cycles by 20% on an average. This improves the runtime by 20% on an average for a set of synthetic and real-world large memory footprint applications when compared with various default Linux kernel techniques.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459898.3463907;;;Systems AND Control

A live environment for inspection and refactoring of software systems;;;['Sara Fernandes'];;;August 2021;;;ESEC/FSE 2021: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering;;;Refactoring helps to improve the design of software systems, making them more readable, maintainable, cleaner, and easy to expand. Most of the tools that already exist on this concept allow developers to select and execute the best refactoring techniques for a particular programming context. However, they aren’t interactive and prompt enough, providing a poor programming experience. In this gap, we can introduce and combine the topic of liveness with refactoring methods. Live Refactoring allows to know continuously, while programming, the blocks of code that we should refactor and why they were classified as problematic. Therefore, it shortens the time needed to create high-quality systems, due to early and continuous refactoring feedback, support, and guidance. This paper presents our research project based on a live refactoring environment.

Learning an Adaptive Meta Model-Generator for Incrementally Updating Recommender Systems;;;['Danni Peng', 'Sinno Jialin Pan', 'Jie Zhang', 'Anxiang Zeng'];;;September 2021;;;RecSys '21: Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems;;;Recommender Systems (RSs) in real-world applications often deal with billions of user interactions daily. To capture the most recent trends effectively, it is common to update the model incrementally using only the newly arrived data. However, this may impede the model’s ability to retain long-term information due to the potential overfitting and forgetting issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel Adaptive Sequential Model Generation (ASMG) framework, which generates a better serving model from a sequence of historical models via a meta generator. For the design of the meta generator, we propose to employ Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to leverage its ability to capture the long-term dependencies. We further introduce some novel strategies to apply together with the GRU meta generator, which not only improve its computational efficiency but also enable more accurate sequential modeling. By instantiating the model-agnostic framework on a general deep learning-based RS model, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and one industrial dataset.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460231.3474239;;;Systems AND Control

Predictive Monitoring with Logic-Calibrated Uncertainty for Cyber-Physical Systems;;;['Meiyi Ma', 'John Stankovic', 'Ezio Bartocci', 'Lu Feng'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Predictive monitoring—making predictions about future states and monitoring if the predicted states satisfy requirements—offers a promising paradigm in supporting the decision making of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Existing works of predictive monitoring mostly focus on monitoring individual predictions rather than sequential predictions. We develop a novel approach for monitoring sequential predictions generated from Bayesian Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can capture the inherent uncertainty in CPS, drawing on insights from our study of real-world CPS datasets. We propose a new logic named Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty (STL-U) to monitor a flowpipe containing an infinite set of uncertain sequences predicted by Bayesian RNNs. We define STL-U strong and weak satisfaction semantics based on whether all or some sequences contained in a flowpipe satisfy the requirement. We also develop methods to compute the range of confidence levels under which a flowpipe is guaranteed to strongly (weakly) satisfy an STL-U formula. Furthermore, we develop novel criteria that leverage STL-U monitoring results to calibrate the uncertainty estimation in Bayesian RNNs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach via experiments with real-world CPS datasets and a simulated smart city case study, which show very encouraging results of STL-U based predictive monitoring approach outperforming baselines.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477032;;;Systems AND Control
Adaptation: adapting specification learners in assured adaptive systems;;;['Dalal Alrajeh', 'Patrick Benjamin', 'Sebastian Uchitel'];;;November 2021;;;ASE '21: Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering;;;Specification learning and controller synthesis are two methods that promise to provide control systems with assured adaptive capabilities at run-time. Specification learning can automatically update specifications in light of violation traces observed within the operational environment. Controller synthesis can then automatically generate implementations that are guaranteed to satisfy these specifications in every environment. Specification learning is implemented using general-purpose AI systems. These systems are highly configurable, and the configuration choice heavily affects the effectiveness. Setting configuration parameters is far from obvious as they bear no clear semantic relation with the adaptation task. State of the art requires configurations to be set by domain experts at design time for each application domain. In this paper, we argue that to create assured control systems that can effectively and efficiently adapt at run-time, the learning systems upon which they are built must also have adaptive learning strategies for determining configurations at runtime. We demonstrate this idea with a proof-of-concept that computes domain-dependent policies using reinforcement learning.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678919;;;Systems AND Control
How Am I Doing?: Evaluating Conversational Search Systems Offline;;;['Aldo Lipani', 'Ben Carterette', 'Emine Yilmaz'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Information Systems;;;As conversational agents like Siri and Alexa gain in popularity and use, conversation is becoming a more and more important mode of interaction for search. Conversational search shares some features with traditional search, but differs in some important respects: conversational search systems are less likely to return ranked lists of results (a SERP), more likely to involve iterated interactions, and more likely to feature longer, well-formed user queries in the form of natural language questions. Because of these differences, traditional methods for search evaluation (such as the Cranfield paradigm) do not translate easily to conversational search. In this work, we propose a framework for offline evaluation of conversational search, which includes a methodology for creating test collections with relevance judgments, an evaluation measure based on a user interaction model, and an approach to collecting user interaction data to train the model. The framework is based on the idea of “subtopics”, often used to model novelty and diversity in search and recommendation, and the user model is similar to the geometric browsing model introduced by RBP and used in ERR. As far as we know, this is the first work to combine these ideas into a comprehensive framework for offline evaluation of conversational search.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3451160;;;Systems AND Control
A Heterogeneous MPI+PPL Task Scheduling Approach for Asynchronous Many-Task Runtime Systems;;;['John Holmen', 'Damodar Sahasrabudhe', 'Martin Berzins'];;;July 2021;;;PEARC '21: Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing;;;Asynchronous many-task runtime systems and MPI+X hybrid parallelism approaches have shown promise for helping manage the increasing complexity of nodes in current and emerging high performance computing (HPC) systems, including those for exascale. The increasing architectural diversity of these systems, however, poses challenges for runtimes supporting more homogeneous HPC systems. Performance portability layers (PPL) have shown promise for helping manage this diversity. This paper describes a heterogeneous MPI+PPL task scheduling approach for combining these promising solutions with additional consideration for parallel third party libraries facing similar challenges to help prepare such a runtime for the diverse heterogeneous systems accompanying exascale computing. This approach is demonstrated using a heterogeneous MPI+Kokkos task scheduler and the accompanying portable abstractions [16] implemented in the Uintah Computational Framework, an asynchronous many-task runtime system, with additional consideration for hypre, a parallel third party library. Results are shown for two challenging problems executing workloads representative of typical Uintah applications. These results show performance improvements up to 4.4x when using this scheduler and the accompanying portable abstractions [16] to port a previously MPI-Only problem to Kokkos::OpenMP and Kokkos::CUDA to improve complex heterogeneous node use. Good strong-scaling to 1,024 NVIDIA V100 GPUs and 512 IBM POWER9 processor are also shown using MPI+Kokkos::OpenMP+Kokkos::CUDA at scale.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437359.3465581;;;Systems AND Control

Brillouin light scattering has been exploited to study the frequency dependence of thermally excited magnetic eigenmodes on the intensity of the external magnetic field, applied along the easy axis of the elements.Scientific information technology has been developed rapidly. Here, the purposes are to make people's lives more convenient and ensure information management and classification. The machine learning algorithm is improved to obtain the optimized Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm. Then, an Android-based intelligent support information management system is designed based on LightGBM for the big data analysis and classification management of information in the intelligent support information management system. The system is designed with modules of employee registration and login, company announcement notice, attendance and attendance management, self-service, and daily tools with the company as the subject. Furthermore, the performance of the constructed information management system is analyzed through simulations. Results demonstrate that the training time of the optimized LightGBM algorithm can stabilize at about 100s, and the test time can stabilize at 0.68s. Besides, its accuracy rate can reach 89.24%, which is at least 3.6% higher than other machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the acceleration efficiency analysis of each algorithm suggests that the optimized LightGBM algorithm is suitable for processing large amounts of data; its acceleration effect is more apparent, and its acceleration ratio is higher than other algorithms.

Prediction Model of Commitment of New Self-Employed Omanis to Insurance Systems.;;;['Khalfan Ali AlKindi', 'Ferddie Quiroz Canlas'];;;April 2021;;;DATA'21: International Conference on Data Science, E-learning and Information Systems 2021;;;The Omanis self-employed insurance system is one of the four insurance systems for private-sector employees that the Public Authority for Social Insurance (PASI) supervises. The system suffers from some problems related to the contributors' payment commitment. The reason is that some factors affect their commitment after joining the system. The payment defaulting presents a challenge for PASI as it becomes an obstacle to realizing the benefits. The study aims to identify the most critical factors that affect contributors’ commitment to this system. The data mining and machine learning methods are used, such as Logistic Regression Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, and Multilayers Perceptron Classifier, to identify these factors and classify committed contributors. A sample was obtained from 11773 contributors registered in PASI data with 24 features. This data has also been reprocessed to get rid of noisy and irrelevant data. The study concluded that the most critical factors that affect contributors' commitment to this system are personal factors, commercial factors, and economic factors. Besides, the results of the recommended model were 0.94, which is the Logistic Regression Classifier. The study recommended using machine learning as the primary approach in the social insurance field in Oman. It is more accurate and efficient than traditional statistical methods to help decision-makers on scientific foundations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460620.3460756;;;Systems AND Control
Reliable and Secure Data Sharing in Decentralized Mobile Crowd Systems;;;['Zhenni Feng', 'Junchang Chen', 'Fanbo Xu'];;;July 2021;;;ACM TURC '21: Proceedings of the ACM Turing Award Celebration Conference - China;;;Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems, which offer a great opportunity to fully take advantage of wisdom of the crowd, naturally benefits from low deployment cost and widely spatial coverage. Due to failure or risk caused by a central server, we study the problem of constructing an efficient mobile crowd sensing system with untrustworthy participants in a decentralized manner. We propose an efficient and practical decentralized MCS system based on a distributed auction process and the blockchain system. The proposed method achieves the optimal social profit iteratively satisfying individual rationality and protecting their privacy, through a neutral, public and trustful platform.

MB2: Decomposed Behavior Modeling for Self-Driving Database Management Systems;;;['Lin Ma', 'William Zhang', 'Jie Jiao', 'Wuwen Wang', 'Matthew Butrovich', 'Wan Shen Lim', 'Prashanth Menon', 'Andrew Pavlo'];;;June 2021;;;SIGMOD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data;;;Database management systems (DBMSs) are notoriously difficult to deploy and administer. The goal of a self-driving DBMS is to remove these impediments by managing itself automatically. However, a critical problem in achieving full autonomy is how to predict the DBMS's runtime behavior and resource consumption. These predictions guide a self-driving DBMS's decision-making components to tune and optimize all aspects of the system. We present the ModelBot2 end-to-end framework for constructing and maintaining prediction models using machine learning (ML) in self-driving DBMSs. Our approach decomposes a DBMS's architecture into fine-grained operating units that make it easier to estimate the system's behavior for configurations that it has never seen before. ModelBot2 then provides an offline execution environment to exercise the system to produce the training data used to train its models. We integrated ModelBot2 in an in-memory DBMS and measured its ability to predict its performance for OLTP and OLAP workloads running in dynamic environments. We also compare ModelBot2 against state-of-the-art ML models and show that our models are up to 25x more accurate in multiple scenarios.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3457276;;;Systems AND Control
LaserShark: Establishing Fast, Bidirectional Communication into Air-Gapped Systems;;;['Niclas Kühnapfel', 'Stefan Preußler', 'Maximilian Noppel', 'Thomas Schneider', 'Konrad Rieck', 'Christian Wressnegger'];;;December 2021;;;ACSAC '21: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference;;;Physical isolation, so called air-gapping, is an effective method for protecting security-critical computers and networks. While it might be possible to introduce malicious code through the supply chain, insider attacks, or social engineering, communicating with the outside world is prevented. Different approaches to breach this essential line of defense have been developed based on electromagnetic, acoustic, and optical communication channels. However, all of these approaches are limited in either data rate or distance, and frequently offer only exfiltration of data. We present a novel approach to infiltrate data to air-gapped systems without any additional hardware on-site. By aiming lasers at already built-in LEDs and recording their response, we are the first to enable a long-distance (25 m), bidirectional, and fast (18.2 kbps in & 100 kbps out) covert communication channel. The approach can be used against any office device that operates LEDs at the CPU’s GPIO interface.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485832.3485911;;;Systems AND Control

This is surprising since HEP data analysis matches the SQL model well: the data is fully structured and queried using mostly standard operators. To gain insights on why this is the case, we perform a comprehensive analysis of six diverse, general-purpose data processing platforms using an HEP benchmark. The result of the evaluation is an interesting and rather complex picture of existing solutions: Their query languages vary greatly in how natural and concise HEP query patterns can be expressed. Furthermore, most of them are also between one and two orders of magnitude slower than the domain-specific system used by particle physicists today. These observations suggest that, while database systems and their query languages are in principle viable tools for HEP, significant work remains to make them relevant to HEP researchers.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3489496.3489498;;;Systems AND Control

In this paper, we present a comprehensive definition and analysis of watermarks, a key tool for reasoning about temporal completeness in infinite streams.First, we describe what watermarks are and why they are important, highlighting how they address a suite of stream processing needs that are poorly served by eventually-consistent approaches:• Computing a single correct answer, as in notifications.• Reasoning about a lack of data, as in dip detection.• Performing non-incremental processing over temporal subsets of an infinite stream, as in statistical anomaly detection with cubic spline models.• Safely and punctually garbage collecting obsolete inputs and intermediate state.• Surfacing a reliable signal of overall pipeline health.Second, we describe, evaluate, and compare the semantically equivalent, but starkly different, watermark implementations in two modern stream processing engines: Apache Flink and Google Cloud Dataflow.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3476311.3476389;;;Systems AND Control
Understanding and improving model-driven IoT systems through accompanying digital twins;;;['Jörg Christian Kirchhof', 'Lukas Malcher', 'Bernhard Rumpe'];;;October 2021;;;GPCE 2021: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences;;;Developers questioning why their system behaves differently than expected often have to rely on time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis of log files. Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system’s executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system’s environment based on the data recorded by the system’s digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study. By facilitating the reproduction of the system’s behavior, our method lowers the barrier to understanding the behavior of model-driven IoT systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486609.3487210;;;Systems AND Control
Malicious Node Identification in Coded Distributed Storage Systems under Pollution Attacks;;;['Rossano Gaeta', 'Marco Grangetto'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computing Systems;;;In coding-based distributed storage systems (DSSs), a set of storage nodes (SNs) hold coded fragments of a data unit that collectively allow one to recover the original information. It is well known that data modification (a.k.a. pollution attack) is the Achilles’ heel of such coding systems; indeed, intentional modification of a single coded fragment has the potential to prevent the reconstruction of the original information because of error propagation induced by the decoding algorithm. The challenge we take in this work is to devise an algorithm to identify polluted coded fragments within the set encoding a data unit and to characterize its performance.To this end, we provide the following contributions: (i) We devise MIND (Malicious node IdeNtification in DSS), an algorithm that is general with respect to the encoding mechanism chosen for the DSS, it is able to cope with a heterogeneous allocation of coded fragments to SNs, and it is effective in successfully identifying polluted coded fragments in a low-redundancy scenario; (ii) We formally prove both MIND termination and correctness; (iii) We derive an accurate analytical characterization of MIND performance (hit probability and complexity); (iv) We develop a C++ prototype that implements MIND to validate the performance predictions of the analytical model.Finally, to show applicability of our work, we define performance and robustness metrics for an allocation of coded fragments to SNs and we apply the results of the analytical characterization of MIND performance to select coded fragments allocations yielding robustness to collusion as well as the highest probability to identify actual attackers.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491062;;;Systems AND Control
Runtime energy minimization of distributed many-core systems using transfer learning;;;['Dainius Jenkus', 'Fei Xia', 'Rishad Shafik', 'Alex Yakovlev'];;;March 2022;;;DATE '22: Proceedings of the 2022 Conference &amp; Exhibition on Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe;;;The heterogeneity of computing resources continues to permeate into many-core systems making energy-efficiency a challenging objective. Existing rule-based and model-driven methods return sub-optimal energy-efficiency and limited scalability as system complexity increases to the domain of distributed systems. This is exacerbated further by dynamic variations of workloads and quality-of-service (QoS) demands. This work presents a QoS-aware runtime management method for energy minimization using a transfer learning (TL) driven exploration strategy. It enhances standard Q-learning to improve both learning speed and operational optimality (i.e., QoS and energy). The core to our approach is a multi-dimensional knowledge transfer across a task's state-action space. It accelerates the learning of dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) control actions for tuning power/performance trade-offs. Firstly, the method identifies and transfers already learned policies between explored and behaviorally similar states referred to as Intra-Task Learning Transfer (ITLT). Secondly, if no similar "expert" states are available, it accelerates exploration at a local state's level through what's known as Intra-State Learning Transfer (ISLT). A comparative evaluation of the approach indicates faster and more balanced exploration. This is shown through energy savings ranging from 7.30% to 18.06%, and improved QoS from 10.43% to 14.3%, when compared to existing exploration strategies. This method is demonstrated under WordPress and TensorFlow workloads on a server cluster.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3539845.3540133;;;Systems AND Control

Our recommender system is an assistant to the sales team, helping recommend relevant apps to the customers for their businesses and increasing the likelihood of improving sales revenue. Besides recommendation accuracy, recommendation diversity and explainability are even more crucial since they provide more exposure opportunities for app developers and improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the recommender system. To allow the sales team to explore unpopular but relevant apps and understand why such apps are recommended, we propose a novel framework for improving aggregate recommendation diversity and generating recommendation explanations, which supports a wide variety of models for improving recommendation accuracy. The model in our framework is simple yet effective, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner and deployed as a recommendation service easily. Furthermore, our framework can also apply to other generic recommender systems for improving diversity and generating explanations.

A real-time experimentation platform for sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave MIMO systems;;;['Jesus O. Lacruz', 'Rafael Ruiz Ortiz', 'Joerg Widmer'];;;June 2021;;;MobiSys '21: Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services;;;The performance of wireless communication systems is evolving rapidly, making it difficult to build experimentation platforms that meet the hardware requirements of new standards. The bandwidth of current systems ranges from 160 MHz for IEEE 802.11ac/ax to 2 GHz for Millimeter-Wave (mm-wave) IEEE 802.11ad/ay, and they support up to 8 spatial MIMO streams. Mobile 5G and beyond systems have a similarly diverse set of requirements. To address this, we propose a highly configurable wireless platform that meets such requirements and is both affordable and scalable. It is implemented on a single state-of-the-art FPGA board that can be configured from 4x4 mm-wave MIMO with 2 GHz channels to 8x8 MIMO with 160 MHz channels in sub-6 GHz bands. In addition, multi-band operation will play an important role in future wireless networks and our platform supports mixed configurations with simultaneous use of mm-wave and sub-6 GHz. Finally, the platform supports real-time operation, e.g., for closed-loop MIMO beam training with low-latency, by implementing suitable hardware/software accelerators. We demonstrate the platform's performance in a wide range of experiments.

A Cooperative Memory Network for Personalized Task-oriented Dialogue Systems with Incomplete User Profiles;;;['Jiahuan Pei', 'Pengjie Ren', 'Maarten de Rijke'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;There is increasing interest in developing personalized Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TDSs). Previous work on personalized TDSs often assumes that complete user profiles are available for most or even all users. This is unrealistic because In this paper, we study personalized TDSs without assuming that user profiles are complete. We propose a Cooperative Memory Network (CoMemNN) that has a novel mechanism to gradually enrich user profiles as dialogues progress and to simultaneously improve response selection based on the enriched profiles. Cooperative Memory Network (CoMemNN) consists of two core modules: User Profile Enrichment (UPE) and Dialogue Response Selection (DRS). The former enriches incomplete user profiles by utilizing collaborative information from neighbor users as well as current dialogues. The latter uses the enriched profiles to update the current user query so as to encode more useful information, based on which a personalized response to a user request is selected.  We conduct extensive experiments on the personalized bAbI dialogue benchmark datasets. We find that CoMemNN is able to enrich user profiles effectively, which results in an improvement of 3.06% in terms of response selection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also test the robustness of CoMemNN against incompleteness of user profiles by randomly discarding attribute values from user profiles. Even when discarding 50% of the attribute values, CoMemNN is able to match the performance of the best performing baseline without discarding user profiles, showing the robustness of CoMemNN.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3449843;;;Systems AND Control

WDBT: Wear Characterization, Reduction, and Leveling of DBT Systems for Non-Volatile Memory;;;['Jin Wu', 'Jian Dong', 'Ruili Fang', 'Wen Zhang', 'Wenwen Wang', 'Decheng Zuo'];;;September 2021;;;MEMSYS '21: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Memory Systems;;;Emerging high-capacity and byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) is promising for the next-generation memory system. However, NVM suffers from limited write endurance, as an NVM cell will wear out very soon after a certain number of writes. Therefore, many wear reduction and leveling mechanisms have been proposed for NVM. Nevertheless, most of these mechanisms are developed without the knowledge of application semantics and behaviors. In this paper, we advocate application-level wear management, which allows us to create effective and flexible wear reduction and leveling techniques for specific application domains. Particularly, we find that applications running with dynamic binary translation (DBT) exhibit significantly more writes. This is because DBT systems need to handle architectural differences when translating instructions across different architectures. To address this problem, we present WDBT, which focuses on wear reduction and leveling for DBT systems on NVM. WDBT is designed based on common practices of DBT systems to reduce the majority of writes introduced by DBT. We also implement a prototype of WDBT using a real-world DBT system, QEMU, for multiple popular instruction sets. Experimental results on SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks show that WDBT can effectively reduce writes by 52.09% and 34.48% when emulating x86-64 and RISC-V, respectively. Moreover, the performance overhead of WDBT is negligible.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488423.3519337;;;Systems AND Control
Synergistic Social Technology: Designing Systems with ‘Needs’ that Encourage and Support Social Interaction;;;['Ella Dagan', 'Katherine Isbister'];;;June 2021;;;DIS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference;;;In this paper, we propose a strong concept for interaction design: Synergistic Social Technology (SST).

PATROL: A Velocity Control Framework for Autonomous Vehicle via Spatial-Temporal Reinforcement Learning;;;['Zhi Xu', 'Shuncheng Liu', 'Ziniu Wu', 'Xu Chen', 'Kai Zeng', 'Kai Zheng', 'Han Su'];;;October 2021;;;CIKM '21: Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information &amp; Knowledge Management;;;The largest portion of urban congestion is caused by 'phantom' traffic jams, causing significant delay travel time, fuel waste, and air pollution. It frequently occurs in high-density traffics without any obvious signs of accidents or roadworks. The root cause of 'phantom' traffic jams in one-lane traffics is the sudden change in velocity of some vehicles (i.e. harsh driving behavior (HDB)), which may generate a chain reaction with accumulated impact throughout the vehicles along the lane. This paper makes the first attempt to address this notorious problem in a one-lane traffic environment through velocity control of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, we propose a velocity control framework, called PATROL (sPAtial-temporal ReinfOrcement Learning). First, we design a spatial-temporal graph inside the reinforcement learning model to process and extract the information (e.g. velocity and distance difference) of multiple vehicles ahead across several historical time steps in the interactive environment. Then, we propose an attention mechanism to characterize the vehicle interactions and an LSTM structure to understand the vehicles' driving patterns through time. At last, we modify the reward function used in previous velocity control works to enable the autonomous driving agent to predict the HDB of preceding vehicles and smoothly adjust its velocity, which could alleviate the chain reaction caused by HDB. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of PATROL in alleviating the 'phantom' traffic jam in simulation environments. Further, on the real-world velocity control dataset, our method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of driving safety, comfortability, and efficiency.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459637.3482283;;;Systems AND Control
CommanderGabble: A Universal Attack Against ASR Systems Leveraging Fast Speech;;;['Zhaohe (John) Zhang', 'Edwin Yang', 'Song Fang'];;;December 2021;;;ACSAC '21: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference;;;Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are widely used in various online transcription services and personal digital assistants. Emerging lines of research have demonstrated that ASR systems are vulnerable to hidden voice commands, i.e., audio that can be recognized by ASRs but not by humans. Such attacks, however, often either highly depend on white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model or require special hardware to construct the adversarial audio. This paper proposes a new model-agnostic and easily-constructed attack, called CommanderGabble, which uses fast speech to camouflage voice commands. Both humans and ASR systems often misinterpret fast speech, and such misinterpretation can be exploited to launch hidden voice command attacks. Specifically, by carefully manipulating the phonetic structure of a target voice command, ASRs can be caused to derive a hidden meaning from the manipulated, high-speed version. We implement the discovered attacks both over-the-wire and over-the-air, and conduct a suite of experiments to demonstrate their efficacy against 7 practical ASR systems. Our experimental results show that the over-the-wire attacks can disguise as many as 96 out of 100 tested voice commands into adversarial ones, and that the over-the-air attacks are consistently successful for all 18 chosen commands in multiple real-world scenarios.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485832.3485892;;;Systems AND Control

Integrating Collaboration and Leadership in Conversational Group Recommender Systems;;;['David Contreras', 'Maria Salamó', 'Ludovico Boratto'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Information Systems;;;Recent observational studies highlight the importance of considering the interactions between users in the group recommendation process, but to date their integration has been marginal.

The collaborative model allows the group recommender to implicitly infer the different roles within the group, namely, collaborative and leader user(s). Moreover, it serves as the basis of several novel collaboration-based consensus strategies that integrate both individual and social interactions in the group recommendation process. A live-user evaluation confirms that our approach accurately identifies the collaborative and leader users in a group and produces more effective recommendations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462759;;;Systems AND Control
Counterexample-guided inductive synthesis for probabilistic systems;;;['Milan Češka', 'Christian Hensel', 'Sebastian Junges', 'Joost-Pieter Katoen'];;;None;;;Formal Aspects of Computing;;;AbstractThis paper presents counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) to automatically synthesise probabilistic models. The starting point is a family of finite-stateMarkov chains with related but distinct topologies. Such families can succinctly be described by a sketch of a probabilistic program. Program sketches are programs containing holes. Every hole has a finite repertoire of possible program snippets by which it can be filled.We study several synthesis problems—feasibility, optimal synthesis, and complete partitioning—for a given quantitative specification φ. Feasibility amounts to determine a family member satisfying φ, optimal synthesis amounts to find a family member that maximises the probability to satisfy φ, and complete partitioning splits the family in satisfying and refuting members. Each of these problems can be considered under the additional constraint of minimising the total cost of instantiations, e.g., what are all possible instantiations for φ that are within a certain budget? The synthesis problems are tackled using a CEGIS approach. The crux is to aggressively prune the search space by using counterexamples provided by a probabilistic model checker. Counterexamples can be viewed as sub-Markov chains that rule out all family members that share this sub-chain. Our CEGIS approach leverages efficient probabilisticmodel checking,modern SMT solving, and programsnippets as counterexamples. Experiments on case studies froma diverse nature—controller synthesis, program sketching, and security—show that synthesis among up to a million candidate designs can be done using a few thousand verification queries.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00165-021-00547-2;;;Systems AND Control
Embracing Collisions to Increase Fidelity of Sensing Systems with COTS Tags;;;['Jiaqi Xu', 'Wei Sun', 'Kannan Srinivasan'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies;;;RFID techniques have been extensively used in sensing systems due to their low cost. However, limited by the structural simplicity, collision is one key issue which is inevitable in RFID systems, thus limiting the accuracy and scalability of such sensing systems. Existing anti-collision techniques try to enable parallel decoding without sensing based applications in mind, which can not operate on COTS RFID systems. To address the issue, we propose COFFEE, which enables parallel channel estimation of COTS passive tags by harnessing the collision. We revisit the physical layer design of current standard. By exploiting the characteristics of low sampling rate and channel diversity of RFID tags, we separate the collided data and extract the channels of the collided tags. We also propose a tag identification algorithm which explores history channel information and identify the tags without decoding. COFFEE is compatible with current COTS RFID standards which can be applied to all RFID-based sensing systems without any modification on tag side. To evaluate the real world performance of our system, we build a prototype and conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that we can achieve up to 7.33x median time resolution gain for the best case and 3.42x median gain on average.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3463497;;;Systems AND Control

The low-cost requirement restricts the solution to smartphones and other inexpensive equipment readily available, such as drones, as well as mostly Open Source Software.

Architecting Internet of Things Systems with Blockchain: A Catalog of Tactics;;;['Wendy Yánez', 'Rami Bahsoon', 'Yuqun Zhang', 'Rick Kazman'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology;;;Blockchain offers a distributed ledger to record data collected from Internet of Thing (IoT) devices as immutable and tamper-proof transactions and securely shared among authorized participants in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. Despite the growing interest in using blockchain for securing IoT systems, there is a general lack of systematic research and comprehensive review of the design issues on the integration of blockchain and IoT from the software architecture perspective. This article presents a catalog of architectural tactics for the design of IoT systems supported by blockchain as a result of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on IoT and blockchain to extract the commonly reported quality attributes, design decisions, and relevant architectural tactics for the architectural design of this category of systems. Our findings are threefold:<?brk?> (i) identification of security, scalability, performance, and interoperability as the commonly reported quality attributes; (ii) a catalog of twelve architectural tactics for the design of IoT systems supported by blockchain; and (iii) gaps in research that include tradeoffs among quality attributes and identified tactics. These tactics might provide architects and designers with different options when searching for an optimal architectural design that meets the quality attributes of interest and constraints of a system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442412;;;Systems AND Control
A comparison of performance specialization learning for configurable systems;;;['Hugo Martin', 'Mathieu Acher', 'Juliana Alves Pereira', 'Jean-Marc Jézéquel'];;;September 2021;;;SPLC '21: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference - Volume A;;;The specialization of the configuration space of a software system has been considered for targeting specific configuration profiles, usages, deployment scenarios, or hardware settings. The challenge is to find constraints among options' values that only retain configurations meeting a performance objective. Since the exponential nature of configurable systems makes a manual specialization unpractical, several approaches have considered its automation using machine learning, i.e., measuring a sample of configurations and then learning what options' values should be constrained. Even focusing on learning techniques based on decision trees for their built-in explainability, there is still a wide range of possible approaches that need to be evaluated, i.e., how accurate is the specialization with regards to sampling size, performance thresholds, and kinds of configurable systems. In this paper, we compare six learning techniques: three variants of decision trees (including a novel algorithm) with and without the use of model-based feature selection. We first perform a study on 8 configurable systems considered in previous related works and show that the accuracy reaches more than 90% and that feature selection can improve the results in the majority of cases. We then perform a study on the Linux kernel and show that these techniques performs as well as on the other systems. Overall, our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all learning variant (though high accuracy can be achieved): we present guidelines and discuss tradeoffs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461001.3471155;;;Systems AND Control
Architectural Patterns for Integrating AI Technology into Safety-Critical Systems;;;['Georg Macher', 'Matthias Seidl', 'Maid Dzambic', 'Jürgen Dobaj'];;;July 2021;;;EuroPLoP'21: 26th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs;;;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely acknowledged as one of the most disruptive technologies driving the digital transformation of industries, enterprises, and societies in the 21st century. Advances in computing speed, algorithmic improvements, and access to a vast amount of data contributed to the adaption of AI in many different domains. Due to the outstanding performance, AI technology is increasingly integrated into safety-critical applications. However, the established safety engineering processes and practices have been only successfully applied in conventional model-based system development and no commonly agreed approaches for integrating AI technology are available yet. This work presents two architectural patterns that can support designers and engineers in the conception of safety-critical AI-enhanced cyber-physical system (CPS) applications. The first pattern addresses the problem of integrating AI capabilities into safety-critical functions. The second pattern deals with architectural approaches to integrate AI technologies for monitoring and learning system-specific behavior at runtime.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3489449.3490014;;;Systems AND Control

Detection and Mitigation of Sensor and CAN Bus Attacks in Vehicle Anti-Lock Braking Systems;;;['Liuwang Kang', 'Haiying Shen'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;For a modern vehicle, if the sensor in a vehicle anti-lock braking system (ABS) or controller area network (CAN) bus is attacked during a brake process, the vehicle will lose driving direction control and the driver’s life will be highly threatened. However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate, and no method can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack (SA) and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation that considers the real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of attack) by minimizing errors between the predicted vehicle states and the measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from the measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for a vehicle ABS. We conducted the first real SA experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our simulation results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect SA and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also that our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates the attack’s effects on a vehicle ABS.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3495534;;;Systems AND Control
Unrealizable Cores for Reactive Systems Specifications;;;['Shahar Maoz', 'Rafi Shalom'];;;May 2021;;;ICSE '21: Proceedings of the 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering;;;One of the main challenges of reactive synthesis, an automated procedure to obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system, is to deal with unrealizable specifications. One means to deal with unrealizability, in the context of GR(1), an expressive assume-guarantee fragment of LTL that enables efficient synthesis, is the computation of an unrealizable core, which can be viewed as a fault-localization approach. Existing solutions, however, are computationally costly, are limited to computing a single core, and do not correctly support specifications with constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements. In this work we address these limitations. First, we present QuickCore, a novel algorithm that accelerates unrealizable core computations by relying on the monotonicity of unrealizability, on an incremental computation, and on additional properties of GR(1) specifications. Second, we present Punch, a novel algorithm to efficiently compute all unrealizable cores of a specification. Finally, we present means to correctly handle specifications that include higher-level constructs beyond pure GR(1) elements. We implemented our ideas on top of Spectra, an open-source language and synthesis environment. Our evaluation over benchmarks from the literature shows that QuickCore is in most cases faster than previous algorithms, and that its relative advantage grows with scale. Moreover, we found that most specifications include more than one core, and that Punch finds all the cores significantly faster than a competing naive algorithm.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00016;;;Systems AND Control
Dynamic row activation mechanism for multi-core systems;;;['Tareq Alawneh', 'Raimund Kirner', 'Catherine Menon'];;;May 2021;;;CF '21: Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers;;;The power that stems from modern DRAM devices represents a significant portion of the overall system power in modern computing systems. In multi-core systems, the competing cores share the same memory banks. The memory contention between these cores may lead to activate a large DRAM row only to access a small portion of data. This row over-fetching problem wastes a significant DRAM activation power with a slight performance gain. In this paper, we propose a dynamic row activation mechanism, in which the optimal size of DRAM rows is detected at run-time based on monitoring the behavioural changes of the memory requests in accessing sub-rows. The proposed mechanism aims at providing significant memory power savings, reducing the average memory access latency, and maintaining the full DRAM bandwidth. Our experimental results using four-core multi-programming workloads revealed that the proposed mechanism in this study can achieve both significant memory power reduction and average DRAM memory access latency improvement with negligible area overhead.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457388.3458660;;;Systems AND Control
Design and Analysis of Intelligent Text Entry Systems with Function Structure Models and Envelope Analysis;;;['Per Ola Kristensson', 'Thomas Müllners'];;;May 2021;;;CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems;;;Designing intelligent interactive text entry systems often relies on factors that are difficult to estimate or assess using traditional HCI design and evaluation methods. We introduce a complementary approach by adapting function structure models from engineering design. We extend their use by extracting controllable and uncontrollable parameters from function structure models and visualizing their impact using envelope analysis. Function structure models allow designers to understand a system in terms of its functions and flows between functions and decouple functions from function carriers. Envelope analysis allows the designer to further study how parameters affect variables of interest, for example, accuracy, keystroke savings and other dependent variables. We provide examples of function structure models and illustrate a complete envelope analysis by investigating a parameterized function structure model of predictive text entry. We discuss the implications of this design approach for both text entry system design and for critique of system contributions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445566;;;Systems AND Control

Low-memory and high-performance CNN inference on distributed systems at the edge;;;['Erqian Tang', 'Todor Stefanov'];;;December 2021;;;UCC '21: Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion;;;Nowadays, some applications need CNN inference on resource-constrained edge devices that may have very limited memory and computation capacity to fit a large CNN model. In such application scenarios, to deploy a large CNN model and perform inference on a single edge device is not feasible. A possible solution approach is to deploy a large CNN model on a (fully) distributed system at the edge and take advantage of all available edge devices to cooperatively perform the CNN inference. We have observed that existing methodologies, utilizing different partitioning strategies to deploy a CNN model and perform inference at the edge on a distributed system, have several disadvantages. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel partitioning strategy, called Vertical Partitioning Strategy, together with a novel methodology needed to utilize our partitioning strategy efficiently, for CNN model inference on a distributed system at the edge. We compare our experimental results on the YOLOv2 CNN model with results obtained by the existing three methodologies and show the advantages of our methodologies in terms of memory requirement per edge device and overall system performance. Moreover, our experimental results on other representative CNN models show that our novel methodology utilizing our novel partitioning strategy is able to deliver CNN inference with very reduced memory requirement per edge device and improved overall system performance at the same time.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3492323.3495629;;;Systems AND Control

Method of Controlling a Tankendo Robot Using a Mecanum Wheel Trolley Robot;;;['Chenyang Zhao', 'Takeshi Shibuya', 'Naoki Igo', 'Kiyoshi Hoshino'];;;February 2022;;;ICIIT '22: Proceedings of the 2022 7th International Conference on Intelligent Information Technology;;;Tankendo which is a form of martial arts that originated in Japan is suitable for even aged persons or women and is good for promotion of health since a short and easy to maneuver shinai (bamboo sword) is used during matches as well as during practice. However, since the population of persons active in Tankendo is small, it is not easy to gain experience of actual play against other human players. In this research, the authors propose a method of control of a Tankendo robot that employs a trolley robot that uses a mecanum wheel as the movement mechanism. Although this robot cannot start suddenly or stop suddenly like humans, since it has seven pivots, it is possible to finely control the direction or posture of the vehicle as well as its speed. The control commands are of the three types of “speed”, “direction of travel”, and “rotation ratio (curvature of the curve)”, and, in addition, trapezoidal speed control is being carried out in order to prevent loss of synchronization. In other words, there is a time delay until the target speed of the control command is reached. Using a trolley robot with these characteristics, the inputs are the "robot state" (position, posture, etc.) and the "opponent state" (direction of the shinai, movement speed, distance from the opponent, etc.) at the current instant of time, and the "robot control commands" from several instants of time earlier. For the output, an optimal reference table using "speed," "direction of travel," and " rotation ratio" is machine-learned using reinforcement learning. The authors propose a robot control method that can defend against a human attack by moving to an appropriate position at an appropriate time, just before the attack becomes effective strike.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524889.3524910;;;Systems AND Control
Automatically enforcing fresh and consistent inputs in intermittent systems;;;['Milijana Surbatovich', 'Limin Jia', 'Brandon Lucia'];;;June 2021;;;PLDI 2021: Proceedings of the 42nd ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation;;;Intermittently powered energy-harvesting devices enable new applications in inaccessible environments. Program executions must be robust to unpredictable power failures, introducing new challenges in programmability and correctness. One hard problem is that input operations have implicit constraints, embedded in the behavior of continuously powered executions, on when input values can be collected and used. This paper aims to develop a formal framework for enforcing these constraints. We identify two key properties---freshness (i.e., uses of inputs must satisfy the same time constraints as in continuous executions) and temporal consistency (i.e., the collection of a set of inputs must satisfy the same time constraints as in continuous executions). We formalize these properties and show that they can be enforced using atomic regions. We develop Ocelot, an LLVM-based analysis and transformation tool targeting Rust, to enforce these properties automatically. Ocelot provides the programmer with annotations to express these constraints and infers atomic region placement in a program to satisfy them. We then formalize Ocelot's design and show that Ocelot generates correct programs with little performance cost or code changes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453483.3454081;;;Systems AND Control
Managing systems evolving in space and time: four challenges for maintenance, evolution and composition of variants;;;['Gabriela Karoline Michelon', 'David Obermann', 'Wesley K. G. Assunção', 'Lukas Linsbauer', 'Paul Grünbacher', 'Alexander Egyed'];;;September 2021;;;SPLC '21: Proceedings of the 25th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference - Volume A;;;Software companies need to provide a large set of features satisfying functional and non-functional requirements of diverse customers, thereby leading to variability in space. Feature location techniques have been proposed to support software maintenance and evolution in space. However, so far only one feature location technique also analyses the evolution in time of system variants, which is required for feature enhancements and bug fixing. Specifically, existing tools for managing a set of systems over time do not offer proper support for keeping track of feature revisions, updating existing variants, and creating new product configurations based on feature revisions. This paper presents four challenges concerning such capabilities for feature (revision) location and composition of new product configurations based on feature/s (revisions). We also provide a benchmark containing a ground truth and support for computing metrics. We hope that this will motivate researchers to provide and evaluate tool-supported approaches aiming at managing systems evolving in space and time. Further, we do not limit the evaluation of techniques to only this benchmark: we introduce and provide instructions on how to use a benchmark extractor for generating ground truth data for other systems. We expect that the feature (revision) location techniques maximize information retrieval in terms of precision, recall, and F-score, while keeping execution time and memory consumption low.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461001.3461660;;;Systems AND Control

Using Machine Learning for Dependable Outlier Detection in Environmental Monitoring Systems;;;['Gonçalo Jesus', 'António Casimiro', 'Anabela Oliveira'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems;;;Sensor platforms used in environmental monitoring applications are often subject to harsh environmental conditions while monitoring complex phenomena. Therefore, designing dependable monitoring systems is challenging given the external disturbances affecting sensor measurements. Even the apparently simple task of outlier detection in sensor data becomes a hard problem, amplified by the difficulty in distinguishing true data errors due to sensor faults from deviations due to natural phenomenon, which look like data errors. Existing solutions for runtime outlier detection typically assume that the physical processes can be accurately modeled, or that outliers consist in large deviations that are easily detected and filtered by appropriate thresholds. Other solutions assume that it is possible to deploy multiple sensors providing redundant data to support voting-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new methodology for dependable runtime detection of outliers in environmental monitoring systems, aiming to increase data quality by treating them. We propose the use of machine learning techniques to model each sensor behavior, exploiting the existence of correlated data provided by other related sensors. Using these models, along with knowledge of processed past measurements, it is possible to obtain accurate estimations of the observed environment parameters and build failure detectors that use these estimations. When a failure is detected, these estimations also allow one to correct the erroneous measurements and hence improve the overall data quality. Our methodology not only allows one to distinguish truly abnormal measurements from deviations due to complex natural phenomena, but also allows the quantification of each measurement quality, which is relevant from a dependability perspective.We apply the methodology to real datasets from a complex aquatic monitoring system, measuring temperature and salinity parameters, through which we illustrate the process for building the machine learning prediction models using a technique based on Artificial Neural Networks, denoted ANNODE (ANN Outlier Detection). From this application, we also observe the effectiveness of our ANNODE approach for accurate outlier detection in harsh environments. Then we validate these positive results by comparing ANNODE with state-of-the-art solutions for outlier detection. The results show that ANNODE improves existing solutions regarding accuracy of outlier detection.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445812;;;Systems AND Control

Climate change, rapid urbanization, and unplanned disaster management further increase trends of urban floods with higher frequency and intensity. This study employs data-driven machine learning (ML) models for predicting the flooding susceptibility of public transit systems in Toronto, ON, Canada. Four ML approaches are employed to evaluate the future risks of public transit systems being inundated by flooding events: 1) Random Forest (RF); 2) eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); 3) K Nearest Neighbor (KNN); and 4) Naïve Bayes (NB). We estimate flooding probability based on the relationship between flood inundation events and their contributing factors. Flood-plain maps by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) are used to generate flood and non-flood locations as a basis for training (70% of samples) and validating (30% of samples) ML models. We use the Area-Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the prediction results of ML models. All four models show a high level of accuracy higher than 95%. Our results demonstrate public transit systems near major river channels are highly susceptible to floods which corroborated with historical flooding incidents in 2013 and 2018. The outcome of the study can be helpful to enhance the resilience of public transit systems in the city of Toronto and can facilitate evidence-based planning and policy to make cities more sustainable, livable, and resilient against flood hazards.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486626.3493438;;;Systems AND Control
REFIT: A Unified Watermark Removal Framework For Deep Learning Systems With Limited Data;;;['Xinyun Chen', 'Wenxiao Wang', 'Chris Bender', 'Yiming Ding', 'Ruoxi Jia', 'Bo Li', 'Dawn Song'];;;May 2021;;;ASIA CCS '21: Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security;;;Training deep neural networks from scratch could be computationally expensive and requires a lot of training data. Recent work has explored different watermarking techniques to protect the pre-trained deep neural networks from potential copyright infringements. However, these techniques could be vulnerable to watermark removal attacks. In this work, we propose REFIT, a unified watermark removal framework based on fine-tuning, which does not rely on the knowledge of the watermarks, and is effective against a wide range of watermarking schemes. In particular, we conduct a comprehensive study of a realistic attack scenario where the adversary has limited training data, which has not been emphasized in prior work on attacks against watermarking schemes. To effectively remove the watermarks without compromising the model functionality under this weak threat model, we propose two techniques that are incorporated into our fine-tuning framework: (1) an adaption of the elastic weight consolidation (EWC) algorithm, which is originally proposed for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon; and (2) unlabeled data augmentation (AU), where we leverage auxiliary unlabeled data from other sources. Our extensive evaluation shows the effectiveness of REFIT against diverse watermark embedding schemes. In particular, both EWC and AU significantly decrease the amount of labeled training data needed for effective watermark removal, and the unlabeled data samples used for AU do not necessarily need to be drawn from the same distribution as the benign data for model evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuning based watermark removal attacks could pose real threats to the copyright of pre-trained models, and thus highlight the importance of further investigating the watermarking problem and proposing more robust watermark embedding schemes against the attacks.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3433210.3453079;;;Systems AND Control
Learning Recommender Systems with Implicit Feedback via Soft Target Enhancement;;;['Mingyue Cheng', 'Fajie Yuan', 'Qi Liu', 'Shenyang Ge', 'Zhi Li', 'Runlong Yu', 'Defu Lian', 'Senchao Yuan', 'Enhong Chen'];;;July 2021;;;SIGIR '21: Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval;;;One-hot encoder accompanied by a softmax loss has become the default configuration to deal with the multiclass problem, and is also prevalent in deep learning (DL) based recommender systems (RS). The standard learning process of such methods is to fit the model outputs to a one-hot encoding of the ground truth, referred to as the hard target. However, it is known that these hard targets largely ignore the ambiguity of unobserved feedback in RS, and thus may lead to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this work, we propose SoftRec, a new RS optimization framework to enhance item recommendation. The core idea is that we add additional supervisory signals - well-designed soft targets - for each instance so as to better guide the recommender learning. Meanwhile, we carefully investigate the impacts of specific soft target distributions by instantiating the SoftRec with a series of strategies, including item-based, user-based, and model-based. To verify the effectiveness of SoftRec, we conduct extensive experiments on two public recommendation datasets by using various deep recommendation architectures. The experimental results show that our methods achieve superior performance compared with the standard optimization approaches. Moreover, SoftRec could also exhibit strong performance in cold-start scenarios where user-item interaction has higher sparsity.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3462863;;;Systems AND Control

This paper mainly uses the experimental analysis method and data collection method to carry out the corresponding research on the adaptive particle swarm and grid ES configuration system. The experimental results show that the network loss cost is controlled at about 10,000 yuan in the APWA. Its loss is lower than other algorithms. Therefore, the APWA can be used for calculation and research in ES control.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3495018.3495527;;;Systems AND Control
Mitigating Gender Bias in Captioning Systems;;;['Ruixiang Tang', 'Mengnan Du', 'Yuening Li', 'Zirui Liu', 'Na Zou', 'Xia Hu'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;Image captioning has made substantial progress with huge supporting image collections sourced from the web. However, recent studies have pointed out that captioning datasets, such as COCO, contain gender bias found in web corpora. As a result, learning models could heavily rely on the learned priors and image context for gender identification, leading to incorrect or even offensive errors. To encourage models to learn correct gender features, we reorganize the COCO dataset and present two new splits COCO-GB V1 and V2 datasets where the train and test sets have different gender-context joint distribution. Models relying on contextual cues will suffer from huge gender prediction errors on the anti-stereotypical test data. Benchmarking experiments reveal that most captioning models learn gender bias, leading to high gender prediction errors, especially for women. To alleviate the unwanted bias, we propose a new Guided Attention Image Captioning model (GAIC) which provides self-guidance on visual attention to encourage the model to capture correct gender visual evidence. Experimental results validate that GAIC can significantly reduce gender prediction errors with a competitive caption quality. Our codes and the designed benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/datamllab/Mitigating_Gender_Bias_In_Captioning_System.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3449950;;;Systems AND Control
Secure Chaff-less Fuzzy Vault for Face Identification Systems;;;['Xingbo Dong', 'Soohyong Kim', 'Zhe Jin', 'Jung Yeon Hwang', 'Sangrae Cho', 'Andrew Beng Jin Teoh'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications;;;Biometric cryptosystems such as fuzzy vaults represent one of the most popular approaches for secret and biometric template protection. However, they are solely designed for biometric verification, where the user is required to input both identity credentials and biometrics. Several practical questions related to the implementation of biometric cryptosystems remain open, especially in regard to biometric template protection. In this article, we propose a face cryptosystem for identification (FCI) in which only biometric input is needed. Our FCI is composed of a one-to-N search subsystem for template protection and a one-to-one match chaff-less fuzzy vault (CFV) subsystem for secret protection. The first subsystem stores N facial features, which are protected by index-of-maximum (IoM) hashing, enhanced by a fusion module for search accuracy. When a face image of the user is presented, the subsystem returns the top k matching scores and activates the corresponding vaults in the CFV subsystem. Then, one-to-one matching is applied to the k vaults based on the probe face, and the identifier or secret associated with the user is retrieved from the correct matched vault. We demonstrate that coupling between the IoM hashing and the CFV resolves several practical issues related to fuzzy vault schemes. The FCI system is evaluated on three large-scale public unconstrained face datasets (LFW, VGG2, and IJB-C) in terms of its accuracy, computation cost, template protection criteria, and security.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442198;;;Systems AND Control

Dataflow Model–based Software Synthesis Framework for Parallel and Distributed Embedded Systems;;;['Eunjin Jeong', 'Dowhan Jeong', 'Soonhoi Ha'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems;;;Existing software development methodologies mostly assume that an application runs on a single device without concern about the non-functional requirements of an embedded system such as latency and resource consumption. Besides, embedded software is usually developed after the hardware platform is determined, since a non-negligible portion of the code depends on the hardware platform. In this article, we present a novel model-based software synthesis framework for parallel and distributed embedded systems. An application is specified as a set of tasks with the given rules for execution and communication. Having such rules enables us to perform static analysis to check some software errors at compile-time to reduce the verification difficulty. Platform-specific programs are synthesized automatically after the mapping of tasks onto processing elements is determined. The proposed framework is expandable to support new hardware platforms easily. The proposed communication code synthesis method is extensible and flexible to support various communication methods between devices. In addition, the fault-tolerant feature can be added by modifying the task graph automatically according to the selected fault-tolerance configurations by the user. The viability of the proposed software development methodology is evaluated with a real-life surveillance application that runs on six processing elements.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447680;;;Systems AND Control

A lane-changing model can meet its own requirements, but it may be incompatible with another lane-changing model. In this paper, we verify if two lane-changing models are compatible so that the two corresponding vehicles on different lanes can exchange their lanes successfully. We propose a methodology and an algorithm to perform the verification on the combinations of four lane-changing models. Experimental results demonstrate the compatibility (or incompatibility) between the models. The verification results can be utilized during runtime to prevent incompatible vehicles from entering a lane-changing road segment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work considering the compatibility issue for lane-changing models.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3539845.3540119;;;Systems AND Control
Quantifying server memory frequency margin and using it to improve performance in HPC systems;;;['Da Zhang', 'Gagandeep Panwar', 'Jagadish B. Kotra', 'Nathan DeBardeleben', 'Sean Blanchard', 'Xun Jian'];;;June 2021;;;ISCA '21: Proceedings of the 48th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture;;;To maintain strong reliability, memory manufacturers label server memories at much slower data rates than the highest data rates at which they can still operate correctly for most (e.g., 99.999%+ of) accesses; we refer to the gap between these two data rates as memory frequency margin. While many prior works have studied memory latency margins in a different context of consumer memories, none has publicly studied memory frequency margin (either for consumer or server memories). To close this knowledge gap in the public domain, we perform the first public study to characterize frequency margins in commodity server memory modules. Through our large-scale study, we find that under standard voltage and cooling, they can operate 27% faster, on average, without error(s) for 99.999%+ of accesses even at high temperatures. The current practice of conservatively operating server memory is far from ideal; it slows down 99.999%+ of accesses to benefit the <0.001% of accesses that would be erroneous at a faster data rate. An ideal system should only pay this reliability tax for the <0.001% of accesses that actually need it. Towards unleashing ideal performance, our second contribution is performing the first exploration on exploiting server memory frequency margin to maximize performance. We focus on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, where performance is paramount. We propose exploiting HPC systems' abundant free memory in the common case to store copies of every data block and operate the copies unreliably fast to speedup common-case accesses; we use the safely-operated original blocks for recovery when the unsafely-operated copies become corrupted. We refer to our idea as Heterogeneously-accessed Dual Module Redundancy (Hetero-DMR). Hetero-DMR improves node-level performance by 18%, on average across two CPU memory hierarchies and six HPC benchmark suites, while weighted by different frequency margins and different levels of memory utilization. We also use a real system to emulate the speedup of Hetero-DMR over a conventional system; it closely matches simulation. Our system-wide simulations show applying Hetero-DMR to an HPC system provides 1.4x average speedup on job turnaround time. To facilitate adoption, Hetero-DMR also rigorously preserves system reliability and works for commodity DIMMs and CPU-memory interfaces.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ISCA52012.2021.00064;;;Systems AND Control
Understanding User Sensemaking in Machine Learning Fairness Assessment Systems;;;['Ziwei Gu', 'Jing Nathan Yan', 'Jeffrey M.

These systems approach bias reduction from a number of perspectives, including recommender systems, exploratory tools, and dashboards. In this paper, we seek to inform the design of these systems by examining how individuals make sense of fairness issues as they use different de-biasing affordances. In particular, we consider the tension between de-biasing recommendations which are quick but may lack nuance and ”what-if” style exploration which is time consuming but may lead to deeper understanding and transferable insights. Using logs, think-aloud data, and semi-structured interviews we find that exploratory systems promote a rich pattern of hypothesis generation and testing, while recommendations deliver quick answers which satisfy participants at the cost of reduced information exposure. We highlight design requirements and trade-offs in the design of ML fairness systems to promote accurate and explainable assessments.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450092;;;Systems AND Control

Feature-Interaction Sampling for Scenario-based Testing of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems✱;;;['Lukas Birkemeyer', 'Tobias Pett', 'Andreas Vogelsang', 'Christoph Seidl', 'Ina Schaefer'];;;February 2022;;;VaMoS '22: Proceedings of the 16th International Working Conference on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems;;;Scenario-based testing is considered state-of-the-art to verify and validate Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. However, two essential unsolved challenges prevent the practical application of scenario-based testing according to the SOTIF-standard: (1) how to select a set of representative test scenarios, and (2) how to assess the effectiveness of a test scenario suite. In this paper, we leverage variability modelling techniques to select scenarios from a scenario space and assess the resulting scenario suites with a mutation score as metric. We capture the scenario space in a feature model and generate representative subsets with feature-interaction coverage sampling. The mutation score assesses the failure-finding effectiveness of these samples. We evaluate our concepts by sampling scenario suites for two independent Autonomous Emergency Braking function implementations and executing them on an industrial-strength simulator. Our results show that the feature model captures a scenario space that is relevant to identify all mutants. We show that sampling based on interaction coverage reduces the testing effort significantly while maintaining effectiveness in terms of mutation scores. Our results underline the potential of feature model sampling for testing in the automotive industry.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510466.3510474;;;Systems AND Control
A Fast Hierarchical Physical Topology Update Scheme for Edge-Cloud Collaborative IoT Systems;;;['Tianqi Yu', 'Xianbin Wang', 'Jianling Hu'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;The awareness of physical network topology in a large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) system is critical to enable location-based service provisioning and performance optimization. However, due to the dynamics and complexity of IoT networks, it is usually very difficult to discover and update the physical topology of the large-scale IoT systems in real-time. Considering the stringent latency requirements in IoT systems, while the initial processing time for topology discovery can be tolerated, latency due to real-time topology update constitutes an even higher level of challenge. In this paper, a novel fast hierarchical topology update scheme is proposed for the large-scale IoT systems enabled by using the edge-cloud collaborative architecture. Specifically, an event-driven neighbor update algorithm, termed as TriggerOn, is firstly developed to update the local neighbor table of the end devices when device association or disassociation occurs. Based on the updated neighbor tables, the physical topology update of the subnet is conducted at the coordinated edge device, where a hybrid multidimensional scaling (MDS) based 3D localization algorithm is developed to locate the newly associated devices. Simulation results have indicated that as compared to the benchmark methods, the neighbor discovery latency has been reduced dramatically, and the 3D localization accuracy has been improved. Furthermore, the overall latency incurred by the proposed hierarchical physical topology update scheme is significantly lower than the distributed consensus-based update scheme, especially for the large-scale IoT subnets.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3085031;;;Systems AND Control
The Physical Design of Biological Systems - Insights from the Fly Brain;;;['Louis K. Scheffer'];;;March 2021;;;ISPD '21: Proceedings of the 2021 International Symposium on Physical Design;;;Many different physical substrates can support complex computation. This is particularly apparent when considering human made and biological systems that perform similar functions, such as visually guided navigation. In common, however, is the need for good physical design, as such designs are smaller, faster, lighter, and lower power, factors in both the jungle and the marketplace. Although the physical design of man-made systems is relatively well understood, the physical design of biological computation has remained murky due to a lack of detailed information on their construction. The recent EM (electron microscope) reconstruction of the central brain of the fruit fly now allows us to start to examine these issues. Here we look at the physical design of the fly brain, including such factors as fan-in and fanout, logic depth, division into physical compartments and how this affects electrical response, pin to computation ratios (Rent's rule), and other physical characteristics of at least one biological computation substrate. From this we speculate on how physical design algorithms might change if the target implementation was a biological neural network.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3439706.3446898;;;Systems AND Control
Generalized Weight Agnostic Neural Networks for Configurable and Continual Autonomous Systems;;;['Pranav U Gadikar', 'Vinod Ganesan', 'Pratyush Kumar Panda'];;;October 2021;;;AIMLSystems '21: Proceedings of the First International Conference on AI-ML Systems;;;Implementing pervasive intelligence faces the challenges of efficient, continual, and configurable learning on embedded devices. We address these challenges with two novel extensions to Weight Agnostic Neural Networks (WANNs) namely – (i) Multi-weight extension and (ii) Multi-objective extension. In the multi-weight extension, we extend the idea of single shared weight WANNs to multiple weights to enable efficient continual learning. Our results across four different tasks implemented on Raspberry Pi demonstrate that the multi-weight WANNs achieve higher reward as compared to single shared weight WANNs and can be fine-tuned on device in orders of magnitude smaller time. In the multi-objective extension of WANNs, we extend the idea of a single reward function to multiple competing rewards and demonstrate sensitive and monotonic trade-off between multiple competing rewards to enable efficient configurable learning. We also demonstrate robustness of WANNs for changes in the weight parameters and changes in the environmental conditions as compared to the Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) algorithm. These significant results open the possibility of truly autonomous agents using WANNs on low compute and power budget devices.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486001.3486226;;;Systems AND Control

We conducted interaction analysis of moments from two cases in which a parent and their daughter worked together to choose and input numerical values in their codes that would send the robot in a desired direction. Our analyses reveal how parents and children decide on this value through a process of mapping across symbol systems. We suggest that a shared understanding of these symbols’ meaning is critical for the mapping process, and that the process is impacted by the affordances of the representational tools the pair employs.

Ensemble Prediction of Job Resources to Improve System Performance for Slurm-Based HPC Systems;;;['Mohammed Tanash', 'Huichen Yang', 'Daniel Andresen', 'William Hsu'];;;July 2021;;;PEARC '21: Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing;;;In this paper, we present a novel methodology for predicting job resources (memory and time) for submitted jobs on HPC systems. Our methodology based on historical jobs data (saccount data) provided from the Slurm workload manager using supervised machine learning. This Machine Learning (ML) prediction model is effective and useful for both HPC administrators and HPC users. Moreover, our ML model increases the efficiency and utilization for HPC systems, thus reduce power consumption as well. Our model involves using Several supervised machine learning discriminative models from the scikit-learn machine learning library and LightGBM applied on historical data from Slurm.  Our model helps HPC users to determine the required amount of resources for their submitted jobs and make it easier for them to use HPC resources efficiently. This work provides the second step towards implementing our general open source tool towards HPC service providers. For this work, our Machine learning model has been implemented and tested using two HPC providers, an XSEDE service provider (University of Colorado-Boulder (RMACC Summit) and Kansas State University (Beocat)).  We used more than two hundred thousand jobs: one-hundred thousand jobs from SUMMIT and one-hundred thousand jobs from Beocat, to model and assess our ML model performance. In particular we measured the improvement of running time, turnaround time, average waiting time for the submitted jobs; and measured utilization of the HPC clusters.  Our model achieved up to  86% accuracy in predicting the amount of time and the amount of memory for both SUMMIT and Beocat HPC resources. Our results show that our model helps dramatically reduce computational average waiting time  (from 380 to 4 hours in RMACC Summit and from 662 hours to 28 hours in Beocat); reduced turnaround time  (from 403 to 6 hours in RMACC Summit and from 673 hours to 35 hours in Beocat); and acheived up to  100% utilization for both HPC resources.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437359.3465574;;;Systems AND Control

Minimizing Age-of-Information in Heterogeneous Multi-Channel Systems: A New Partial-Index Approach;;;['Yihan Zou', 'Kwang Taik Kim', 'Xiaojun Lin', 'Mung Chiang'];;;July 2021;;;MobiHoc '21: Proceedings of the Twenty-second International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing;;;We study how to schedule data sources in a wireless time-sensitive information system with multiple heterogeneous and unreliable channels to minimize the total expected Age-of-Information (AoI). Although one could formulate this problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP), such an approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality and lack of insights. For single-channel systems, prior studies have developed lower-complexity solutions based on the Whittle index. However, Whittle index has not been studied for systems with multiple heterogeneous channels, mainly because indexability is not well defined when there are multiple dual cost values, one for each channel. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce new notions of partial indexability and partial index, which are defined with respect to one channel's cost, given all other channels' costs. We then combine the ideas of partial indices and max-weight matching to develop a Sum Weighted Index Matching (SWIM) policy, which iteratively updates the dual costs and partial indices. The proposed policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal in minimizing the total expected AoI, under a technical condition on a global attractor property. Extensive performance simulations demonstrate that the proposed policy offers significant gains over conventional approaches by achieving a near-optimal AoI. Further, the notion of partial index is of independent interest and could be useful for other problems with multiple heterogeneous resources.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466772.3467030;;;Systems AND Control
Urban Map Inference by Pervasive Vehicular Sensing Systems with Complementary Mobility;;;['Zhihan Fang', 'Guang Wang', 'Xiaoyang Xie', 'Fan Zhang', 'Desheng Zhang'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies;;;Accurate and up-to-date digital road maps are the foundation of many mobile applications, such as navigation and autonomous driving. A manually-created map suffers from the high cost for creation and maintenance due to constant road network updating. Recently, the ubiquity of GPS devices in vehicular systems has led to an unprecedented amount of vehicle sensing data for map inference. Unfortunately, accurate map inference based on vehicle GPS is challenging for two reasons. First, it is challenging to infer complete road structures due to the sensing deviation, sparse coverage, and low sampling rate of GPS of a fleet of vehicles with similar mobility patterns, e.g., taxis. Second, a road map requires various road properties such as road categories, which is challenging to be inferred by just GPS locations of vehicles. In this paper, we design a map inference system called coMap by considering multiple fleets of vehicles with Complementary Mobility Features. coMap has two key components: a graph-based map sketching component, a learning-based map painting component. We implement coMap with the data from four type-aware vehicular sensing systems in one city, which consists of 18 thousand taxis, 10 thousand private vehicles, 6 thousand trucks, and 14 thousand buses. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of coMap with two state-of-the-art baselines along with ground truth based on OpenStreetMap and a commercial map provider, i.e., Baidu Maps. The results show that (i) for the map sketching, our work improves the performance by 15.9%; (ii) for the map painting, our work achieves 74.58% of average accuracy on road category classification.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448076;;;Systems AND Control

Job Dispatching Policies for Queueing Systems with Unknown Service Rates;;;['Tuhinangshu Choudhury', 'Gauri Joshi', 'Weina Wang', 'Sanjay Shakkottai'];;;July 2021;;;MobiHoc '21: Proceedings of the Twenty-second International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing;;;In multi-server queueing systems where there is no central queue holding all incoming jobs, job dispatching policies are used to assign incoming jobs to the queue at one of the servers. Classic job dispatching policies such as join-the-shortest-queue and shortest expected delay assume that the service rates and queue lengths of the servers are known to the dispatcher. In this work, we tackle the problem of job dispatching without the knowledge of service rates and queue lengths, where the dispatcher can only obtain noisy estimates of the service rates by observing job departures. This problem presents a novel exploration-exploitation trade-off between sending jobs to all the servers to estimate their service rates, and exploiting the currently known fastest servers to minimize the expected queueing delay. We propose a bandit-based exploration policy that learns the service rates from observed job departures. Unlike the standard multi-armed bandit problem where only one out of a finite set of actions is optimal, here the optimal policy requires identifying the optimal fraction of incoming jobs to be sent to each server. We present a regret analysis and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bandit-based exploration policy.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3466772.3467047;;;Systems AND Control

Data Poisoning Attacks and Defenses to Crowdsourcing Systems;;;['Minghong Fang', 'Minghao Sun', 'Qi Li', 'Neil Zhenqiang Gong', 'Jin Tian', 'Jia Liu'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;A key challenge of big data analytics is how to collect a large volume of (labeled) data. Crowdsourcing aims to address this challenge via aggregating and estimating high-quality data (e.g., sentiment label for text) from pervasive clients/users. Existing studies on crowdsourcing focus on designing new methods to improve the aggregated data quality from unreliable/noisy clients. However, the security aspects of such crowdsourcing systems remain under-explored to date. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. Specifically, we show that crowdsourcing is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients provide carefully crafted data to corrupt the aggregated data. We formulate our proposed data poisoning attacks as an optimization problem that maximizes the error of the aggregated data.

Progressive Memory Adjustment with Performance Guarantee in Virtualized Systems;;;['Lulu Yao', 'Yongkun Li', 'Jiawei Li', 'Weijie Wu', 'Yinlong Xu'];;;August 2021;;;ICPP '21: Proceedings of the 50th International Conference on Parallel Processing;;;As applications are often allocated more memory than they actually used to cope with peak memory demand due to the workload dynamics in virtualized systems running multiple virtual machines, memory adjustment by reclaiming inactive memory in virtual machines is an effective way to enable memory overcommitment so as to reduce the cost. However, existing schemes are designed based on one-shot adjustment, which may reclaim a large size in a single operation, and they are unaware of both memory access dynamics and memory sensitivity of different applications, so they usually result in excessive reclamation and lead to severe performance slowdown. To address this issue, we propose PMA, a progressive memory adjustment scheme that takes into consideration both memory access dynamics and memory sensitivity and leverages virtual machine performance feedback to progressively reclaim inactive memory to avoid performance slowdown. Besides, PMA is designed based on ballooning (i.e., the balloon driver) so it preserves the good isolation between host and virtual machines for full virtualization systems. We also implement a prototype in host user space, and experiments show that PMA effectively limits the performance drop of memory overcommitment (e.g., the performance drop of every virtual machine is limited within 10% for up to 33% memory overcommitment), which is already very close to the optimal case of having enough memory, so PMA is efficient to enable memory overcommitment with performance guarantee in full virtualization systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472456.3472491;;;Systems AND Control
Quantifying Assimilate-Contrast Effects in Online Rating Systems: Modeling, Analysis and Application;;;['Mingze Zhong', 'Hong Xie', 'Qingsheng Zhu'];;;August 2021;;;KDD '21: Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining;;;Online rating system serves as an indispensable building block for many web applications such as Amazon, TripAdvior and Yelp. It enables production quality estimation via aggregate ratings (a.k.a. wisdom of the crowd) as well as product recommendation via inferring user preference from ratings, etc. Previous studies showed that due to assimilate-contrast effects, historical ratings can significantly distort user's ratings, leading to low accuracy of product quality estimation and recommendation. To understand assimilate-contrast effects, an "accurate'' model is still missing as previous models do not capture important factors like rating recency, selection bias, etc. Furthermore, an analytical framework to characterize product estimation accuracy under assimilate-contrast effects is also missing. This paper aims to fill in this gap. We propose a mathematical model to quantify the aforementioned important factors on assimilate-contrast effects. Our model attains a good balance between model complexity and model accuracy, such that it is neat enough for us to develop an analytical framework to study assimilate-contrast effects. Based on our model, we derive sufficient conditions, under which the product estimation and collective opinion converges to the "ground-truth''. These conditions reveal important insights on how the aforementioned factors influence the convergence and guide the online rating system operator to design appropriate rating aggregation rules and rating displaying strategies. To demonstrate the versatility of our model, we apply to rating prediction tasks and product recommendation tasks. Experiment results on four public datasets show that our model can improve the rating prediction and and recommendation accuracy over previous models significantly.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447548.3467244;;;Systems AND Control
Charting the Design and Analytics Agenda of Learnersourcing Systems;;;['Hassan Khosravi', 'Gianluca Demartini', 'Shazia Sadiq', 'Dragan Gasevic'];;;April 2021;;;LAK21: LAK21: 11th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference;;;Learnersourcing is emerging as a viable learner-centred and pedagogically justified approach for harnessing the creativity and evaluation power of learners as experts-in-training. Despite the increasing adoption of learnersourcing in higher education, understanding students’ behaviour while engaged in learnersourcing and best practices for the design and development of learnersourcing systems are still largely under-researched. This paper offers data-driven reflections and lessons learned from the development and deployment of a learnersourcing adaptive educational system called RiPPLE, which to date, has been used in more than 50-course offerings with over 12,000 students. Our reflections are categorised into examples and best practices on (1) assessing the quality of students’ contributions using accurate, explainable and fair approaches to data analysis, (2) incentivising students to develop high-quality contributions and (3) empowering instructors with actionable and explainable insights to guide student learning. We discuss the implications of these findings and how they may contribute to the growing literature on the development of effective learnersourcing systems and more broadly technological educational solutions that support learner-centred learning at scale.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448139.3448143;;;Systems AND Control
HEART: Hybrid Memory and Energy-Aware Real-Time Scheduling for Multi-Processor Systems;;;['Mario Günzel', 'Christian Hakert', 'Kuan-Hsun Chen', 'Jian-Jia Chen'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems;;;Dynamic power management (DPM) reduces the power consumption of a computing system when it idles, by switching the system into a low power state for hibernation. When all processors in the system share the same component, e.g., a shared memory, powering off this component during hibernation is only possible when all processors idle at the same time. For a real-time system, the schedulability property has to be guaranteed on every processor, especially if idle intervals are considered to be actively introduced.In this work, we consider real-time systems with hybrid shared-memory architectures, which consist of shared volatile memory (VM) and non-volatile memory (NVM). Energy-efficient execution is achieved by applying DPM to turn off all memories during the hibernation mode. Towards this, we first explore the hybrid memory architectures and suggest a task model, which features configurable hibernation overheads. We propose a multi-processor procrastination algorithm (HEART), based on partitioned earliest-deadline-first (pEDF) scheduling. Our algorithm facilitates reducing the energy consumption by actively enlarging the hibernation time. It enforces all processors to idle simultaneously without violating the schedulability condition, such that the system can enter the hibernation state, where shared memories are turned off. Throughout extensive evaluation of HEART, we demonstrate (1) the increase in potential hibernation time, respectively the decrease in energy consumption, and (2) that our algorithm is not only more general but also has better performance than the state of the art with respect to energy efficiency in most cases.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477019;;;Systems AND Control

Common Misunderstandings of Deterrence Theory in Information Systems Research and Future Research Directions;;;['Mikko Siponen', 'Wael Soliman', 'Anthony Vance'];;;February 2022;;;ACM SIGMIS Database: the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems;;;In the 1980s, information systems (IS) borrowed deterrence theory (DT) from the field of criminology to explain information security behaviors (or intention). Today, DT is among the most commonly used theories in IS security research. Our review of IS research applying DT highlights that many fundamental assumptions of DT are unrecognized and therefore unexamined. This may have resulted in misunderstandings and conceptual confusions regarding some of the basic concepts of DT. For example, some IS studies confuse general deterrence with specific deterrence or do not recognize the difference between the two. Moreover, these fundamental assumptions, when directly examined, may provide important information about the applicability of DT in certain IS security contexts. This research commentary aims to identify and discuss some of the fundamental assumptions of DT and their implications for IS research. By examining these assumptions, IS researchers can study the previously unexplored aspects of DT in different IS contexts. Further, by recognizing these assumptions, IS scholars can revise them and build new variants of DT to better account for specific characteristics of IS behaviors and contexts.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3514097.3514101;;;Systems AND Control
Onion: identifying incident-indicating logs for cloud systems;;;['Xu Zhang', 'Yong Xu', 'Si Qin', 'Shilin He', 'Bo Qiao', 'Ze Li', 'Hongyu Zhang', 'Xukun Li', 'Yingnong Dang', 'Qingwei Lin', 'Murali Chintalapati', 'Saravanakumar Rajmohan', 'Dongmei Zhang'];;;August 2021;;;ESEC/FSE 2021: Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering;;;In cloud systems, incidents affect the availability of services and require quick mitigation actions. Once an incident occurs, operators and developers often examine logs to perform fault diagnosis. However, the large volume of diverse logs and the overwhelming details in log data make the manual diagnosis process time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose Onion, an automatic solution for precisely and efficiently locating incident-indicating logs, which can provide useful clues for diagnosing the incidents. We first point out three criteria for localizing incident-indicating logs, i.e., Consistency, Impact, and Bilateral-Difference. Then we propose a novel agglomeration of logs, called log clique, based on which these criteria are satisfied. To obtain log cliques, we develop an incident-aware log representation and a progressive log clustering technique. Contrast analysis is then performed on the cliques to identify the incident-indicating logs. We have evaluated Onion using well-labeled log datasets. Onion achieves an average F1-score of 0.95 and can process millions of logs in only a few minutes, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. Onion has also been successfully applied to the cloud system of Microsoft. Its practicability has been confirmed through the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the real incident cases.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468264.3473919;;;Systems AND Control
Immunizing Systems from Distant Failures by Limiting Lamport Exposure;;;['Cristina Băsescu', 'Bryan Ford'];;;November 2021;;;HotNets '21: Proceedings of the 20th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks;;;Failures far away from a user should intuitively be less likely to affect that user. Today's ecosystem miserably fails this test, however, despite high-availability best practices. Correlated and cascading failures - triggered by misconfigurations, bugs, and network partitions - often invalidate assumptions of failure independence. We propose that distributed services need not and should not expose local activities to distant failures or partitions, no matter how severe. Limix is an exposure-limiting architecture, guaranteeing that neither the availability nor the performance of strongly-consistent accesses within a local area may be impacted by distant failures. Preliminary results suggest that infrastructures today could use Limix to limit exposure at a manageable cost.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3484266.3487387;;;Systems AND Control
Exploiting user activeness for data retention in HPC systems;;;['Wei Zhang', 'Suren Byna', 'Hyogi Sim', 'Sangkeun Lee', 'Sudharshan Vazhkudai', 'Yong Chen'];;;November 2021;;;SC '21: Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis;;;HPC systems typically rely on the fixed-lifetime (FLT) data retention strategy, which only considers temporal locality of data accesses to parallel file systems. However, our extensive analysis based on the leadership-class HPC system traces suggests that the FLT approach often fails to capture the dynamics in users' behavior and leads to undesired data purge. In this study, we propose an activeness-based data retention (ActiveDR) solution, which advocates considering the data retention approach from a holistic activeness-based perspective. By evaluating the frequency and impact of users' activities, ActiveDR prioritizes the file purge process for inactive users and rewards active users with extended file lifetime on parallel storage. Our extensive evaluations based on the traces of the prior Titan supercomputer show that, when reaching the same purge target, ActiveDR achieves up to 37% file miss reduction as compared to the current FLT retention methodology.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458817.3476201;;;Systems AND Control
Vulnerabilities of Unattended Face Verification Systems to Facial Components-based Presentation Attacks: An Empirical Study;;;['Le Qin', 'Fei Peng', 'Min Long', 'Raghavendra Ramachandra', 'Christoph Busch'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security;;;As face presentation attacks (PAs) are realistic threats for unattended face verification systems, face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been intensively investigated in past years, and the recent advances in face PAD have significantly reduced the success rate of such attacks. In this article, an empirical study on a novel and effective face impostor PA is made. In the proposed PA, a facial artifact is created by using the most vulnerable facial components, which are optimally selected based on the vulnerability analysis of different facial components to impostor PAs. An attacker can launch a face PA by presenting a facial artifact on his or her own real face. With a collected PA database containing various types of artifacts and presentation attack instruments (PAIs), the experimental results and analysis show that the proposed PA poses a more serious threat to face verification and PAD systems compared with the print, replay, and mask PAs. Moreover, the generalization ability of the proposed PA and the vulnerability analysis with regard to commercial systems are also investigated by evaluating unknown face verification and real-world PAD systems. It provides a new paradigm for the study of face PAs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491199;;;Systems AND Control
Requirements for data-driven reliability modeling and simulation of smart manufacturing systems;;;['Jonas Friederich', 'Sune Chung Jepsen', 'Sanja Lazarova-Molnar', 'Torben Worm'];;;December 2021;;;WSC '21: Proceedings of the Winter Simulation Conference;;;Planning and deploying reliable Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMSs) is of increasing interest to both scholars and practitioners. High system reliability goes hand in hand with reduced maintenance costs and enables optimized repairs and replacements. To leverage the full potential of SMSs and enable data-driven reliability assessment, data needs should be precisely defined. System integration is a key concept of the Industry 4.0 initiative and it can aid the extraction of the needed data. In this paper, we study the data requirements for a novel middleware for SMSs to enable and support data-driven reliability assessment. We present this middleware architecture and demonstrate its application through a case study, which is used to generate exemplary data that corresponds to the derived requirements. The data requirements and the middleware architecture can support researchers in developing novel data-driven reliability assessment methods, as well as assist practitioners in designing and deploying SMSs in companies.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3522802.3522841;;;Systems AND Control
Bug Localization in Model-Based Systems in the Wild;;;['Lorena Arcega', 'Jaime Font', 'Øystein Haugen', 'Carlos Cetina'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology;;;The companies that have adopted the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm have the advantage of working at a high level of abstraction. Nevertheless, they have the disadvantage of the lack of tools available to perform bug localization at the model level. In addition, in an MDE context, a bug can be related to different MDE artefacts, such as design-time models, model transformations, or run-time models. Starting the bug localization in the wrong place or with the wrong tool can lead to a result that is unsatisfactory. We evaluate how to apply the existing model-based approaches in order to mitigate the effect of starting the localization in the wrong place. We also take into account that software engineers can refine the results at different stages. In our evaluation, we compare different combinations of the application of bug localization approaches and human refinement. The combination of our approaches plus manual refinement obtains the best results. We performed a statistical analysis to provide evidence of the significance of the results. The conclusions obtained from this evaluation are: humans have to be involved at the right time in the process (or results can even get worse), and artefact-independence can be achieved without worsening the results.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472616;;;Systems AND Control

Specifically, we examine how the seemingly “positive” ideal to make technology “useful” – i.e. to build systems and devices that advance social and technological progress – masks various forms of violence and injustice such as colonial othering, racist exclusions, and exploitation. Drawing from ethnographic research, we show how design and computing methods from design thinking to agile theory and entrepreneurial approaches in tech production and higher education are the latest techniques in the cultivation of useful bodies on behalf of the state, the corporation, the university, and the economy. Aligning with feminist, critical race and critical computing commitments, this paper offers a genealogical approach to show how injustice and violence endure, despite and because of a narrative of progress and positive change.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445237;;;Systems AND Control
A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Based Approach for Anomaly Detection Systems in SDNs;;;['Mahmoud Abdallah', 'Nhien An Le Khac', 'Hamed Jahromi', 'Anca Delia Jurcut'];;;August 2021;;;ARES '21: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security;;;Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising technology for the future Internet. However, the SDN paradigm introduces new attack vectors that do not exist in the conventional distributed networks. This paper develops a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) by combining the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM). The proposed model is capable of capturing the spatial and temporal features of the network traffic. Two regularization techniques i.e., L2 Regularization () and dropout method are used to overcome with the overfitting problem. The proposed method improves the intrusion detection performance of zero-day attacks. The InSDN dataset — the most recent dataset for SDN networks is used to test and evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results indicate that integrating the CNN with LSTM improves the intrusion detection performance and achieves an accuracy of 96.32%. The estimated accuracy is higher than the accuracy of each individual model. In addition, it is established that the regularization techniques improves the performance of the CNN algorithms in detecting new intrusions when compared to the standard CNN. The findings of this study facilitates the development of robust IDS systems for SDN environment.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465481.3469190;;;Systems AND Control
Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-Offs and Accountability in Distributed ML Systems;;;['A. Feder Cooper', 'Karen Levy', 'Christopher De Sa'];;;October 2021;;;EAAMO '21: Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization;;;Trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency pervade law, public health, and other non-computing domains, which have developed policies to guide how to balance the two in conditions of uncertainty. While computer science also commonly studies accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, their policy implications remain poorly examined. Drawing on risk assessment practices in the US, we argue that, since examining these trade-offs has been useful for guiding governance in other domains, we need to similarly reckon with these trade-offs in governing computer systems. We focus our analysis on distributed machine learning systems. Understanding the policy implications in this area is particularly urgent because such systems, which include autonomous vehicles, tend to be high-stakes and safety-critical. We 1) describe how the trade-off takes shape for these systems, 2) highlight gaps between existing US risk assessment standards and what these systems require to be properly assessed, and 3) make specific calls to action to facilitate accountability when hypothetical risks concerning the accuracy-efficiency trade-off become realized as accidents in the real world. We close by discussing how such accountability mechanisms encourage more just, transparent governance aligned with public values.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465416.3483289;;;Systems AND Control
Scalable Privacy-preserving Geo-distance Evaluation for Precision Agriculture IoT Systems;;;['Qiben Yan', 'Jianzhi Lou', 'Mehmet C.

Such complexity might lead to design system architectures that are not feasible in practice or do not fulfil the requirements. Moreover, the lack of automation to assess high-level designs reduce the benefits of the early design phases by missing more suitable designs and increasing the design time.  In this paper we discuss potential research directions and propose a potential framework that aims to i) drive the engineers in the different design steps ii) capture the feasible system architectures regarding the requirements and constraints, iii) refine and assess selected architectures through simulations.

This paper addresses the problem of reducing subscription latency in reliable publish-subscribe systems. In most systems that offer reliability guarantees, a subscriber needs to wait until its subscription has been propagated throughout the entire system, and known by all relevant publishers, before starting to receive events. Interestingly, this may happen even when a previously deployed subscription covers a new one. In this paper, we study the properties that need to be satisfied to reduce the subscription latency and propose a new publish-subscribe system that leverages causal order multicast to offer low subscription latency when these conditions are met.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3441900;;;Systems AND Control

In turn, frustration levels decreased. Fabricated input worked equally well in a game story context that provided an emotional stake in the protagonist's success and a simpler task lacking such incentives.

Learning dynamical systems using a novel multiple-output Gaussian process model;;;['Shengbing Tang', 'Kenji Fujimoto', 'Ichiro Maruta'];;;March 2022;;;ICMLT '22: Proceedings of the 2022 7th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies;;;The Gaussian process (GP) has been widely used to learn the dynamical system from training data. Current methods ignore the dependencies among the multiple dimensions of the system function and model each dimension of the system function using an independent single-output GP. This paper proposes a novel multiple-output Gaussian process model to learn the dynamical system. We assume that ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with unknown physical parameters are available as prior information. The system function is modeled by a GP with the mean function given by the one-step integration of ODEs. By this way, all dimensions of the system function are correlated because they share the same unknown physical parameters. This correlation allows the flow of information between multiple dimensions of the system function which in turn will lead to an improved model. With the existing models as baselines, we show the benefits of the proposed model by simulations.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3529399.3529440;;;Systems AND Control
Performance Evaluation of Container-Level Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection Systems for Multi-Tenant Applications Using Machine Learning Algorithms;;;['Marcos Cavalcanti', 'Pedro Inacio', 'Mario Freire'];;;August 2021;;;ARES '21: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security;;;The virtualization of computing resources provided by containers has gained increasing attention and has been widely used in cloud computing. This new demand for container technology has been growing and the use of Docker and Kubernetes is considerable. According to recent technology surveys, containers are now mainstream. However, currently, one of the major challenges rises from the fact that multiple containers, with different owners, may cohabit on the same host. In container-based multi-tenant environments, security issues are of major concern. In this paper we investigate the performance of container-level anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for multi-tenant applications. We investigate the use of Bag of System Calls (BoSC) technique and the sliding window with the classifier and we consider eight machine learning algorithms for classification purposes. We show that among the eight machine learning algorithms, the best classification results are obtained with Decision Tree and Random Forest which lead to an F-Measure of 99.8%, using a sliding window with a size of 30 and the BoSC algorithm in both cases. We also show that, although both Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms leads to the best classification results, the Decision Tree algorithm has a shorter execution time and consumes less CPU and memory than the Random Forest.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465481.3470066;;;Systems AND Control
Charon: A Framework for Microservice Overload Control;;;['Jiali Xing', 'Henri Maxime Demoulin', 'Konstantinos Kallas', 'Benjamin C.

As these applications grow increasingly complex, designing efficient overload control schemes at scale is tedious. In this paper we argue part of the challenge is a lack of first principles mechanisms one can use to design scalable and verifiable policies. We present Charon, a market-based scheme for large scale service graphs. Unsurprisingly, Charon relies on tokens to negotiate the acquisition of compute resources. However, unlike existing receiver-driven systems, Charon decouples the mechanisms used to generate and value tokens and proposes efficient price propagation mechanisms. We motivate Charon with a set of representative system conditions that existing frameworks cannot handle well, detail an example policy one can build using the proposed mechanisms, and discuss open research challenges our framework exposes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3484266.3487378;;;Systems AND Control
Towards Content Provider Aware Recommender Systems: A Simulation Study on the Interplay between User and Provider Utilities;;;['Ruohan Zhan', 'Konstantina Christakopoulou', 'Ya Le', 'Jayden Ooi', 'Martin Mladenov', 'Alex Beutel', 'Craig Boutilier', 'Ed Chi', 'Minmin Chen'];;;April 2021;;;WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021;;;Most existing recommender systems focus primarily on matching users (content consumers) to content which maximizes user satisfaction on the platform. It is increasingly obvious, however, that content providers have a critical influence on user satisfaction through content creation, largely determining the content pool available for recommendation. A natural question thus arises: can we design recommenders taking into account the long-term utility of both users and content providers? By doing so, we hope to sustain more content providers and a more diverse content pool for long-term user satisfaction. Understanding the full impact of recommendations on both user and content provider groups is challenging. This paper aims to serve as a research investigation of one approach toward building a content provider aware recommender, and evaluating its impact in a simulated setup.  To characterize the user-recommender-provider interdependence, we complement user modeling by formalizing provider dynamics as well. The resulting joint dynamical system gives rise to a weakly-coupled partially observable Markov decision process driven by recommender actions and user feedback to providers. We then build a REINFORCE recommender agent, coined EcoAgent, to optimize a joint objective of user utility and the counterfactual utility lift of the content provider associated with the recommended content, which we show to be equivalent to maximizing overall user utility and the utilities of all content providers on the platform under some mild assumptions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a simulation environment capturing the key interactions among users, providers, and the recommender. We offer a number of simulated experiments that shed light on both the benefits and the limitations of our approach. These results help understand how and when a content provider aware recommender agent is of benefit in building multi-stakeholder recommender systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3449889;;;Systems AND Control
Energy-aware scheduling of multi-version tasks on heterogeneous real-time systems;;;['Julius Roeder', 'Benjamin Rouxel', 'Sebastian Altmeyer', 'Clemens Grelck'];;;March 2021;;;SAC '21: Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;The emergence of battery-powered devices has led to an increase of interest in the energy consumption of computing devices. For embedded systems, dispatching the workload on different computing units enables the optimisation of the overall energy consumption on high-performance heterogeneous platforms. However, to use the full power of heterogeneity, architecture specific binary blocks are required, each with different energy/time trade-offs. Finding a scheduling strategy that minimises the energy consumption, while guaranteeing timing constraints creates new challenges. These challenges can only be met by using the full heterogeneous capacity of the platform (e.g. heterogeneous CPU, GPU, DVFS, dynamic frequency changes from within an application). We propose an off-line scheduling algorithm for dependent multiversion tasks based on Forward List Scheduling to minimise the overall energy consumption. Our heuristic accounts for Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and enables applications to dynamically adapt voltage and frequency during run time. We demonstrate the benefits of multi-version task models coupled with an energy-aware scheduler. We observe that selecting the most energy efficient version for each task does not lead to the lowest energy consumption for the whole application. Then we show that our approach produces schedules that are on average 45.6% more energy efficient than schedules produced by a state-of-the-art scheduling algorithm. Next we compare our heuristic against an optimal solution derived by an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation (deviation of 1.6% on average). Lastly, we empirically show that the energy consumption predicted by our scheduler is close to the actual measured energy consumption on a Odroid-XU4 board (at most-15.8%).;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3441930;;;Systems AND Control

We introduce new attacks specific to this domain with size constraints that minimize attack costs. We further discuss how these attacks can be used as an analysis tool to study and evaluate the robustness properties of financial models.

The semantics of shared memory in Intel CPU/FPGA systems;;;['Dan Iorga', 'Alastair F. Donaldson', 'Tyler Sorensen', 'John Wickerson'];;;October 2021;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages;;;Heterogeneous CPU/FPGA devices, in which a CPU and an FPGA can execute together while sharing memory, are becoming popular in several computing sectors. In this paper, we study the shared-memory semantics of these devices, with a view to providing a firm foundation for reasoning about the programs that run on them. Our focus is on Intel platforms that combine an Intel FPGA with a multicore Xeon CPU. We describe the weak-memory behaviours that are allowed (and observable) on these devices when CPU threads and an FPGA thread access common memory locations in a fine-grained manner through multiple channels. Some of these behaviours are familiar from well-studied CPU and GPU concurrency; others are weaker still. We encode these behaviours in two formal memory models: one operational, one axiomatic. We develop executable implementations of both models, using the CBMC bounded model-checking tool for our operational model and the Alloy modelling language for our axiomatic model. Using these, we cross-check our models against each other via a translator that converts Alloy-generated executions into queries for the CBMC model. We also validate our models against actual hardware by translating 583 Alloy-generated executions into litmus tests that we run on CPU/FPGA devices; when doing this, we avoid the prohibitive cost of synthesising a hardware design per litmus test by creating our own 'litmus-test processor' in hardware. We expect that our models will be useful for low-level programmers, compiler writers, and designers of analysis tools. Indeed, as a demonstration of the utility of our work, we use our operational model to reason about a producer/consumer buffer implemented across the CPU and the FPGA. When the buffer uses insufficient synchronisation -- a situation that our model is able to detect -- we observe that its performance improves at the cost of occasional data corruption.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485497;;;Systems AND Control
On the Algorithmic Solvability of Channel Dependent Classification Problems in Communication Systems;;;['Holger Boche', 'Rafael F. Schaefer', 'H. Vincent Poor'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;For communication systems there is a recent trend towards shifting functionalities from the physical layer to higher layers by enabling software-focused solutions. Having obtained a (physical layer-based) description of the communication channel, such approaches exploit this knowledge to enable various services by subsequently processing it on higher layers. For this it is a crucial task to first find out in which state the underlying communication channel is. This paper develops a framework based on Turing machines and studies whether or not it is in principle possible to algorithmically solve such classification tasks, i.e., to decide in which state the communication system is. Turing machines have no limitations on computational complexity, computing capacity and storage, and can simulate any given algorithm and therewith are a simple but very powerful model of computation. They characterize the fundamental performance limits for today&#x2019;s digital computers. It is shown that there exists no Turing machine that takes the physical description of the communication channel as an input and solves a non-trivial classification task. Subsequently, this general result is used to study communication under adversarial attacks and it is shown that it is impossible to algorithmically detect denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the transmission. Jamming attacks on ACK/NACK feedback cannot be detected as well and, in addition, ACK/NACK feedback is shown to be useless for the detection of DoS on the actual message transmission. Further applications are discussed including DoS attacks on the Post Shannon task of identification, and on physical layer security and resilience by design.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3059920;;;Systems AND Control
Improving the Usage of Industrialized Building Systems in the South African Construction Industry: Principal Component Analysis Approach;;;['Emmanuel Oikelomen Ayorinde', 'Ntebo Ngcobo', 'Mathe Kasenge'];;;August 2021;;;ICICM '21: Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Information Communication and Management;;;The construction industry (CI) is the main driver of sustainable development (SD) and economic expansion in society. Industrialized building systems (IBS) promote productivity and improves quality on construction sites. The purpose of this study is to investigate ways of improving the use of IBS in the SACI. For this study, data was collected using primary and secondary sources of data collection. The study adopted a quantitative research approach with data gathered from the respondents within SACI. The findings revealed that the most significant ways of improving IBS use in SACI are government incentives towards IBS supporting projects, specialized training for IBS contractors, and improving the educational curriculum to include IBS methods. Construction waste is a by-product of construction demolition and renovation and has caused adverse effects on the environment. Therefore, one of the way to mitigate such environmental hazards is to use IBS. This study will contribute greatly to sustainable construction delivery in South Africa, socio-economic growth and will aid fast delivery of construction projects in terms of cost, time, and quality. Also, construction waste hazards causing harm to the environment can be reduced with the correct implementation of IBS in society.

Exploring an Opportunity to Support Local Food Systems through Online Food Delivery Services with Live-Streaming Farms in China;;;['Xiaotong Du', 'Sunyoung Kim'];;;September 2021;;;MobileHCI '21: Adjunct Publication of the 23rd International Conference on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction;;;The use of online food delivery (OFD) services has skyrocketed despite lingering concerns about food safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted most business sectors, including local farms and ranches whose channels to sell through local food markets have shut down. With the demand for food delivery is increasing while the local food market at risk, we saw an opportunity to connect these two complementary businesses through “live-streaming farms.” We conducted interviews to investigate the current challenges of using OFD services, designed and evaluated the concept of live-streaming farms in OFD services to promote sustainable local food systems. Our findings indicate that offering extra food-related information through live streaming could potentially reduce primary concerns about food safety for OFD users and build local food networks. We conclude by discussing the design considerations of live-streaming farms that can improve user experience with OFD and support the local food systems.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447527.3474859;;;Systems AND Control
Bringing Friends into the Loop of Recommender Systems: An Exploratory Study;;;['Jinghua Piao', 'Guozhen Zhang', 'Fengli Xu', 'Zhilong Chen', 'Yu Zheng', 'Chen Gao', 'Yong Li'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction;;;The recommender system (RS), as a computer-supported information filtering system, is ubiquitous and influences what we eat, watch, or even like. In online RS, interactions between users and the system form a feedback loop: users take actions based on the recommendations provided by RS, and RS updates its recommendations accordingly. As such interactions increase, the issue of recommendation homogeneity intensifies, which significantly impairs user experience. In the face of this long-standing issue, the newly-emerging social e-commerce offers a new solution -- bringing friends' recommendations into the loop (friend-in-the-loop). In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on the benefits of friend-in-the-loop through mixed methods on a leading social e-commerce platform in China, Beidian. We reveal that friend-in-the-loop provides users with more accurate and diverse recommendations than merely RS, and significantly alleviates algorithmic homogeneity. Moreover, our qualitative results demonstrate that the introduction of friends' external knowledge, consumers' trust, and empathy accounts for these benefits. Overall, we elaborate that friend-in-the-loop comprehensively benefits both users and RS, and it is a promising HCI-based solution to recommendation homogeneity, which offers insightful implications on designing future human-algorithm collaboration models.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479583;;;Systems AND Control
More Is Not Always Better: An Analytical Study of Controller Synchronizations in Distributed SDN;;;['Ziyao Zhang', 'Liang Ma', 'Kin K. Leung', 'Franck Le'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;Distributed software-defined networks (SDN), consisting of multiple inter-connected network domains, each managed by one SDN controller, is an emerging networking architecture that offers balanced centralized control and distributed operations. In such networking paradigm, most existing works focus on designing sophisticated controller-synchronization strategies to improve joint controller-decision-making for inter-domain routing. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of how the performance of distributed SDN is related to network attributes, thus impossible to justify the necessity of complicated strategies. In this regard, we analyse and quantify how the performance enhancement of distributed SDN architectures is influenced by inter-domain synchronization levels, in terms of the resulting number of abstracted routing clusters, and network structural properties. Based on a generic network model incorporating link preference for path constructions, we establish analytical lower bounds for quantifying the routing performance under any arbitrarily given network synchronization status. The significance of these performance bounds is that they can be used to quantify the contribution of controller synchronization levels in improving the network performance under different network parameters, which therefore serves as a fundamental guidance for future SDN performance analysis and protocol designs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3066580;;;Systems AND Control
Automatically authoring regression tests for machine-learning based systems;;;['Junjie Zhu', 'Teng Long', 'Atif Memon'];;;May 2021;;;ICSE-SEIP '21: Proceedings of the 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice;;;Two key design characteristics of machine learning (ML) systems---their ever-improving nature, and learning-based emergent functional behavior---create a moving target, posing new challenges for authoring/maintaining functional regression tests. We identify four specific challenges and address them by developing a new general methodology to automatically author and maintain tests. In particular, we use the volume of production data to periodically refresh our large corpus of test inputs and expected outputs; we use perturbation of the data to obtain coverage-adequate tests; and we use clustering to help identify patterns of failures that are indicative of software bugs. We demonstrate our methodology on an ML-based context-aware Speller. Our coverage-adequate, approx. 1 million regression test cases, automatically authored and maintained for Speller (1) are virtually maintenance free, (2) detect a higher number of Speller failures than previous manually-curated tests, (3) have better coverage of previously unknown functional boundaries of the ML component, and (4) lend themselves to automatic failure triaging by clustering and prioritizing subcategories of tests with over-represented failures. We identify several systematic failure patterns which were due to previously undetected bugs in the Speller, e.g., (1) when the user misses the first letter in a short word, and (2) when the user mistakenly inserts a character in the last token of an address; these have since been fixed.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICSE-SEIP52600.2021.00049;;;Systems AND Control
Noise and Codification Effect on Emotional Speech Classification Systems;;;['Fangfang Zhu-Zhou', 'Roberto Gil-Pita', 'Joaquín García-Gómez', 'Manuel Rosa-Zurera'];;;December 2021;;;WI-IAT '21: IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology;;;Emotions are reactions that all human beings experience daily, e.g., joy, sadness, fear, anger. They can be manifested through speech: when we speak, words are always accompanied by our emotions. This fact affects the muscular movements of the respiratory system and the larynx, thus modifying the timbre, tone, intensity, and intonation of what we say.  There are many acoustic databases labeled with emotions available in the public domain. However, most of them were created under non-real-world circumstances, i.e., actors recreated emotions, and emotions were labeled under fictitious conditions where noise is absent. Another drawback of the design of emotion recognition systems is the lack of enough patterns in the available databases, thus driving to generalization problems and leading to overfitting. In this paper, a system is developed in order to verify the noise and the codification effect. Results have shown a performance deterioration in both cases, increasing the error probability from 28.54% to 65.29% in the first case and from 28.54% to 40.09% in the second case. Furthermore, an enlargement of the training set is proposed, creating new virtual patterns consisting of the original patterns with the addition of different values of signal-to-noise ratio and its effect in the design of an emotion classification system, confirming an improvement of the test error probability.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498851.3499022;;;Systems AND Control

However, it is challenging to understand, maintain, and evolve feature fragments guarded by #ifdef directives. Yet, despite HCSSs being implemented in Version Control Systems, the support for evolving features in space and time is still limited. To extend the knowledge on this topic, we analyze the feature life cycle in space and time. Specifically, we introduce an automated mining approach and apply it to four HCSSs, analyzing commits of their entire development life cycle (13 to 20 years and 37,500 commits). This goes beyond existing studies, which investigated only differences between specific releases or entire systems. Our results show that features undergo frequent changes, often with substantial modifications of their code. The findings of our empirical analyses stress the need for better support of system evolution in space and time at the level of features. In addition to these analyses, we contribute an automated mining approach for the analysis of system evolution at the level of features. Furthermore, we also make available our dataset to foster new studies on feature evolution in HCSSs.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486609.3487195;;;Systems AND Control
Faster One Block Quantifier Elimination for Regular Polynomial Systems of Equations;;;['Huu Phuoc Le', 'Mohab Safey El Din'];;;July 2021;;;ISSAC '21: Proceedings of the 2021 on International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation;;;Quantifier elimination over the reals is a central problem in computational real algebraic geometry, polynomial system solving and symbolic computation. Given a semi-algebraic formula (whose atoms are polynomial constraints) with quantifiers on some variables, it consists in computing a logically equivalent formula involving only unquantified variables. When there is no alternation of quantifiers, one has a one block quantifier elimination problem. This paper studies a variant of the one block quantifier elimination in which we compute an almost equivalent formula of the input. We design a new probabilistic efficient algorithm for solving this variant when the input is a system of polynomial equations satisfying some regularity assumptions. When the input is generic, involves s polynomials of degree bounded by D with n quantified variables and t unquantified ones, we prove that this algorithm outputs semi-algebraic formulas of degree bounded by D using O((n-s+1) 8t D 3t+2(t+D t) arithmetic operations in the ground field where D = 2(n+s) Ds(D-1)n-s+1(ns.

A Graph-Assisted Out-of-Place Update Scheme for Erasure Coded Storage Systems;;;['Haiwei Deng', 'Ranhao Jia', 'Chentao Wu'];;;August 2021;;;ICPP '21: Proceedings of the 50th International Conference on Parallel Processing;;;Erasure Codes (ECs) have widely been used in distributed storage systems to ensure data availability because of its low storage cost and high reliability. However, the update operations in erasure coded storage systems can bring extremely high I/O latency and load imbalance due to the complexity of relationships between data and parity blocks. Although several methods such as Parity Logging (PL) and Log-Structured Array (LSA) have been proposed to improve the performance of updates, they either bring extra I/O operations or decrease the performance of file access.  To address the above problems, we propose a novel Graph-assisted Out-of-place Update (GOOD) scheme to improve the performance of the update, which avoids extra I/O operations and maintains the parallelism of the file access. The key idea of GOOD is to write the updated blocks into new places while maintaining blocks of the same file distribute among different nodes. The update and garbage collection processes are guided by the graphs constructed in advance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GOOD, we conduct several experiments in a Hadoop cluster. The results show that GOOD reduces the average response time by up to 55.33% and number of I/O operations by up to 20.28% compared to the existing methods.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3472456.3472502;;;Systems AND Control

For a health recommender system to personalize interventions, the interventions should be properly designed, and the behavior change aspects should be adequately integrated into the recommendation process. This paper demonstrates an implementation guideline derived from a practical approach in integrating behavior change theories and persuasive design principles into an example mobile-based health recommender system for mental health promotion. This implementation maps a set of relevant theories for designing the health recommender system into a set of requirements using a functional framework. By realizing these requirements, one can assure that the behavior change theories are at the very least considered. This effort serves as a guideline for future implementations and highlights elements that could perhaps be used for other health or recommendation domains and, particularly, user integration purposes.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460418.3479330;;;Systems AND Control

A programming environment for multi-FPGA systems based on CyberWorkBench: an integrated design tool;;;['Hiroaki Suzuki', 'Wataru Takahashi', 'Kazutoshi Wakabayashi', 'Hideharu Amano'];;;June 2021;;;HEART '21: Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies;;;This paper proposes a multi-FPGA programming environment based on NEC's integrated design tool CyberWorkBench (CWB) for a multi-FPGA system FiC (Flow-in-Cloud). Programmers describe their program in SystemC as small modules connected with FIFO channels, then verify the operation with the behavioral simulation considering parallel execution. After the high-level synthesis (HLS) is done with CWB, modules distributed to each board are decided, and the interface module is inserted. The cycle accurate simulation is applied to ensure the operation and estimate the performance. Finally, generated Verilog HDL code for each board is implemented with Xilinx's Vivado just like the traditional design and configuration is obtained. As an example, a simple convolutional neural network LeNet is described and implemented on a real system using the tool. Although the cycle accurate simulation takes 105.34sec, the estimated cycles are only 2.2% difference from the real boards execution result. Since the example CNN LeNet is too small, it can be implemented into a single board with a traditional design tool. However, considering the pipeline execution, parallel execution with two boards can distribute the input and output into different FPGAs, and relax the bottleneck.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468044.3468049;;;Systems AND Control
Unifying AoI Minimization and Remote Estimation&#x2014;Optimal Sensor/Controller Coordination With Random Two-Way Delay;;;['Cho-Hsin Tsai', 'Chih-Chun Wang'];;;None;;;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;;;The ubiquitous usage of communication networks in modern sensing and control applications has kindled new interests on the timing coordination between sensors and controllers, i.e., how to use the &#x201C;waiting time&#x201D; to improve the system performance. Contrary to the common belief that a zero-wait policy is optimal, Sun <italic>et al.</italic> showed that a controller can strictly improve the data freshness, the so-called Age-of-Information (AoI), by postponing transmission in order to lengthen the duration of staying in a good state. The optimal waiting policy for the <italic>sensor</italic> side was later characterized in the context of remote estimation. Instead of focusing on the sensor and controller sides separately, this work develops the jointly optimal sensor/controller waiting policy in a Wiener-process system. This work generalizes the above two important results in the sense that not only do we consider joint sensor/controller designs (as opposed to sensor-only or controller-only schemes), but we also assume random delay in both the forward and feedback directions (as opposed to random delay in only one direction). In addition to provable optimality, extensive simulation is used to verify the performance of the proposed scheme.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2021.3111495;;;Systems AND Control
An Intelligent Human Avatar to Debug and Challenge Human-aware Robot Navigation Systems;;;['Anthony Favier', 'Phani Teja Singamaneni', 'Rachid Alami'];;;March 2022;;;HRI '22: Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction;;;Experimenting, testing, and debugging robot social navigation systems is a challenging task. While simulation is generally well suited for a first level of debugging and evaluation of robotics controllers and planners, the social navigation field lacks satisfactory simulators of humans which act, react and interact rationally and naturally. To facilitate the development of human-aware navigation systems, we propose a system to simulate an autonomous human agent that is both reactive and rational, specifically designed to act and interact with a robot for navigation problems and potential conflicts. Besides, it also provides some metrics to partially evaluate such interactions and data logs for further analysis. We show the limitations of over-used reactive-only approaches. Then, thanks to two different human-aware navigation planners, we show how our system can help answer the lack of intelligent human avatars for tuning and debugging social navigation systems before their final evaluation with real humans.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3523760.3523871;;;Systems AND Control

We look at the area of data collection in low-resource settings among rural women in North India, and explore the feasibility of using voice-based surveys conducted through IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems where users may speak their responses in a conversational manner through natural speech. Through an iterative design process and detailed user feedback, we describe several nuances in running voice-based surveys, and compare their accuracy of data collection through equivalent keypress-based surveys. We find strong user preferences for voice-based surveys, and comparable performance with keypress-based surveys for most types of questions. Our results suggest that voice-based conversational interfaces may hold significant potential to build interactive applications for low-income and less-literate populations.

Towards a behavioral description of cyber-physical systems using the thing description;;;['Fady Salama', 'Ege Korkan', 'Sebastian Käbisch', 'Sebastian Steinhorst'];;;December 2021;;;DAI-SNAC '21: Proceedings of the 2021 Workshop on Descriptive Approaches to IoT Security, Network, and Application Configuration;;;The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) introduced the Thing Description (TD), a standardized and unified human- and machine-readable semantic description of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that focuses on describing how to interact with the described device using its network-interfaces. However, the TDs lack a way to describe the physical effect of said interactions on the device itself, as well as on the environment around the device, limiting its viability for cyber-physical scenarios. In this paper, we propose an extension for describing the effects of an interaction on the property affordances of a Thing in the TD as a first step towards a TD that is able to fully describe a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). We show this extension permits the generation of accurate Digital Twins, facilitates machine-aided system design and device mashup generation and allows for formal verification of the functionality of CPSs during their deployment and maintenance.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488661.3494030;;;Systems AND Control
Increasing Player Performance and Game Experience in High Latency Systems;;;['David Halbhuber', 'Niels Henze', 'Valentin Schwind'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction;;;Cloud gaming services and remote play offer a wide range of advantages but can inherent a considerable delay between input and action also known as latency. Previous work indicates that deep learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANN) are able to compensate for latency. As high latency in video games significantly reduces player performance and game experience, this work investigates if latency can be compensated using ANNs within a live first-person action game. We developed a 3D video game and coupled it with the prediction of an ANN. We trained our network on data of 24 participants who played the game in a first study. We evaluated our system in a second user study with 96 participants. To simulate latency in cloud game streaming services, we added 180 ms latency to the game by buffering user inputs. In the study we predicted latency values of 60 ms, 120 ms and 180 ms. Our results show that players achieve significantly higher scores, substantially more hits per shot and associate the game significantly stronger with a positive affect when supported by our ANN. This work illustrates that high latency systems, such as game streaming services, benefit from utilizing a predictive system.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474710;;;Systems AND Control

However, their design involves a variety of choices. Some of these choices influence the results that will be obtained, and thus the conclusions that can be drawn; others influence the impacts---both beneficial and harmful---that a disaggregated evaluation will have on people, including the people whose data is used to conduct the evaluation. We argue that a deeper understanding of these choices will enable researchers and practitioners to design careful and conclusive disaggregated evaluations. We also argue that better documentation of these choices, along with the underlying considerations and tradeoffs that have been made, will help others when interpreting an evaluation's results and conclusions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462610;;;Systems AND Control

Comprehensive Systems: A formal foundation for Multi-Model Consistency Management;;;['Patrick Stünkel', 'Harald König', 'Yngve Lamo', 'Adrian Rutle'];;;None;;;Formal Aspects of Computing;;;AbstractModel management is a central activity in Software Engineering. The most challenging aspect of model management is to keep inter-related models consistent with each other while they evolve. As a consequence, there is a lot of scientific activity in this area, which has produced an extensive body of knowledge, methods, results and tools. The majority of these approaches, however, are limited to binary inter-model relations; i.e. the synchronisation of exactly two models. Yet, not every multi-ary relation can be factored into a family of  binary relations. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel comprehensive system construction, which is able to represent multi-ary relations among multiple models in an integrated manner and thus serves as a formal
 foundation for artefacts used in consistency management activities involving multiple models. The construction is based on the definition of partial commonalities among a set of models using the same language, which is used to denote the (local) models. The main theoretical results of this paper are proofs of the facts that comprehensive systems are an admissible environment for (i) applying formal means of consistency verification (diagrammatic predicate framework), (ii) performing algebraic graph transformation (weak adhesive HLR category), and (iii) that they generalise the underlying setting of graph diagrams and triple graph grammars.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00165-021-00555-2;;;Systems AND Control

While researchers have described a number of case studies on various TDSs or the businesses they serve, we still lack an understanding of how users are differentiated in these ecosystems, how different illicit activities frequently leverage the same advertisement networks and, subsequently, the same malicious advertisers. We design ODIN (Observatory of Dynamic Illicit ad Networks), the first system to study cloaking, user differentiation and business integration at the same time in four different types of traffic sources: typosquatting, copyright-infringing movie streaming, ad-based URL shortening, and illicit online pharmacy websites.  ODIN performed 874,494 scrapes over two months (June 19, 2019–August 24, 2019), posing as six different types of users (e.g., mobile, desktop, and crawler) and accumulating over 2TB of data. We observed 81% more malicious pages compared to using only the best performing crawl profile by itself. Three of the traffic sources we study redirect users to the same traffic broker domain names up to 44% of the time and all of them often expose users to the same malicious advertisers. Our experiments show that novel cloaking techniques could decrease by half the number of malicious pages observed. Worryingly, popular blacklists do not just suffer from the lack of coverage and delayed detection, but miss the vast majority of malicious pages targeting mobile users. We use these findings to design a classifier, which can make precise predictions about the likelihood of a user being redirected to a malicious advertiser.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450071;;;Systems AND Control
QoS-aware dynamic controller implantation over vSDN-enabled UAV networks for real-time service delivery;;;['Deborsi Basu', 'Abhishek Jain', 'Uttam Ghosh', 'Raja Datta'];;;October 2021;;;DroneCom '21: Proceedings of the 4th ACM MobiCom Workshop on Drone Assisted Wireless Communications for 5G and Beyond;;;The advancement of wireless communication networks has been highly influenced by the development of UAV networks. The real-time realization and quick installation of UAV networks make it extremely suitable for emergency services. Due to limited energy and processing memory, vSDN-enabled UAV networks are brought into the picture where the central SDN controller is used to manage the Data Plane UAV activities. The placement of the controller is a critical issue due to random mobility and distant coverage. In this work, we have proposed a controller implantation technique for low latency communication and service delivery. A two-tier hierarchical data plane (D-plane) segmentation has been introduced to place the UAV entities at D-plane. Our algorithmic approach shows that the centralization of SDN controller causes comparatively low latency with respect to other potential regions. We have relaxed the traffic overheads considering minimal data exchange between D-plane and C-plane. The latency trade-off significantly helps to identify the most suitable positions to deploy the Controller units. This work also contributes towards the CPP-UAV (Controller Placement Problem in UAV-networks).;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477090.3481055;;;Systems AND Control

Review Summary Generation in Online Systems: Frameworks for Supervised and Unsupervised Scenarios;;;['Wenjun Jiang', 'Jing Chen', 'Xiaofei Ding', 'Jie Wu', 'Jiawei He', 'Guojun Wang'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on the Web;;;In online systems, including e-commerce platforms, many users resort to the reviews or comments generated by previous consumers for decision making, while their time is limited to deal with many reviews. Therefore, a review summary, which contains all important features in user-generated reviews, is expected. In this article, we study “how to generate a comprehensive review summary from a large number of user-generated reviews.” This can be implemented by text summarization, which mainly has two types of extractive and abstractive approaches. Both of these approaches can deal with both supervised and unsupervised scenarios, but the former may generate redundant and incoherent summaries, while the latter can avoid redundancy but usually can only deal with short sequences. Moreover, both approaches may neglect the sentiment information. To address the above issues, we propose comprehensive Review Summary Generation frameworks to deal with the supervised and unsupervised scenarios. We design two different preprocess models of re-ranking and selecting to identify the important sentences while keeping users’ sentiment in the original reviews. These sentences can be further used to generate review summaries with text summarization methods. Experimental results in seven real-world datasets (Idebate, Rotten Tomatoes Amazon, Yelp, and three unlabelled product review datasets in Amazon) demonstrate that our work performs well in review summary generation. Moreover, the re-ranking and selecting models show different characteristics.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448015;;;Systems AND Control
Understanding the Effects of Structured Note-taking Systems for Video-based Learners in Individual and Social Learning Contexts;;;['Jingchao Fang', 'Yanhao Wang', 'Chi-Lan Yang', 'Ching Liu', 'Hao-Chuan Wang'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction;;;Video-based learning is widely adopted by online learners, yet, learning experience and quality may be negatively affected by asynchronous and remote natures of video-based learning. As note-taking is a common practice employed by video-based learners and is known to be an effective way to trigger active construction and processing of knowledge, yet as a meta-skill, it is challenging to most learners. In this study, we aim to approach the goal of providing cognitive and social scaffolds to video-based learners by structuring their note-taking process. We presented and evaluated structured note-taking systems designed for learners in two contexts, namely, individual learning context and social learning context. With an online controlled study involving 43 participants, we compared the structured note-taking systems with two baseline systems (for individual learning and social learning contexts respectively) and found that structured note-taking significantly improved certain aspects of video-based learning such as and higher cognitive engagement and lower distraction.

Mean Field and Refined Mean Field Approximations for Heterogeneous Systems: It Works!;;;['Sebastian Allmeier', 'Nicolas Gast'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems;;;Mean field approximation is a powerful technique to study the performance of large stochastic systems represented as n interacting objects. Applications include load balancing models, epidemic spreading, cache replacement policies, or large-scale data centers. Mean field approximation is asymptotically exact for systems composed of n homogeneous objects under mild conditions. In this paper, we study what happens when objects are heterogeneous. This can represent servers with different speeds or contents with different popularities. We define an interaction model that allows obtaining asymptotic convergence results for stochastic systems with heterogeneous object behavior, and show that the error of the mean field approximation is of order $O(1/n)$. More importantly, we show how to adapt the refined mean field approximation, developed by Gast et al., and show that the error of this approximation is reduced to O(1/n^2). To illustrate the applicability of our result, we present two examples. The first addresses a list-based cache replacement model, RANDOM(m), which is an extension of the RANDOM policy. The second is a heterogeneous supermarket model. These examples show that the proposed approximations are computationally tractable and very accurate. They also show that for moderate system sizes (30) the refined mean field approximation tends to be more accurate than simulations for any reasonable simulation time.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508033;;;Systems AND Control
Riso-Tree: An Efficient and Scalable Index for Spatial Entities in Graph Database Management Systems;;;['Yuhan Sun', 'Mohamed Sarwat'];;;None;;;ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems;;;With the ubiquity of spatial data, vertexes or edges in graphs can possess spatial location attributes side by side with other non-spatial attributes. For instance, as of June 2018, the Wikidata knowledge graph contains 48,547,142 data items (i.e., vertexes) and \(\)13% of them have spatial location attributes. The article proposes Riso-Tree, a generic efficient and scalable indexing framework for spatial entities in graph database management systems. Riso-Tree enables the fast execution of graph queries that involve different types of spatial predicates (GraSp queries). The proposed framework augments the classic R-Tree structure with pre-materialized sub-graph entries. The pruning power of R-Tree is enhanced with the sub-graph information. Riso-Tree partitions the graph into sub-graphs based on their connectivity to the spatial sub-regions. The proposed index allows for the fast execution of GraSp queries by efficiently pruning the traversed vertexes/edges based upon the materialized sub-graph information. The experiments show that the proposed Riso-Tree achieves up to two orders of magnitude faster execution time than its counterparts when executing GraSp queries on real graphs (e.g., Wikidata). The strategy of limiting the size of each sub-graph entry (PNmax) is proposed to reduce the storage overhead of Riso-Tree. The strategy can save up to around 70% storage without harming the query performance according to the experiments. Another strategy is proposed to ensure the performance of the index maintenance (Irrelevant Vertexes Skipping). The experiments show that the strategy can improve performance, especially for slow updates. It proves that Riso-Tree is useful for applications that need to support frequent updates.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450945;;;Systems AND Control
Robust and budget-constrained encoding configurations for in-memory database systems;;;['Martin Boissier'];;;None;;;Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment;;;Data encoding has been applied to database systems for decades as it mitigates bandwidth bottlenecks and reduces storage requirements. But even in the presence of these advantages, most in-memory database systems use data encoding only conservatively as the negative impact on runtime performance can be severe. Real-world systems with large parts being infrequently accessed and cost efficiency constraints in cloud environments require solutions that automatically and efficiently select encoding techniques, including heavy-weight compression. In this paper, we introduce workload-driven approaches to automaticaly determine memory budget-constrained encoding configurations using greedy heuristics and linear programming. We show for TPC-H, TPC-DS, and the Join Order Benchmark that optimized encoding configurations can reduce the main memory footprint significantly without a loss in runtime performance over state-of-the-art dictionary encoding. To yield robust selections, we extend the linear programming-based approach to incorporate query runtime constraints and mitigate unexpected performance regressions.;;;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3503585.3503588;;;Systems AND Control
A Methodology for Simulating Multi-chiplet Systems Using Open-source Simulators;;;['Haocong Zhi', 'Xianuo Xu', 'Weijian Han', 'Zhilin Gao', 'Xiaohang Wang', 'Maurizio Palesi', 'Amit Kumar Singh', 'Letian Huang'];;;September 2021;;;NANOCOM '21: Proceedings of the Eight Annual ACM International Conference on Nanoscale Computing and Communication;;;Multi-chiplet systems are a new design paradigm to mitigate the chip design cost and improve yield for complex SoCs. The design space of multi-chiplet systems is much larger compared to a single chip SoC system. To support early stage design space exploration, simulators are of paramount importance. However, existing open-source multi-/many-core simulators are not suitable for simulating large-scale multi-chiplet systems due to the following reasons: 1) lack of accurate inter-chiplet interconnection model, and 2) incapable of supporting large-scale parallel simulation with accurate interconnection modelling. Therefore, we propose a methodology for building up a simulator for multi-chiplet systems using open-source simulators like gem5, sniper, gpgpu-sim, etc. This simulation methodology mimics the reuse and integration idea of chiplets, that is, these existing open-source simulators are reused to simulate individual chiplets, and an inter-simulator-process communication and synchronization protocol is proposed to simulate inter-chiplet communication. The proposed simulation methodology has the following features: 1) Parallel simulation for large-scale systems is supported with inter- and intra-chiplet interconnection accurately modelled. 2) Both distributed and shared memory models are supported for multi-chiplet systems. We also provide a method to modify the code of the open-source simulators like gem5, sniper, gpgpu-sim, etc. for multi-chiplet simulation, and we have released the source code of multi-chiplet simulators based on gem5, sniper, gpgpu-sim at https://github.com/FCAS-SCUT/chiplet_simulators.
