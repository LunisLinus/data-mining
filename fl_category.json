        "abstract": "CCTV cameras installed for continuous surveillance generate enormous amounts of data daily, forging the term Big Video Data (BVD). The active practice of BVD includes intelligent surveillance and activity recognition, among other challenging tasks. To efficiently address these tasks, the computer vision research community has provided monitoring systems, activity recognition methods, and many other computationally complex solutions for the purposeful usage of BVD. Unfortunately, the limited capabilities of these methods, higher computational complexity, and stringent installation requirements hinder their practical implementation in real-world scenarios, which still demand human operators sitting in front of cameras to monitor activities or make actionable decisions based on BVD. The usage of human-like logic, known as fuzzy logic, has been employed emerging for various data science applications such as control systems, image processing, decision making, routing, and advanced safety-critical systems. This is due to its ability to handle various sources of real-world domain and data uncertainties, generating easily adaptable and explainable data-based models. Fuzzy logic can be effectively used for surveillance as a complementary for huge-sized artificial intelligence models and tiresome training procedures. In this article, we draw researchers’ attention toward the usage of fuzzy logic for surveillance in the context of BVD. We carry out a comprehensive literature survey of methods for vision sensory data analytics that resort to fuzzy logic concepts. Our overview highlights the advantages, downsides, and challenges in existing video analysis methods based on fuzzy logic for surveillance applications. We enumerate and discuss the datasets used by these methods, and finally provide an outlook toward future research directions derived from our critical assessment of the efforts invested so far in this exciting field.",

        "abstract": "Depth’ is taken to be the ‘cable depth’ by logging system that is collected at regular depth intervals. Due to the distortion of log measurement caused by cable stretch, irregular motion, and imaging logging tool sticking, serious distortion of logging image occurs, which affects the preparation and acquisition of geological information. Therefore, speed correction is needed to restore the ‘true depth’ of downhole instrument sampling data. In this paper, the motion state of the imaging logging tool is analyzed. Firstly, the Kalman filter model is constructed, and the noise variance of the Kalman filter is corrected in real-time by using a fuzzy logic controller and ‘tool sticking’ identification results, to improve the output accuracy of the system. Through the analysis of logging data, it is found that the method can eliminate the phenomenon of image compression and stretching caused by tool stuck, and restore the subtle characteristics of the formation such as fractures, pores, and bedding, which proves the effectiveness of the technology.",

The water quality standards of filtered water were used as the basis for the fuzzy logic algorithm to define the effectiveness of filtered rainwater and tap water. In getting a probability value of 0.96, it shows that there is a significant difference with the pre-filtered and post-filtered parameter values of rainwater and tap water. Based on the evaluation using fuzzy logic, it also shows that the pre-filtered water has changed into a more acceptable value after the filtration process. With the laboratory testing results to test the accuracy of the device, a probability value of 0.97 was able to calculate, which denotes no significant difference between the measured values of the device with the laboratory result.",

Breast tumor segmentation is one of the most critical and difficult tasks. In order to realize the automatic and rapid positioning of seed points and meet the needs of real-time online image segmentation, this paper presents an automatic positioning method of seed points in ultrasound breast tumor images based on fuzzy logic algorithm. The fuzzy logic is innovatively introduced into neural network, which is combined with the method of recalibrating the importance of characteristic elements in attention mechanism. By defining a reasonable fuzzy membership function, different diffusion coefficients are adopted for different pixel gradients. Automatic reference points are obtained by using the automatic reference point selection method based on texture features of image gray level co-occurrence matrix. On this basis, the seed points are iteratively obtained by Mean−Shift algorithm, which is the tumor area. Simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to most existing fuzzy closed-value segmentation methods.",

Due to the frequent use of mobile devices in daily life, the quality of service (QoS) during moving process also needs to be guaranteed. Many studies have shown that edge computing can provide users with low latency and high-quality network services, and can also be useful in mobile network scenarios due to the richness of its network architecture. In existing mobile edge computing networks, research on service migration mainly considers the impact of distance and energy consumption on the service migration process. This paper analyses the problems arising in the service migration process and the various factors affecting the quality of service migration, including the environment of migration and the mobility of users, etc. By using fuzzy logic to calculate the evaluation value of the target service migration process, the decision problem of service migration is then transformed into a Markov decision process, and service migration points are also set to improve the decision process. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified through experimental simulations..",

A fuzzy system is a strong tool for processing imprecise or ambiguous data, and it can be used for text sentiment analysis. This article proposes a new formulation of a multi-task Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK FS) modeling, which can be used for text sentiment image classification. Using a novel multi-task fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, the common (public) information among all tasks and the individual (private) information for each task are extracted. The information about clustering, for example, cluster centers, can be used to learn the antecedent parameters of multi-task TSK fuzzy systems. With the common and individual antecedent parameters obtained, a corresponding multi-task learning mechanism for learning consequent parameters is devised. Accordingly, a multi-task fuzzy clustering–based multi-task TSK fuzzy system (MTFCM-MT-TSK-FS) is proposed. When the proposed model is built, the information conveyed by the fuzzy rules formed is two-fold, including (1) common fuzzy rules representing the inter-task correlation information and (2) individual fuzzy rules depicting the independent information of each task. The experimental results on several text sentiment datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed model.",

The thermal conditions along spring and summer influence the development of apple trees. The phenology of apple trees vary across harvests, mainly due to the air temperature. The number of days between phenological events increases as the minimum air temperature decreases. Predictive models to estimate phenological stages in apple trees as a function of the climate are essential to anticipate problems, helping agricultural technicians and engineers. Studies on the relationship between meteorological factors and phenological stages of other cultures, including fruit trees, are available in the literature. However, no previous work employs Fuzzy Time Series prediction mechanisms in the context of apple trees. In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate different Fuzzy Time Series variants and select the best performing one to predict the duration of phenological stages of apple trees as a function of temperature. In particular, we are considering univariate and multivariate methods. We conducted experiments using real data from a Brazilian agricultural institution, whose results evidence the effectiveness on the prediction of phenological stages of apple trees.",

This paper introduces an R package named fsr as an implementation of the fuzzy spatial data types, operations, and predicates of the Spatial Plateau Algebra that is based on the abstract Fuzzy Spatial Algebra. This R package solves the problem of constructing fuzzy spatial objects as spatial plateau objects from real datasets and describes how to conduct exploratory spatial data analysis by issuing geometric operations and topological predicates on fuzzy spatial objects. Further, fsr provides the possibility of designing fuzzy spatial inference models to discover new findings from fuzzy spatial objects.

Among the university rankings, Webometrics focused on quantitative studies related to website and content phenomena and is considered easy to measure because it bases ranking criteria on university activities on the internet. On the webometrics, the percentage of weight on the criteria of excellence which is quite high (40 %), makes the university pay attention to achieving that score. The existing method in weighting the criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) needs to include =n(n-1)/2 questions for each group of n-criteria paired comparisons. In this study, the Consistent Fuzzy Preference Relation (CFPR) method is used to study the factors/criteria to determine what strategy universities will take to improve the webometrics ranking in terms of excellence. The CFPR techniques are used to reduce expert assessment steps to only as much as n-1 to ensure consistency at the level with n criteria. Based on the calculation results, it can be concluded that the strategy for improving the excellence score is prioritized on three main criteria in sequence, namely improving scholarly rank (A), measuring the number of scientific papers (B), recognizing scholarly ranks (C). The weight of each criterion in the sequence is 0.51, 0.32, and 0.17. Some strategies to increase the excellence score based on the main priority of sub-criteria and sub-sub criteria are explained in this study.",

Therefore, Fuzzy Approximate Entropy is introduced as a nonlinear method to extract information features from HRV signals. This paper analyzed 30 PPG recordings (15 OSA, 15 normal), the length of these recordings are 6-7 hours and were divided into 5-minutes time slices. Compared with the classical method, the Fuzzy Approximate Entropy method shown a significant difference (p<0.01) and the highest accuracy of 76.7%. When combining with STD and LF/HF power ratio, the classification result reached an accuracy of 86.75%, sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 80%.

FCMs can now be optimized using machine learning and quantitative data, which means that an agent's mind can be automatically modified to closely align with an evidence base.

The research in this paper aims to help software development organizations complete the software engineering evaluations that are the efficient measures of software reliability. The metrics value of each evaluation criterion was elicited through expert opinion and an aggregation technology is then developed for transforming attribute values into intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) to obtain the collective evaluation of each alternative. Next, according to the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator, the collective attribute values are aggregated to overall evaluations of alternatives.

        "abstract": "Android apps are GUI-based event-driven software and have become ubiquitous in recent years. Obviously, functional correctness is critical for an app’s success. However, in addition to crash bugs, non-crashing functional bugs (in short as “non-crashing bugs” in this work) like inadvertent function failures, silent user data lost and incorrect display information are prevalent, even in popular, well-tested apps. These non-crashing functional bugs are usually caused by program logic errors and manifest themselves on the graphic user interfaces (GUIs). In practice, such bugs pose significant challenges in effectively detecting them because (1) current practices heavily rely on expensive, small-scale manual validation (the lack of automation); and (2) modern fully automated testing has been limited to crash bugs (the lack of test oracles). This paper fills this gap by introducing independent view fuzzing, a novel, fully automated approach for detecting non-crashing functional bugs in Android apps. Inspired by metamorphic testing, our key insight is to leverage the commonly-held independent view property of Android apps to manufacture property-preserving mutant tests from a set of seed tests that validate certain app properties. The mutated tests help exercise the tested apps under additional, adverse conditions. Any property violations indicate likely functional bugs for further manual confirmation. We have realized our approach as an automated, end-to-end functional fuzzing tool, Genie. Given an app, (1) Genie automatically detects non-crashing bugs without requiring human-provided tests and oracles (thus fully automated); and (2) the detected non-crashing bugs are diverse (thus general and not limited to specific functional properties), which set Genie apart from prior work. We have evaluated Genie on 12 real-world Android apps and successfully uncovered 34 previously unknown non-crashing bugs in their latest releases — all have been confirmed, and 22 have already been fixed. Most of the detected bugs are nontrivial and have escaped developer (and user) testing for at least one year and affected many app releases, thus clearly demonstrating Genie’s effectiveness. According to our analysis, Genie achieves a reasonable true positive rate of 40.9%, while these 34 non-crashing bugs could not be detected by prior fully automated GUI testing tools (as our evaluation confirms). Thus, our work complements and enhances existing manual testing and fully automated testing for crash bugs.",

The cost of a respin is high, and more than 40% of the cases that contribute to it are post-fabrication functional bug exposures  [16].

This paper presents a set of tools for RISC-V processor verification engineers that help to expose more bugs before production and increase the productivity of time spent on debugging, test creation and simulation. We present Logic Fuzzer (LF), a novel tool that expands the verification space exploration without the creation of additional verification tests. The LF randomizes the states or control signals of the design-under-test at the places that do not affect functionality. It brings the processor execution outside its normal flow to increase the number of microarchitectural states exercised by the tests. We also present Dromajo, the state of the art processor verification framework for RISC-V cores. Dromajo is an RV64GC emulator that was designed specifically for co-simulation purposes. It can boot Linux, handle external stimuli, such as interrupts and debug requests on the fly, and can be integrated into existing testbench infrastructure with minimal effort. We evaluate the effectiveness of the tools on three RISC-V cores: CVA6, BlackParrot, and BOOM. Dromajo by itself found a total of nine bugs. The enhancement of Dromajo with the Logic Fuzzer increases the exposed bug count to thirteen without creating additional verification tests.",

However, due to the limited batteries of sensor nodes and the difficulty for energy harvesting in UWSNs, it is challenging to localize sensor nodes successfully within a short sensor node lifetime in an unspecified underwater environment. Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Energy-Efficient Localization Algorithm (Adaptive EELA) to enable energy-efficient node localization while adapting to the dynamic environment changes. Adaptive EELA takes a fuzzy game-theoretic approach, whereby the Stackelberg game is used to model the interactions among sensor and anchor nodes in UWSNs and employs the adaptive neuro-fuzzy method to set the appropriate utility functions. We prove that a socially optimal Stackelberg–Nash equilibrium is achieved in Adaptive EELA. Through extensive numerical simulations under various environmental scenarios, the evaluation results show that our proposed algorithm accomplishes a significant energy reduction, e.g., 66% lower compared to baselines, while achieving a desired performance level in terms of localization coverage, error, and delay.",

RP is applied iteratively, according to various prioritization criteria, by multiple project stakeholders who may have different roles, needs and knowledge. In large-scale software projects, where the set of candidate requirements is large, stakeholders may not be interested in evaluating all requirements and they may not have the expertise, the time or the willingness to consider all candidate requirements. Recommender Systems (RS) can be a useful solution to information overload when stakeholders have to evaluate a large number of alternatives. During evaluation of requirements, it is often practically impossible to ensure that all stakeholders have complete knowledge on all requirements. Thus, stakeholders may show some degree of uncertainty and hesitation, as it is difficult to precisely evaluate each requirement according to each prioritization criterion. The intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs) are an extension of fuzzy sets which can deal with stakeholders’ uncertainty and hesitation regarding the prioritization criteria importance and requirements ratings. The aim of this paper is to present an RS approach based on the collaborative filtering technique to effectively provide suggestions to stakeholders while prioritizing requirements. The proposed RS approach is tested using a publicly available large dataset of software requirements and the results show an improved performance.",

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach named improved fuzzy actor-critic learning (IFACL) to solve this problem without modelling the map containing obstacles and complex calculation. Specifically, only the initial position, target position and obstacle position are needed as inputs for the algorithm to learn a desired path. Based on FACL, a penalty factor is added to enable agents obtaining the ability to avoid obstacles through punishing agents when exceeding position constraints. Then, to optimize the path planned, an excessive coordinate point which can be updated iteratively during the training process is utilized to calculate the reward with penalty factor. The simulation results prove the superiority and effectiveness of this algorithm in different scenarios with regular obstacles and hypothetical irregular obstacles. Due to the flexibility of FACL, this approach may be easily extended to path planning with velocity constraints and dynamic constraints.",

Using remote sensing image classification technology to detect the environment has become a hot research topic, but the traditional classification accuracy of maximum likelihood classification needs to be improved, how to improve the accuracy of remote sensing image classification has become the key to the research. In this paper, on the basis of neural network, genetic algorithm is used to optimize RBF neural network to classify images, and an xxxx fuzzy RBF neural network based on genetic algorithm is proposed to classify remote sensing images. On the basis of fuzzy control, this method can make the algorithm jump out of the optimization process of minimum points and accurately solve the global optimal solution. Finally, by preprocessing remote sensing images, the BP neural network classification method based on genetic algorithm is used, and the SVM decision tree classification method based on JM distance is used as the comparison algorithm to verify the accuracy of remote sensing image classification in this paper. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper can improve the accuracy of remote sensing image classification compared with the above two algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzy similarity join is an important database operator widely used in practice. So far the research community has focused exclusively on optimizing fuzzy joinscalability. However, practitioners today also struggle to optimize fuzzy-joinquality, because they face a daunting space of parameters (e.g., distance-functions, distance-thresholds, tokenization-options, etc.), and often have to resort to a manual trial-and-error approach to program these parameters in order to optimize fuzzy-join quality. This key challenge of automatically generating high-quality fuzzy-join programs has received surprisingly little attention thus far. In this work, we study the problem of \"auto-program'' fuzzy-joins. Leveraging a geometric interpretation of distance-functions, we develop an unsupervised Auto-FuzzyJoin framework that can infer suitable fuzzy-join programs on given input tables, without requiring explicit human input such as labelled training data. Using Auto-FuzzyJoin, users only need to provide two input tables L and R, and a desired precision target τ (say 0.9). Auto-FuzzyJoin leverages the fact that one of the input is a reference table to automatically program fuzzy-joins that meet the precision target τ in expectation, while maximizing fuzzy-join recall (defined as the number of correctly joined records). Experiments on both existing benchmarks and a new benchmark with 50 fuzzy-join tasks created from Wikipedia data suggest that the proposed Auto-FuzzyJoin significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches, and is surprisingly competitive even against supervised approaches (e.g., Magellan and DeepMatcher) when 50% of ground-truth labels are used as training data. We have released our code and benchmark on GitHub\\footnote\\urlhttps://github.com/chu-data-lab/AutomaticFuzzyJoin to facilitate future research.",

The security strength of logic locking is typically evaluated through functional and structural analysis-based attacks. There is limited work analyzing logic locking techniques' resilience against power-based side-channel attacks. To fill this gap, we propose an attack flow for the correlation power analysis (CPA) attack on the circuits encrypted with transistor-level logic locking. Our case studies indicate that CPA attacks outperform DPA attacks in terms of key recovery rate (KRR). To improve the CPA attack resilience of an existing transistor-level logic locking technique, we propose a logic-cone conjunction (LCC) method to enlarge the key space and reduce the correlation between the locking key and the power consumption of locked circuits. The experimental results show that the LCC method successfully reduces the KRR from 100% to 0% by using cyclic logic structures. The FPGA emulation indicates that the proposed method incurs 2.6% more delay and 1.5% more power consumption than the baseline.",

Recently, with the growing diversity of systems to be reasoned about (probabilistic, cyber-physical, etc.), the focus shifted to quantitative settings which resulted in a number of expressivity results for quantitative logics and behavioral metrics. Each of these quantitative expressivity results uses a tailor-made argument; distilling the essence of these arguments is non-trivial, yet important to support the design of expressive modal logics for new quantitative settings. In this paper, we present the first categorical framework for deriving quantitative expressivity results, based on the new notion of approximating family. A key ingredient is the codensity lifting---a uniform observation-centric construction of various bisimilarity-like notions such as bisimulation metrics. We show that several recent quantitative expressivity results (e.g. by König et al. and by Fijalkow et al.) are accommodated in our framework; a new expressivity result is derived, too, for what we call bisimulation uniformity.",

Usually multi-label classification algorithms output a numerical score for each label, indicative of their relevance to a query instance. However, in many applications the desired output is a bipartition of the labels into relevant and irrelevant w.r.t the query instance. Bipartitions can be obtained from scores using various thresholding strategies, such as PCut strategy which selects relevant instances per label, and RCut strategy which selects relevant labels per instance. However, we suggest that a combination of both strategies would provide better classification performance. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy-based approach to combine PCut and RCut strategies, by converting the crisp relevance into fuzzy one, merging them linearly, and defuzzifying again.

In recent years, fuzz testing has been remarkably successful; however, it is nontrivial to apply such traditional fuzzing to big data analytics directly because: (1) the long latency of DISC systems prohibits the applicability of fuzzing, and (2) conventional branch coverage is unlikely to identify application logic from the DISC framework implementation. We devise a novel fuzz testing tool called BigFuzz that automatically generates concrete data for an input Apache Spark program. The key essence of our approach is that we abstract the dataflow behavior of the DISC framework with executable specifications and we design schema-aware mutations based on common error types in DISC applications. Our experiments show that compared to random fuzzing, BigFuzz is able to speed up the fuzzing time by 1477X, improves application code coverage by 271%, and achieves 157% improvement in detecting application errors.

However, so far it has received little attention from the research community compared to single-mode fuzzing, leaving open several problems particularly in its task allocation strategies. Current approaches focus on managing micro tasks, at the seed input level, and their task division algorithms are either ad-hoc or static. In this paper, we leverage research on graph partitioning and search algorithms to propose a systematic and dynamic task allocation solution that works at the macro-task level. First, we design an attributed graph to capture both the program structures (e.g., program call graph) and fuzzing information (e.g., branch hit counts, bug discovery probability). Second, our graph partitioning algorithm divides the global program search space into sub-search-spaces. Finally our search algorithm prioritizes these sub-search-spaces (i.e., tasks) and explores them to maximize code coverage and number of bugs found. The results are collected to update the graph and guide further iterations of partitioning and exploration. We implemented a prototype tool called AFLTeam. In our preliminary experiments on well-tested benchmarks, AFLTeam achieved higher code coverage (up to 16.4% branch coverage improvement) compared to the default parallel mode of AFL and discovered 2 zero-day bugs in FFmpeg and JasPer toolkits.",

A recent advancement in binary fuzzing performance is Coverage-guided Tracing (CGT), which brings orders-of-magnitude gains in throughput by restricting the expense of coverage tracing to only when new coverage is guaranteed. Unfortunately, CGT suits only a basic block coverage granularity---yet most fuzzers require finer-grain coverage metrics: edge coverage and hit counts. It is this limitation which prohibits nearly all of today's state-of-the-art fuzzers from attaining the performance benefits of CGT. This paper tackles the challenges of adapting CGT to fuzzing's most ubiquitous coverage metrics. We introduce and implement a suite of enhancements that expand CGT's introspection to fuzzing's most common code coverage metrics, while maintaining its orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional always-on coverage tracing. We evaluate their trade-offs with respect to fuzzing performance and effectiveness across 12 diverse real-world binaries (8 open- and 4 closed-source). On average, our coverage-preserving CGT attains near-identical speed to the present block-coverage-only CGT, UnTracer; and outperforms leading binary- and source-level coverage tracers QEMU, Dyninst, RetroWrite, and AFL-Clang by 2--24x, finding more bugs in less time.",

However, the validation of RTOS is challenging due to its complex real-time features and large code base.In this paper, we propose Rtkaller, a state-aware kernel fuzzer for the vulnerability detection in RTOS. First, Rtkaller implements an automatic task initialization to transform the syscall sequences into initial tasks with more real-time information. Then, a coverage-guided task mutation is designed to generate those tasks that explore more in-depth real-time related code for parallel execution. Moreover, Rtkaller realizes a task modification to correct those tasks that may hang during fuzzing. We evaluated it on recent versions of rt-Linux, which is one of the most widely used RTOS. Compared to the state-of-the-art kernel fuzzers Syzkaller and Moonshine, Rtkaller  achieves the same code coverage at the speed of 1.7X  and 1.6X, gains an increase of 26.1% and 22.0% branch coverage within 24 hours respectively. More importantly, Rtkaller  has confirmed 28 previously unknown vulnerabilities that are missed by other fuzzers.",

        "abstract": "With the wide application and deployment of cloud computing in enterprises, virtualization developers and security researchers are paying more attention to cloud computing security. The core component of cloud computing products is the hypervisor, which is also known as the virtual machine monitor (VMM) that can isolate multiple virtual machines in one host machine. However, compromising the hypervisor can lead to virtual machine escape and the elevation of privilege, allowing attackers to gain the permission of code execution in the host. Therefore, the security analysis and vulnerability detection of the hypervisor are critical for cloud computing enterprises. Importantly, virtual devices expose many interfaces to a guest user for communication, making virtual devices the most vulnerable part of a hypervisor. However, applying fuzzing to the virtual devices of a hypervisor is challenging because the data structures transferred by DMA are constructed in a nested form according to protocol specifications. Failure to understand the protocol of the virtual devices will make the fuzzing process stuck in the initial fuzzing stage, resulting in inefficient fuzzing. In this paper, we propose a new framework called V-Shuttle to conduct hypervisor fuzzing, which performs scalable and semantics-aware hypervisor fuzzing. To address the above challenges, we first design a DMA redirection mechanism to significantly reduce the manual efforts to reconstruct virtual devices' protocol structures and make the fuzzing environment setup automated and scalable. Furthermore, we put forward a new fuzzing mutation scheduling mechanism called seedpool to make the virtual device fuzzing process semantics-aware and speed up the fuzzing process to achieve high coverage. Extensive evaluation on QEMU and VirtualBox, two of the most popular hypervisor platforms among the world, shows that V-Shuttle can efficiently reproduce existing vulnerabilities and find new vulnerabilities. We further carried out a long-term fuzzing campaign in QEMU/KVM and VirtualBox with V-Shuttle. In total, we discovered 35 new bugs with 17 CVEs assigned.",

Inspired by the success stories of fuzz testing, we design a graph-based fuzz testing method to improve the quality of DL inference engines. This method is naturally followed by the graph structure of DL models. A novel operator-level coverage criterion based on graph theory is introduced and six different mutations are implemented to generate diversified DL models by exploring combinations of model structures, parameters, and data inputs. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used to drive DL model generation without a training process. The experimental results show that the MCTS outperforms the random method in boosting operator-level coverage and detecting exceptions. Our method has discovered more than 40 different exceptions in three types of undesired behaviors: model conversion failure, inference failure, output comparison failure. The mutation strategies are useful to generate new valid test inputs, by up to an 8.2% more operator-level coverage on average and 8.6 more exceptions captured.",

Once compromised, it could be misused to control or manipulate these physical devices maliciously, endangering manufacturing process or even human lives. Therefore, extensive security testing of supervisory software is crucial for the safe operation of ICS. However, fuzzing ICS supervisory software is challenging due to the prevalent use of proprietary protocols. Without the knowledge of the program states and packet formats, it is difficult to enter the deep states for effective fuzzing.  In this work, we present a fuzzing framework to automatically discover implementation bugs residing in the communication protocols between the supervisory software and the field devices. To avoid heavy human efforts in reverse-engineering the proprietary protocols, the proposed approach constructs a state-book based on the readily-available execution trace of the supervisory software and the corresponding inputs. Then, we propose a state selection algorithm to find the protocol states that are more likely to have bugs. Our fuzzer distributes more budget on those interesting states. To quickly reach the interesting states, traditional snapshot-based method does not work since the communication protocols are time sensitive. We address this issue by synchronously managing external events (GUI operations and network traffic) during the fuzzing loop. We have implemented a prototype and used it to fuzz the supervisory software of four popular ICS platforms. We have found 13 bugs and received 3 CVEs, 2 are classified as critical (CVSS3.x score CRITICAL 9.8) and affected 40 different products.",

In this paper, we propose SNAP, a customized hardware platform that implements hardware primitives to enhance the performance and precision of coverage-guided fuzzing. By sitting at the bottom of the computer stack, SNAP leverages the existing CPU pipeline and micro-architectural features to provide coverage tracing and rich execution semantics with near-zero cost regardless of source code availability.

To improve their correctness, the industry has been applying blackbox fuzzing for decades. Recently, the research community achieved impressive fuzzing gains using coverage guidance. However, due to the complexity and distributed nature of enterprise-level DBMSs, seldom are these researches applied to the industry. In this paper, we apply coverage-guided fuzzing to enterpriselevel DBMSs from Huawei and Bloomberg LP. In our practice of testing GaussDB and Comdb2, we found major challenges in all three testing stages. The challenges are collecting precise coverage, optimizing fuzzing performance, and analyzing root causes. In search of a general method to overcome these challenges, we propose Ratel, a coverage-guided fuzzer for enterprise-level DBMSs. With its industry-oriented design, Ratel improves the feedback precision, enhances the robustness of input generation, and performs an on-line investigation on the root cause of bugs. As a result, Ratel outperformed other fuzzers in terms of coverage and bugs. Compared to industrial black box fuzzers SQLsmith and SQLancer, as well as coverage-guided academic fuzzer Squirrel, Ratel covered 38.38%, 106.14%, 583.05% more basic blocks than the best results of other three fuzzers in GaussDB, PostgreSQL, and Comdb2, respectively.

        "abstract": "Operating system code interacting with the devices attached to our computers, device drivers, are often provided by their respective vendors. As they may run with kernel privileges, this effectively means that kernel code is written by third parties. Some of these may not live up to the high security standards the core kernel code abides by. A single bug in a driver can harm the complete operating system’s integrity, just as if the bug was in the kernel itself. Attackers can exploit these bugs to escape sandboxes and to gain system privileges. Automated security testing of device drivers is hard. It depends on the attached device, and the driver code is not freely available. Dependency on a physical device increases the complexity even further. To alleviate these issues, we present BSOD, a fuzzing framework for high-complexity device drivers, based on KVM-VMI. BSOD retargets the well-known and battle-proven fuzzers, Syzkaller and AFL-2++, for binary-only drivers. We do not depend on vendor-specific CPU features and exceed 10k execs/sec on COTS hardware for coverage-guided kernel fuzzing. For evaluation, we focus on the highly complex closed-source drivers of a major graphics-card vendor for multiple operating systems. To overcome the strict hardware dependency of device driver fuzzing, making scaling impractical, we implement BSOD-fakedev, a virtual record & replay device, able to load a full graphics card driver without a physical device attached. It allows to scale fuzz campaigns to a large number of machines without the need for additional hardware. BSOD was able to uncover numerous bugs in graphics card drivers on Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD.",

Such a trend is already happening in the domain of machine learning and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems built on edge devices. Yet, debugging and testing methods for heterogeneous applications are currently lacking. These applications may look similar to regular C/C++ code but include hardware synthesis details in terms of preprocessor directives. Therefore, their behavior under heterogeneous architectures may diverge significantly from CPU due to hardware synthesis details. Further, the compilation and hardware simulation cycle takes an enormous amount of time, prohibiting frequent invocations required for fuzz testing.   We propose a novel fuzz testing technique, called HeteroFuzz, designed to specifically target heterogeneous applications and to detect platform-dependent divergence. The key essence of HeteroFuzz is that it uses a three-pronged approach to reduce the long latency of repetitively invoking a hardware simulator on a heterogeneous application. First, in addition to monitoring code coverage as a fuzzing guidance mechanism, we analyze synthesis pragmas in kernel code and monitor accelerator-relevant value spectra. Second, we design dynamic probabilistic mutations to increase the chance of hitting divergent behavior under different platforms. Third, we memorize the boundaries of seen kernel inputs and skip HLS simulator invocation if it can expose only redundant divergent behavior. We evaluate HeteroFuzz on seven real-world heterogeneous applications with FPGA kernels. HeteroFuzz is 754X faster in exposing the same set of distinct divergence symptoms than naive fuzzing. Probabilistic mutations contribute to 17.5X speed up than the one without. Selective invocation of HLS simulation contributes to 8.8X speed up than the one without.",

In recent times, many studies have applied machine learning predictive models in medication adherence system across specific chronic diseases using patient's clinical data. However, only a very few studies had attempted to leverage on patient's non-clinical data such as patient's belief, behavioral pattern, knowledge and others as input parameters in their predictive models. Studies outcomes have also shown that these non-clinical data have high influence on patient's non-adherence to medication thereby making them strong determinants. In this paper, we introduce a prognosis approach that can help to predict patient's non-adherence level to medication at the first clinic visit even before prescription commences. The prognosis approach is described by using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy (ANF) predictive model that adopt the use of non-clinical data of patient to serve as input variables of the model. This study is a preliminary report of an ongoing innovative and intelligent healthcare project to improve patient adherence to medication. We developed a certified questionnaire based on health belief theory to collect the non-clinical data from out-patients with chronic disease who are receiving treatment so as to test the performance of the proposed framework. The predicted patient level of non-adherence output would be optimized and stratified to determine an appropriate intervention functions and delivery techniques towards the particular needs of the patient. Various components of the framework; features and functions; taxonomy of intervention techniques; design guidelines; and recommendations for efficient integrations and deployment in healthcare centers are presented. This would serve as a veritable prognosis and prediction tool to improve adherence to medication as the level of non-adherence to medication of the patient would be easily determined.",

In this paper, we present Falcon, a fuzzing technique that explores both the formula space and the configuration space. Combining the two spaces significantly enlarges the search space and makes it challenging to detect bugs efficiently. We solve this problem by utilizing the correlations between the two spaces to reduce the search space, and introducing an adaptive mutation strategy to boost the search efficiency. During six months of extensive testing, Falcon finds 518 confirmed bugs in CVC4 and Z3, two state-of-the-art SMT solvers, 469 of which have already been fixed.

        "abstract": "JavaScript engines have been shown prone to security vulnerabilities, which can lead to serious consequences due to their popularity. Fuzzing is an effective testing technique to discover vulnerabilities. The main challenge of fuzzing JavaScript engines is to generate syntactically and semantically valid inputs such that deep functionalities can be explored. However, due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript and the special features of different engines, it is quite challenging to generate semantically meaningful test inputs. We observed that state-of-the-art semantic-aware JavaScript fuzzers usually require manually written rules to analyze the semantics for a JavaScript engine, which is labor-intensive, incomplete and engine-specific. Moreover, the error rate of generated test cases is still high. Another challenge is that existing fuzzers cannot generate new method calls that are not included in the initial seed corpus or pre-defined rules, which limits the bug-finding capability.  To this end, we propose a novel semantic-aware fuzzing technique named SoFi. To guarantee the validity of the generated test cases, SoFi adopts a fine-grained program analysis to identify available variables and infer types of these variables for the mutation. Moreover, an automatic repair strategy is proposed to repair syntax/semantic errors in invalid test cases. To improve the exploration capability of SoFi, we propose a reflection-based analysis to identify unseen attributes and methods of objects, which are further used in the mutation. With fine-grained analysis and reflection-based augmentation, SoFi can generate more valid and diverse test cases. Besides, SoFi is general in different JavaScript engines without any manual configuration (e.g., the grammar rules). The evaluation results have shown that SoFi outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in generating semantically valid inputs, improving code coverage and detecting more bugs. SoFi discovered 51 bugs in popular JavaScript engines, 28 of which have been confirmed or fixed by the developers and 10 CVE IDs have been assigned.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made people's lives more convenient, but it has also raised many security concerns. Due to the difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, in the absence of internal execution information, black-box fuzzing of IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. In addition, because of the prevalent use of various and non-standard communication message formats in IoT devices, it is difficult or even impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer), but also utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore, Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on 20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify 5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz. All the newly discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by their vendors.",

        "abstract": "Side channels pose a significant threat to the confidentiality of software systems. Such vulnerabilities are challenging to detect and evaluate because they arise from non-functional properties of software such as execution times and require reasoning on multiple execution traces. Recently, noninterference notions have been adapted in static analysis, symbolic execution, and greybox fuzzing techniques. However, noninterference is a strict notion and may reject security even if the strength of information leaks are weak. A quantitative notion of security allows for the relaxation of noninterference and tolerates small (unavoidable) leaks. Despite progress in recent years, the existing quantitative approaches have scalability limitations in practice.   In this work, we present QFuzz, a greybox fuzzing technique to quantitatively evaluate the strength of side channels with a focus on min entropy. Min entropy is a measure based on the number of distinguishable observations (partitions) to assess the resulting threat from an attacker who tries to compromise secrets in one try. We develop a novel greybox fuzzing equipped with two partitioning algorithms that try to maximize the number of distinguishable observations and the cost differences between them.   We evaluate QFuzz on a large set of benchmarks from existing work and real-world libraries (with a total of 70 subjects). QFuzz compares favorably to three state-of-the-art detection techniques. QFuzz provides quantitative information about leaks beyond the capabilities of all three techniques. Crucially, we compare QFuzz to a state-of-the-art quantification tool and find that QFuzz significantly outperforms the tool in scalability while maintaining similar precision. Overall, we find that our approach scales well for real-world applications and provides useful information to evaluate resulting threats. Additionally, QFuzz identifies a zero-day side-channel vulnerability in a security critical Java library that has since been confirmed and fixed by the developers.",

This article addresses the problem of multi-robot navigation where individual robots require coordination. Although a few such attempts for modeling multi-robot coordination and navigation have been studied, this work proposes a game-theoretic coordination strategy, also referred to as strategic coordination. We make use of a genetic algorithm tuned fuzzy logic–based motion planner. The proposed strategic coordination strategy has been pitted against a basic potential field-based motion planner, also referred to as the heuristic method, for performance comparison. Results are compared through computer simulation with 8 to 17 robots at different rounds. From the obtained results, it was observed that the proposed coordination scheme’s efficacy is strong for a larger number of robots. In addition, the proposed strategic coordination scheme with the genetic-fuzzy-based motion planner was found to outperform other combinations as far as the quality of solutions and time to reach the goal positions. The computational complexity of different methods has also been compared and presented.",

Therefore, a model is constructed based on the collaborative filtering algorithm and fuzzy network theory to calculate the node trust value as the weight of weighted data fusion. First, a FTWDF (Feedback Trust Weighted for Data Fusion) is proposed. Second, EEFA (Efficiency unequal Fuzzy clustering Algorithm) is introduced into FTWDF considering the defects of the clustering structure caused by ignoring the randomness of node energy consumption and cluster head selection in the practical application of the existing data fusion algorithm. Besides, the fuzzy logic is applied to cluster head selection and node clustering. Finally, an FTWDF-EEFA clustering algorithm is constructed for generating candidate cluster head nodes, which is verified by simulation experiments. The comparative analysis reveals that the accuracy of the FTWDF-EEFA clustering algorithm is 4.1% higher than that of the TMDF (Trust Multiple attributes Decision-making-based data Fusion) algorithm, and 8.3% higher than that of LDTS (Larger Data fusion based on node Trust evaluation in wireless Sensor networks) algorithm. It performs better in accuracy and recommendation results during the processing of ML100M dataset and NF5M dataset. Besides, the new clustering algorithm increases the survival time of nodes when analyzing the number of death nodes to prolong networks’ lifespan. It improves the survival period of nodes, balances the network load, and prolongs networks’ lifespan. Furthermore, the FTWDF-EEFA clustering algorithm can balance nodes’ energy consumption and effectively save nodes’ overall energy through analysis. Therefore, the optimized algorithm can increase the lifespan of network and improve the trust mechanism effectively.

Researchers improve it by optimizing the coverage metrics without questioning the correctness of the instrumentation. However, instrumentation errors, including missed instrumentation locations and redundant instrumentation locations, harm the ability of fuzzers. According to our experiments, it is a common and severe problem in various coverage-based greybox fuzzers and at different compiler optimization levels. In this paper, we design and implement InstruGuard, an open-source and pragmatic platform to find and fix instrumentation errors. It detects instrumentation errors by static analysis on target binaries, and fixes them with a general solution based on binary rewriting. To study the impact of instrumentation errors and test our solutions, we built a dataset of 15 real-world programs and selected 6 representative fuzzers as targets. We used InstruGuard to check and repair the instrumented binaries with different fuzzers and different compiler optimization options. To evaluate the effectiveness of the repair, we ran the fuzzers with original instrumented programs and the repaired ones, and compared the fuzzing results from aspects of execution paths, line coverage, and real bug findings. The results showed that InstruGuard had corrected the instrumentation errors of different fuzzers and helped to find more bugs in the dataset. Moreover, we discovered one new zero-day vulnerability missed by other fuzzers with fixed instrumentation but without any changes to the fuzzers.",

Fuzzing is a practical approach for examining the robustness of programs. However, existing fuzzing tools are not directly applicable to library APIs due to the absence of fuzz targets. It mainly relies on human efforts to design fuzz targets case by case which is labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel automated fuzz target generation approach for fuzzing Rust libraries via API dependency graph traversal. We identify several essential requirements for library fuzzing, including validity and effectiveness of fuzz targets, high API coverage, and efficiency. To meet these requirements, we first employ breadth-first search with pruning to find API sequences under a length threshold, then we backward search longer sequences for uncovered APIs, and finally we optimize the sequence set as a set covering problem. We implement our fuzz target generator and conduct fuzzing experiments with AFL++ on several real-world popular Rust projects. Our tool finally generates 7 to 118 fuzz targets for each library with API coverage up to 0.92. We exercise each target with a threshold of 24 hours and find 30 previously-unknown bugs from seven libraries.",

In this paper, we share our observations of the Ant Group's status quo in testing their financial services, specifically on the importance of properly transforming relevant external environment settings and prioritizing input object fields for mutation during automated fuzzing. Based on these observations, we propose FinFuzzer, an automated fuzz testing framework that detects and transforms relevant environmental settings into system inputs, prioritizes input object fields, and mutates system inputs on both environment settings and high-priority object fields. Our evaluation of FinFuzzer against four FinTech systems developed by the Ant Group shows that FinFuzzer can outperform a state-of-the-art approach in terms of line coverage in much shorter time.",

        "abstract": "Android, the most popular mobile system, offers a number of app-independent, user-configurable settings (e.g., network, location and permission) for controlling the devices and the apps. However, apps may fail to properly adapt their behaviors when these settings are changed, and thus frustrate users. We name such issues as setting issues, which reside in the apps and are induced by the changes of settings. According to our investigation, the majority of setting issues are non-crash (logic) bugs, which however cannot be detected by existing automated app testing techniques due to the lack of test oracles. To this end, we designed and introduced, setting-wise metamorphic fuzzing, the first automated testing technique to overcome the oracle problem in detecting setting issues. Our key insight is that, in most cases, the app behaviors should keep consistent if a given setting is changed and later properly restored. We realized this technique as an automated GUI testing tool, SetDroid, and applied it on 26 popular, open-source Android apps. SetDroid successfully found 32 unique, previously-unknown setting issues in these apps. So far, 25 have been confirmed and 17 were already fixed. We further applied SetDroid on 4 commercial apps with billions of monthly active users and successfully detected 15 previously unknown setting issues, all of which have been confirmed and under fixing. The majority of all these bugs (37 out of 47) are noncrash bugs, which cannot be detected by prior testing techniques.",

Greybox fuzzing has been shown effective in detecting vulnerabilities. However, applications in IoT or mobile devices are usually proprietary to specific vendors, fuzzers are required to support binary-only targets. Moreover, since these devices are of heterogeneous architecture, assigned with limited resources, and many testing targets are server-like programs, applying existing fuzzing techniques faces great challenges. This paper proposes BiFF, a general-purpose fuzzer that aims to stress these issues. It supports binary-only targets, is general (supports multiple CPU architectures including Intel, ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC), fast (has the lowest runtime overhead compared to existing fuzzers), and flexible (uses a new fuzzing workflow that can fuzz any piece of code inside the target binary). Experiments demonstrate that BiFF has the best performance compared with state-of-the-art binary fuzzers and can fuzz the server-like programs which cannot be fuzzed by the existing fuzzers. Using BiFF, we've found 24 unknown vulnerabilities (including memory corruptions, infinite loops, and infinite recursions) in industrial products.",

Unfortunately, such a characteristic makes it difficult for existing fuzzers to find out critical transaction sequences. To tackle this challenge, we employ both static and dynamic analyses for fuzzing smart contracts. First, we statically analyze smart contract bytecodes to predict which transaction sequences will lead to effective testing, and figure out if there is a certain constraint that each transaction should satisfy. Such information is then passed to the fuzzing phase and used to construct an initial seed corpus. During a fuzzing campaign, we perform a lightweight dynamic data-flow analysis to collect data-flow-based feedback to effectively guide fuzzing. We implement our ideas on a practical open-source fuzzer, named Smartian. Smartian can discover bugs in real-world smart contracts without the need for the source code. Our experimental results show that Smartian is more effective than existing state-of-the-art tools in finding known CVEs from real-world contracts. Smartian also outperforms other tools in terms of code coverage.",

In implementing a security policy, the browser only has access to HTTP requests and responses, and takes policy actions based solely on those interactions. In checking the browser security policies, CorbFuzz uses a policy oracle that tracks the web application behavior and infers the desired policy action based on the web application state. By comparing the policy oracle with the browser behavior, CorbFuzz detects weaknesses in browser security policies. CorbFuzz checks the web browser policy by fuzzing a set of web applications where the state-related queries are symbolically evaluated for increased coverage and automation. CorbFuzz collects type information from database queries and branch conditions in order to prevent the generation of inconsistent data values during fuzzing. We evaluated CorbFuzz on CORB implementations of Chromium and Webkit, and Opaque Response Blocking (ORB) policy implementation of Firefox using web applications collected from GitHub.

The current article aims to tackle the increased hardware cost of floating-point multiplication units, which prohibits their usage in embedded computing. We introduce AFMU (Approximate Floating-point MUltiplier), an area/power-efficient family of multipliers, which apply two approximation techniques in the resource-hungry mantissa multiplication and can be seamlessly extended to support dynamic configuration of the approximation levels via gating signals. AFMU offers large accuracy configuration margins, provides negligible logic overhead for dynamic configuration, and detects unexpected results that may arise due to the approximations. Our evaluation shows that AFMU delivers energy gains in the range 3.6%–53.5% for half-precision and 37.2%–82.4% for single-precision, in exchange for mean relative error around 0.05%–3.33% and 0.01%–2.20%, respectively. In comparison with state-of-the-art multipliers, AFMU exhibits up to 4–6× smaller error on average while delivering more energy-efficient computing. The evaluation in image processing shows that AFMU provides sufficient quality of service, i.e., more than 50db PSNR and near 1 SSIM values, and up to 57.4% power reduction. When used in floating-point CNNs, the accuracy loss is small (or zero), i.e., up to 5.4% for MNIST and CIFAR-10, in exchange for up to 63.8% power gain.",

        "abstract": "Identifying as early as possible fault prone modules in order to facilitate continuous delivery in large software systems, has been an area where significant attention has been paid over the past few years. Recent efforts consider source code metrics and process metrics for training machine learning models to predict whether a software source code file is fault prone or not. In such prediction frameworks the accuracy of the trained model relies heavily on the features selected and the profiles of the metrics used for training the model which are unique to each system. Furthermore, these models act as black-boxes, where the end-user does not know how a specific prediction was reached. In this paper, we propose an approach which allows for domain expert knowledge to be combined with machine learning in order to yield fault-proneness prediction models that both exhibit high levels of recall and at the same time are able to provide explanations to the developers as to how and why these predictions were reached. For this paper we apply two rule-based inferencing techniques namely, Fuzzy reasoning, and Markov Logic Networks. The main contribution of this work is that it allows for expert developers to identify in the form of if-then rules domain logic that pertains to the fault-proneness of a source code file in the specific system being analysed. Results obtained from 19 open source systens indicate that MLNs perform better than Fuzzy Logic models and that project-customized rules achieve better results than generic rules. Furthermore, results indicate that its possible to compile a common set of rules that yields consistently acceptable results across different projects.",

High spatial resolution is required to display complex, intricate spatial forms, and heterogeneous dimensions. However, the application of GIS in spatial planning still has problems, including uncertainty. Uncertainty is a description of the problem that comes from imperfection. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the systematic analysis of GIS-based spatial uncertainty. To date, such analyzes have been rarely or satisfactorily performed. The conceptual model consists of three domains in which the main potential sources of uncertainty are systematically exposed. The first domain is the production-oriented uncertainty inherent in administrative boundary issues and zoning rules. Vagueness and ambiguity represent suitable concepts at this stage. Transformation-oriented uncertainty as a second domain occurs due to the zoning topology digital editing and processing. Thus, the corresponding uncertainty concept is an error. The third domain is application-oriented uncertainty. Validation of land use is needed so that spatial planning can be efficient by comparing application data with conditions in the Field. Error is a suitable concept to represent the uncertainty in the domain. Based on the research results, the framework can potentially access the complex nature of uncertainty and characterize the most relevant concepts for analysis. Uncertainty in geographic information at this time should be considered as an integral part that must be built into our knowledge. Anyone using uncertain information needs to think carefully about possible sources of uncertainty and how they can be handled.",

        "abstract": "Constructive foundations have for decades been built upon realizability models for higher-order logic and type theory. However, traditional realizability models have a rather limited notion of computation, which only supports non-termination and avoids many other commonly used effects. Work to address these limitations has typically overlaid structure on top of existing models, such as by using powersets to represent non-determinism, but kept the realizers themselves deterministic. This paper alternatively addresses these limitations by making the structure underlying realizability models more flexible. To this end, we introduce evidenced frames: a general-purpose framework for building realizability models that support diverse effectful computations. We demonstrate that this flexibility permits models wherein the realizers themselves can be effectful, such as λ-terms that can manipulate state, reduce non-deterministically, or fail entirely. Beyond the broader notions of computation, we demonstrate that evidenced frames form a unifying framework for (realizability) models of higher-order dependent predicate logic. In particular, we prove that evidenced frames are complete with respect to these models, and that the existing completeness construction for implicative algebras-another foundational framework for realizability-factors through our simpler construction. As such, we conclude that evidenced frames offer an ideal domain for unifying and broadening realizability models.",

The (f, Γ)-divergences inherit features from IPMs, such as the ability to compare distributions which are not absolutely continuous, as well as from f-divergences, namely the strict concavity of their variational representations and the ability to control heavy-tailed distributions for particular choices of f. When combined, these features establish a divergence with improved properties for estimation, statistical learning, and uncertainty quantification applications. Using statistical learning as an example, we demonstrate their advantage in training generative adversarial networks (GANs) for heavy-tailed, not-absolutely continuous sample distributions.

However, many fixed PUF designs may suffer from unsatisfactory statistical properties in terms of uniqueness, uniformity, and robustness. Moreover, a PUF signature may alter over time due to aging or changing operating conditions, rendering a PUF insecure in the worst case. As a remedy, we propose CHOICE, a novel class of FPGA-based PUF designs with tunable uniqueness and reliability characteristics. By the use of addressable shift registers available on an FPGA, we show that a wide configuration space for adjusting a device-specific PUF response is obtained without any sacrifice of randomness. In particular, we demonstrate the concept of address-tunable propagation delays, whereby we are able to increase or decrease the probability of obtaining “1”s in the PUF response. Experimental evaluations on a group of six 28 nm Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs show that CHOICE PUFs provide a large range of configurations to allow a fine-tuning to an average uniqueness between 49% and 51%, while simultaneously achieving bit error rates below 1.5%, thus outperforming state-of-the-art PUF designs. Moreover, with only a single FPGA slice per PUF bit, CHOICE is one of the smallest PUF designs currently available for FPGAs. It is well-known that signal propagation delays are affected by temperature, as the operating temperature impacts the internal currents of transistors that ultimately make up the circuit. We therefore comprehensively investigate how temperature variations affect the PUF response and demonstrate how the tunability of CHOICE enables us to determine configurations that show a high robustness to such variations. As a case study, we present a cryptographic key generation scheme based on CHOICE PUF responses as device-intrinsic secret and investigate the design objectives resource costs, performance, and temperature robustness to show the practicability of our approach.",

Typically, amount of ants in the ACO algorithm is fixed at certain number while the search space technique (i.e. to explore or exploit new possible solutions) is randomized for each iteration in the entire algorithm, are potentially affect the optimization's efficiency. Thus this paper proposes a new variant of ACO algorithm called as a tuned version of ACO for generating variable strength interaction in t-way testing strategy (VS-TACO). VS-TACO applied a Mamdani fuzzy logic in order to dynamically choose the number of ant and decide which search space technique to be used. Experiments that have been conducted on VS-TACO and benchmarked with other strategies, shows VS-TACO produce a competitive result in term of test suite size.",

The rationale of this method by the survey of engineering English students confirms that fuzzy logic-based Natural Language Processing and Data Analysis approaches can be employed effectively in language education and research.

Marginalizing the probability of each possible world on a candidate motif can drastically reduce the number of possible worlds that need be considered when the size of motif is small. Experiments using real-world data confirm that the proposed method is effective and efficient. It is far better than the state-of-the-art sampling-based method. The accuracy is guaranteed and the running time is about 4 order of magnitude faster. It runs at a speed that does not depend on the connection probability.",

        "abstract": "The recognition of stress is an important issue from a health care perspective as well as in the human-computer interaction context. With the help of multimodal sensors, stress can be detected relatively well under laboratory conditions. However, when models are used in the real world, shifts in the data distribution can occur, often leading to performance degradation. It is therefore desirable that models in these scenarios are at least able to accurately capture this uncertainty and thus know what they do not know. This work aims to investigate how synthetic shifts in the data distribution can affect the reliability of a multimodal stress detection model in terms of calibration and uncertainty quantification. We compare a baseline with three known approaches that aim to improve reliability of uncertainty estimates. Our results show that all methods we tested improve the calibration. However, calibration generally deteriorates and spreads with stronger shifts for all approaches. They perform especially poorly for shifts in highly relevant modalities. Overall, we conclude that in the conducted experiments the investigated methods are not sufficiently reliable under distribution shifts.",

Both the noisy-OR Bayesian network and the posterior distribution neural network are optimized to maximize the variational lower bound of the true log-likelihood. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, we used the MNIST handwritten digit dataset for unsupervised learning of noisy-OR Bayesian networks. We confirmed that noisy-OR Bayesian networks with up to 128 latent variables can learn the given dataset using NVIL.

In this paper, we propose TriLock, a sequential logic locking method that simultaneously addresses these vulnerabilities. TriLock can achieve high, tunable functional corruptibility while still guaranteeing exponential queries to the SAT solver in a SAT-based attack. Further, it adopts a state re-encoding method to obscure the boundary between the original state registers and those inserted by the locking method, thus making it more difficult to detect and remove the locking-related components.",

Symbolic abstraction is an important point in the space of abstract interpretation, as it allows for automatically synthesizing the best abstract transformers. However, current techniques for symbolic abstraction can have difficulty delivering on its practical strengths, due to performance issues. In this work, we introduce two algorithms for the symbolic abstraction of quantifier-free bit-vector formulas, which apply to the bit-vector interval domain and a certain kind of polyhedral domain, respectively. We implement and evaluate the proposed techniques on two machine code analysis clients, namely static memory corruption analysis and constrained random fuzzing. Using a suite of 57,933 queries from the clients, we compare our approach against a diverse group of state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments show that our algorithms achieve a substantial speedup over existing techniques and illustrate significant precision advantages for the clients. Our work presents strong evidence that symbolic abstraction of numeric domains can be efficient and practical for large and realistic programs.",

This includes an iterative process where approximate circuit instances are created and evaluated in terms of quality and performance metrics. The quality evaluation of each instance via either verification or testing results in extremely long computation times, imposing a practical limit on the number of nodes that can be explored in the design space. To overcome this problem, we exploit Random Forests (RFs) to develop extremely fast estimators to evaluate the quality and performance of AxC instances while avoiding time-consuming computations. Utilizing these estimators we build LDAX, an efficient design space exploration framework that attempts to improve the runtime of the AxCs synthesis process. LDAX is based on the fact that, in an iterative search space exploration, a large number of validations can be skipped by leveraging a high-accuracy predictor. To efficiently explore the design space, which is usually represented by a tree and each node denotes an AxC, we propose a learning-based search technique that can quickly analyze a large set of nodes even very deep nodes in the tree. Our experimental results reveal that LDAX can achieve average speed-up of 41 × on a set of practical benchmarks from different application domains in comparison with the most competitive state-of-the-art framework.",

Various Automatic Text Summarization techniques have been developed for abstractive as well as extractive summarization. This study focuses on extractive summarization which is a process containing selected delineative paragraphs or sentences from the original text and combining these into smaller forms than the document(s) to generate a summary. The methods that have been used for extractive summarization are based on a graph-theoretic approach, machine learning, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), neural networks, cluster, and fuzzy logic. In this paper, a semantic graph-based approach SGATS (Semantic Graph-based approach for Automatic Text Summarization) is proposed to generate an extractive summary. The proposed approach constructs a semantic graph of the original Hindi text document by establishing a semantic relationship between sentences of the document using Hindi Wordnet ontology as a background knowledge source. Once the semantic graph is constructed, fourteen different graph theoretical measures are applied to rank the document sentences depending on their semantic scores. The proposed approach is applied to two data sets of different domains of Tourism and Health. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art TextRank algorithm and human-annotated summary. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using widely accepted ROUGE measures. The outcomes exhibit that our proposed system produces better results than TextRank for health domain corpus and comparable results for tourism corpus. Further, correlation coefficient methods are applied to find a correlation between eight different graphical measures and it is observed that most of the graphical measures are highly correlated.",

Despite extensive research efforts, secure allocators can only be evaluated by with theoretical analysis or pre-defined data sets, which are insufficient to effectively reflect powerful adversaries in the real world. In this paper, we present HardsHeap, an automatic tool for evaluating secure allocators. The key idea of HardsHeap is to use random testing (i.e., fuzzing) to evaluate secure allocators. To handle the diverse properties of secure allocators, HardsHeap supports an extensible framework, making it easy to write a validation logic for each property. Moreover, HardsHeap employs sampling-based testing, which enables us to evaluate a probabilistic mechanism prevalent in secure allocators. To eliminate redundancy in findings from HardsHeap, we devise a new technique called Statistical Significance Delta Debugging (SSDD), which extends the existing delta debugging for stochastically reproducible test cases. We evaluated HardsHeap to 10 secure allocators. Consequently, we found 56 interesting test cases, including several unsecure yet underestimated behaviors for handling large objects in secure allocators. Moreover, we discovered 10 implementation bugs. One of the bugs is integer overflow in secure allocators, making them even more invulnerable than ordinary allocators. Our evaluation also shows that SSDD successfully reduces test cases by 37.2% on average without a loss of reproducibility.",

Typical CGRA architectures contain of multiple instances of the same compute module that consist of simple and general hardware units such as ALUs, simple processors. However, generality in the cell contents, while convenient for serving a wide variety of applications, penalizes performance and energy efficiency. To that end, a few proposed CGRAs use custom logic tailored to a particular application’s specific characteristics in the compute module. This approach, while much more efficient, restricts the versatility of the array. To date, versatility at hardware speeds is only supported with Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), that are reconfigurable at a very fine grain.This work proposes MC-DeF, a novel Mixed-CGRA Definition Framework targeting a Mixed-CGRA architecture that leverages the advantages of CGRAs by utilizing a customized cell array, and those of FPGAs by incorporating a separate LUT array used for adaptability. The framework presented aims to develop a complete CGRA architecture. First, a cell structure and functionality definition phase creates highly customized application/domain specific CGRA cells. Then, mapping and routing phases define the CGRA connectivity and cell-LUT array transactions. Finally, an energy and area estimation phase presents the user with area occupancy and energy consumption estimations of the final design. MC-DeF uses novel algorithms and cost functions driven by user defined metrics, threshold values, and area/energy restrictions. The benefits of our framework, besides creating fast and efficient CGRA designs, include design space exploration capabilities offered to the user.The validity of the presented framework is demonstrated by evaluating and creating CGRA designs of nine applications. Additionally, we provide comparisons of MC-DeF with state-of-the-art related works, and show that MC-DeF offers competitive performance (in terms of internal bandwidth and processing throughput) even compared against much larger designs, and requires fewer physical resources to achieve this level of performance. Finally, MC-DeF is able to better utilize the underlying FPGA fabric and achieves the best efficiency (measured in LUT/GOPs).",

        "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are widespread in critical domains, and significant damage can be caused if an attacker is able to modify the code of their programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Unfortunately, traditional techniques for attesting code integrity (i.e. verifying that it has not been modified) rely on firmware access or roots-of-trust, neither of which proprietary or legacy PLCs are likely to provide. In this paper, we propose a practical code integrity checking solution based on privacy-preserving black box models that instead attest the input/output behaviour of PLC programs. Using faithful offline copies of the PLC programs, we identify their most important inputs through an information flow analysis, execute them on multiple combinations to collect data, then train neural networks able to predict PLC outputs (i.e. actuator commands) from their inputs. By exploiting the black box nature of the model, our solution maintains the privacy of the original PLC code and does not assume that attackers are unaware of its presence. The trust instead comes from the fact that it is extremely hard to attack the PLC code and neural networks at the same time and with consistent outcomes. We evaluated our approach on a modern six-stage water treatment plant testbed, finding that it could predict actuator states from PLC inputs with near-100% accuracy, and thus could detect all 120 effective code mutations that we subjected the PLCs to. Finally, we found that it is not practically possible to simultaneously modify the PLC code and apply discreet adversarial noise to our attesters in a way that leads to consistent (mis-)predictions.",

        "abstract": "A well-known challenge in the semantics of programming languages is how to combine non-determinism and probability. At a technical level, the problem arises from the fact that there is a no distributive law between the powerset monad and the distribution monad --- as noticed some twenty years ago by Plotkin. More recently, it has become clear that there is a distributive law of the multiset monad over the distribution monad. This article elaborates the details of this distributivity and shows that there is a rich underlying theory relating multisets and probability distributions. It is shown that the new distributive law, called parallel multinomial law, can be defined in (at least) four equivalent ways. It involves putting multinomial distributions in parallel and commutes with hypergeometric distributions. Further, it is shown that this distributive law commutes with a new form of zipping for multisets. Abstractly, this can be described in terms of monoidal structure for a fixed-size multiset functor, when lifted to the Kleisli category of the distribution monad. Concretely, an application of the theory to sampling semantics is included.",

This gave rise to the use of process mining in contemporary SRL research to analyse data about temporal and sequential relations of processes that occur in SRL. However, little attention has been paid to the choice and combinations of process mining algorithms to achieve the nuanced needs of SRL research. We present a study that 1) analysed four process mining algorithms that are most commonly used in the SRL literature – Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner, Fuzzy Miner, and pMineR; and 2) examined how the metrics produced by the four algorithms complement each. The study looked at micro-level processes that were extracted from trace data collected in an undergraduate course (N=726). The study found that Fuzzy Miner and pMineR offered better insights into SRL than the other two algorithms. The study also found that a combination of metrics produced by several algorithms improved interpretation of temporal and sequential relations between SRL processes. Thus, it is recommended that future studies of SRL combine the use of process mining algorithms and work on new tools and algorithms specifically created for SRL research.",

The weight is given to the neighboring words in the same semantic segment and propose semantic role labeling position attention based on the bi-directional LSTM model (BLSTM-SRLP).

With the evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication is becoming more prominent for safety and non-safety related applications. The V2V communication facilitates vehicles to interconnect with each other to support numerous applications that will be highly helpful for drivers and passenger's welfare. However, due to the extreme dynamic nature of transportation, the Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) faces many challenges for transferring information among vehicles. Therefore, efficient clustering and dynamic routing are becoming a supreme area of improvement to increase the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and reduce the End-to-End delay for data transfer. In order to overcome the major obstacle, in this paper, we propose an intelligent self-learning approach-based hybrid clustering by integrating Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and dynamic Dijkstra routing for packet transfer between vehicles. Also, experiments were carried out to support the data transfer with the help of drones to provide higher coverage in high dynamic vehicle mobility scenarios. The proposed algorithm is modeled, trained, and tested for performance evaluations metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End to End delay, CH selection delay.",

In practical manual annotation for medical image segmentation tasks, the labels of annotators often show inter-observer variability (IOV) which is mainly caused by annotators’ different understandings of expertise. In order to build a trustworthy segmentation system, robust models should consider how to capture uncertainty in samples and labels. Different from the conventional way of handling IOV with label fusion such as majority voting, a fuzzy integral based ensemble framework of multiple deep learning models for optic disc segmentation is proposed. Each component segmentation model is trained with respect to an annotator. Then, a powerful nonlinear aggregation function, the Choquet integral, is employed in form of a neural network to integrate the segmentation results of multiple annotators. The proposed method is validated on the public RIM-ONE dataset consisting of 169 fundus images and each image is annotated by 5 experts. Compared with conventional segmentation ensemble methods, the proposed methods achieves a higher Dice score (98.69%).",

However, developers or domain experts have different levels of familiarity with specific programming languages, like Solidity, and those vulnerabilities hidden in the code would be exploited and result in huge property losses. Existing auxiliary tools lack security considerations. Most of them only provide word completion based on fuzzy search and detection services for limited types of vulnerabilities, which results in the manpower waste during coding and potential vulnerability threats after deployment.   In this work, we propose an integrated framework to enhance security in the two stages of recommendation and validation, assisting developers to implement more secure contracts more quickly. First, we reinforce original smart contracts with general patch patterns and secure programming standards for training, and design a real-time code suggestion algorithm to predict secure words for selection. Then, we integrate multiple widely-used testing tools to provide validation services. For evaluation, we collected 47,398 real-world contracts, and the result shows that it outperforms existing platforms and tools, improving the average word suggestion accuracy by 30%-60% and helping detect about 25%-61% more vulnerabilities. In most cases, our framework can correctly predict next words with the probability up to 82%-97% within top ten candidates. Compared with professional vulnerability mining tools, it can find more vulnerabilities and provide targeted modification suggestions without frivolous configurations. Currently, this framework has been used as the official development tool of WeBank and integrated as the recommended platform by FISCO-BCOS community.",

To solve the practical problems and fill the theoretical gap, we use a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to study the interaction effects of the flow experience (feeling of immersion and perceived pleasure), technology acceptance model (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use), and customer participation (information sharing and interpersonal interaction) to identify the critical configurations leading to a high level of stickiness in online reading and to verify the complementarity, substitution, and inhibition relationships among these variables.

        "abstract": "With the number of users in crowdsourcing increasing rapidly, task matching service is attracting more and more attention. However, it also causes many security concerns, one of which is the leakage of sensitive information. Privacy-preserving task matching techniques can protect the private information of task requesters and workers. Whereas existing privacy-preserving task matching schemes are constructed on a central server, and thereby they may suffer from potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. In addition, most of them only provide accurate task matching, which means that they cannot tolerate keyword spelling errors, leading to the decline of task matching accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Reliable and Privacy-preserving Task Matching scheme (RPTM) for crowdsourcing. To guarantee the reliability of task matching results, RPTM employs smart contracts to ensure that operations of RPTM are faithfully performed. However, it may still disclose the privacy of users due to the transparency of the blockchain. In order to deal with this problem, RPTM can perform task matching service without compromising the privacy of task requesters and workers by leveraging a novel integer vector encryption scheme.

However, from a research perspective, existing hardware platforms are limited: they are often optimized for concrete, narrow use-cases and, therefore lack the flexibility needed to explore other applications and configurations.   We show that a research group can design and build a more general, open, and affordable hardware platform for hybrid systems research. The platform, Enzian, is capable of duplicating the functionality of existing CPU/FPGA systems with comparable performance but in an open, flexible system. It couples a large FPGA with a server-class CPU in an asymmetric cache-coherent NUMA system. Enzian also enables research not possible with existing hybrid platforms, through explicit access to coherence messages, extensive thermal and power instrumentation, and an open, programmable baseboard management processor.   Enzian is already being used in multiple projects, is open source (both hardware and software), and available for remote use. We present the design principles of Enzian, the challenges in building it, and evaluate it with a range of existing research use-cases alongside other, more specialized platforms, as well as demonstrating research not possible on existing platforms.",

        "abstract": "Rust is a relatively new programming language that has gained significant traction since its v1.0 release in 2015. Rust aims to be a systems language that competes with C/C++. A claimed advantage of Rust is a strong focus on memory safety without garbage collection. This is primarily achieved through two concepts, namely, reference lifetimes and borrowing. Both of these are well-known ideas stemming from the literature on region-based memory management and linearity/uniqueness. Rust brings both of these ideas together to form a coherent programming model. Furthermore, Rust has a strong focus on stack-allocated data and, like C/C++ but unlike Java, permits references to local variables.Type checking in Rust can be viewed as a two-phase process: First, a traditional type checker operates in a flow-insensitive fashion; second, a borrow checker enforces an ownership invariant using a flow-sensitive analysis. In this article, we present a lightweight formalism that captures these two phases using a flow-sensitive type system that enforces “type and borrow safety.” In particular, programs that are type and borrow safe will not attempt to dereference dangling pointers. Our calculus core captures many aspects of Rust, including copy- and move-semantics, mutable borrowing, reborrowing, partial moves, and lifetimes. In particular, it remains sufficiently lightweight to be easily digested and understood and, we argue, still captures the salient aspects of reference lifetimes and borrowing. Furthermore, extensions to the core can easily add more complex features (e.g., control-flow, tuples, method invocation). We provide a soundness proof to verify our key claims of the calculus. We also provide a reference implementation in Java with which we have model checked our calculus using over 500B input programs. We have also fuzz tested the Rust compiler using our calculus against 2B programs and, to date, found one confirmed compiler bug and several other possible issues.",

        "abstract": "The Persistent Memory (PM) technology combines the persistence of storage with the performance approaching that of DRAM. Programs taking advantage of PM must ensure data remains recoverable after a failure (e.g., power outage), and therefore, are susceptible to having crash consistency bugs that lead to incorrect recovery after a failure. Prior works have provided tools, such as Pmemcheck, PMTest, and XFDetector, that detect these bugs by checking whether the trace of PM accesses violates the program’s crash consistency guarantees. However, detection of crash consistency bugs highly depends on test cases—a bug can only be detected if the buggy program path has been executed. Therefore, using a test case generator is necessary to effectively detect crash consistency bugs.   Fuzzing is a common test case generation approach that requires minimum knowledge about the program. We identify that PM programs have special requirements for fuzzing. First, a PM program maintains a persistent state on PM images. Therefore, the fuzzer needs to efficiently generate valid images as part of the test case. Second, these PM images can also be a result of a previous crash, which requires the fuzzer to generate crash images as well. Finally, PM programs can have various procedures but only those performing PM operations can lead to crash consistency issues. Thus, an efficient fuzzer should target those relevant regions. In this work, we provide PMFuzz, a test case generator for PM programs that meets these new requirements. Our evaluation shows that PMFuzz covers 4.6× more PM-related paths compared to AFL++, a widely-used fuzzer. Further, test cases generated by PMFuzz discovered 12 new real-world bugs in PM programs which have already been extensively tested by prior PM testing works.",

Such pairs are metamers relative to each other, just as physically-different spectra of light are perceived as the same color. We propose a real-time method to compute such ventral metamers for foveated rendering where, in particular for near-eye displays, the largest part of the framebuffer maps to the periphery. This improves in quality over state-of-the-art foveation methods which blur the periphery. Work in Vision Science has established how peripheral stimuli are ventral metamers if their statistics are similar. Existing methods, however, require a costly optimization process to find such metamers. To this end, we propose a novel type of statistics particularly well-suited for practical real-time rendering: smooth moments of steerable filter responses. These can be extracted from images in time constant in the number of pixels and in parallel over all pixels using a GPU. Further, we show that they can be compressed effectively and transmitted at low bandwidth. Finally, computing realizations of those statistics can again be performed in constant time and in parallel. This enables a new level of quality for foveated applications such as such as remote rendering, level-of-detail and Monte-Carlo denoising. In a user study, we finally show how human task performance increases and foveation artifacts are less suspicious, when using our method compared to common blurring.",

We observe that if memory allocation sizes (e.g., malloc sizes) are made an architectural feature, then it is possible to overcome many of the thorny issues with traditional approaches to memory safety such as compatibility with unsecured software and significant performance degradation. We show that our architecture, No-FAT, incurs an overhead of 8% on SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks, and our VLSI measurements show low power and area overheads. Finally, as No-FAT's hardware is aware of the memory allocation sizes, it effectively mitigates certain speculative attacks (e.g., Spectre-V1) with no additional cost.

However, the scalability of symbolic execution is often limited by path explosion, i.e., the number of symbolic states representing the paths under exploration quickly explodes as execution goes on. Therefore, the effectiveness of symbolic execution engines hinges on the ability to select and explore the right symbolic states. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based strategy, called Learch, able to effectively select promising states for symbolic execution to tackle the path explosion problem. Learch directly estimates the contribution of each state towards the goal of maximizing coverage within a time budget, as opposed to relying on manually crafted heuristics based on simple statistics as a crude proxy for the objective. Moreover, Learch leverages existing heuristics in training data generation and feature extraction, and can thus benefit from any new expert-designed heuristics. We instantiated Learch in KLEE, a widely adopted symbolic execution engine. We evaluated Learch on a diverse set of programs, showing that Learch is practically effective: it covers more code and detects more security violations than existing manual heuristics, as well as combinations of those heuristics. We also show that using tests generated by Learch as initial fuzzing seeds enables the popular fuzzer AFL to find more paths and security violations.",

In practice today, state machines are either implemented manually at a low level, risking bugs easily missed in audits; or are written using higher-level abstractions like threads, depending on runtime systems that may sacrifice performance or compatibility with the ABIs of important platforms (e.g., resource-constrained IoT systems). We present a compiler-based technique allowing the best of both worlds, coding protocols in a natural high-level form, using freer monads to represent nested coroutines, which are then compiled automatically to lower-level code with explicit state. In fact, our compiler is implemented as a tactic in the Coq proof assistant, structuring compilation as search for an equivalence proof for source and target programs. As such, it is straightforwardly (and soundly) extensible with new hints, for instance regarding new data structures that may be used for efficient lookup of coroutines. As a case study, we implemented a core of TLS sufficient for use with popular Web browsers, and our experiments show that the extracted Haskell code achieves reasonable performance.",

The majority of the existing decision procedures and solvers for these theories are themselves intricate; they are complicated algorithmically, and also have to deal with a very rich vocabulary of operations. This has led to a plethora of bugs in implementation, which have for instance been discovered through fuzzing.  In this paper, we present CertiStr, a certified implementation of a string constraint solver for the theory of strings with concatenation and regular constraints. CertiStr aims to solve string constraints using a forward-propagation algorithm based on symbolic representations of regular constraints as symbolic automata, which returns three results: sat, unsat, and unknown, and is guaranteed to terminate for the string constraints whose concatenation dependencies are acyclic. The implementation has been developed and proven correct in Isabelle/HOL, through which an effective solver in OCaml was generated. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CertiStr against the standard Kaluza benchmark, in which 80.4% tests are in the string constraint fragment of CertiStr. Of these 80.4% tests, CertiStr can solve 83.5% (i.e. CertiStr returns sat or unsat) within 60s.",

        "abstract": "Android, the most popular mobile system, offers a number of user-configurable system settings (e.g., network, location, and permission) for controlling devices and apps. Even popular, well-tested apps may fail to properly adapt their behaviors to diverse setting changes, thus frustrating their users. However, there exists no effort to systematically investigate such defects. To this end, we conduct the first empirical study to understand the characteristics of these setting-related defects (in short as \"setting defects\"), which reside in apps and are triggered by system setting changes. We devote substantial manual effort (over three person-months) to analyze 1,074 setting defects from 180 popular apps on GitHub. We investigate their impact, root causes, and consequences. We find that setting defects have a wide, diverse impact on apps' correctness, and the majority of these defects (≈70.7%) cause non-crash (logic) failures, and thus could not be automatically detected by existing app testing techniques due to the lack of strong test oracles. Motivated and guided by our study, we propose setting-wise metamorphic fuzzing, the first automated testing approach to effectively detect setting defects without explicit oracles. Our key insight is that an app's behavior should, in most cases, remain consistent if a given setting is changed and later properly restored, or exhibit expected differences if not restored. We realize our approach in SetDroid, an automated, end-to-end GUI testing tool, for detecting both crash and non-crash setting defects. SetDroid has been evaluated on 26 popular, open-source apps and detected 42 unique, previously unknown setting defects in 24 apps. To date, 33 have been confirmed and 21 fixed. We also apply SetDroid on five highly popular industrial apps, namely WeChat, QQMail, TikTok, CapCut, and AlipayHK, all of which each have billions of monthly active users. SetDroid successfully detects 17 previously unknown setting defects in these apps' latest releases, and all defects have been confirmed and fixed by the app vendors. The majority of SetDroid-detected defects (49 out of 59) cause non-crash failures, which could not be detected by existing testing tools (as our evaluation confirms). These results demonstrate SetDroid's strong effectiveness and practicality.",

It provides goroutines as lightweight threads and channels for inter-goroutine communication. Programmers are encouraged to explicitly pass messages through channels to connect goroutines, with the purpose of reducing the chance of making programming mistakes and introducing concurrency bugs. Go is one of the most beloved programming languages and has already been used to build many critical infrastructure software systems in the data-center environment. However, a recent study shows that channel-related concurrency bugs are still common in Go programs, severely hurting the reliability of the programs.     This paper presents GFuzz, a dynamic detector that can effectively pinpoint channel-related concurrency bugs by mutating the processing orders of concurrent messages. We build GFuzz in three steps. We first adopt an effective approach to identify concurrent messages and transform a program to process those messages in any given order. We then take a fuzzing approach to generate new processing orders by mutating exercised ones and rely on execution feedback to prioritize orders close to triggering bugs. Finally, we design a runtime sanitizer to capture triggered bugs that are missed by the Go runtime. We evaluate GFuzz on seven popular Go software systems, including Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC. GFuzz finds 184 previously unknown bugs and reports a negligible number of false positives. Programmers have already confirmed 124 reports as real bugs and fixed 67 of them based on our reporting. A careful inspection of the detected concurrency bugs from gRPC shows the effectiveness of each component of GFuzz and confirms the components' rationality.",

Developing rewrite rules can be difficult: rules may be subtly incorrect, profitable rules are easy to miss, and rulesets must be rechecked or extended whenever semantics are tweaked. Large rulesets can also be challenging to apply: redundant rules slow down rule-based search and frustrate debugging. This paper explores how equality saturation, a promising technique that uses e-graphs to apply rewrite rules, can also be used to infer rewrite rules. E-graphs can compactly represent the exponentially large sets of enumerated terms and potential rewrite rules. We show that equality saturation efficiently shrinks both sets, leading to faster synthesis of smaller, more general rulesets. We prototyped these strategies in a tool dubbed Ruler. Compared to a similar tool built on CVC4, Ruler synthesizes 5.8× smaller rulesets 25× faster without compromising on proving power. In an end-to-end case study, we show Ruler-synthesized rules which perform as well as those crafted by domain experts, and addressed a longstanding issue in a popular open source tool.",

A number of coordination protocols such as autonomous intersection management (AIM), adaptive cooperative traffic light control (TLC), cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), among others have been developed with the goal of improving the safety and efficiency of such systems. The overall goal in these systems is to provide behavioral guarantees under the assumption that the participating agents work in concert with a centralized (or distributed) coordinator. While there is work on analyzing such systems from a security perspective, we argue that there is limited work on quantifying trustworthiness of individual agents in a multi-agent system. We propose a framework that uses an epistemic logic to quantify trustworthiness of agents, and embed the use of quantitative trustworthiness values into control and coordination policies. Our modified control policies can help the multi-agent system improve its safety in the presence of untrustworthy agents (and under certain assumptions, including malicious agents). We empirically show the effectiveness of our proposed trust framework by embedding it into AIM, TLC, and CACC platooning algorithms. In our experiments, our trust framework accurately detects attackers in CACC platoons; mitigates the effect of untrustworthy agents in AIM; and trust-aware TLC and AIM reduce collisions in all cases compared to the vanilla versions of these algorithms.",

Because these apps provide convenience and other benefits, as one participant put it, “there is a very fine line” that marks the divide between feeling empowered in the use of technology and coping with the discomfort and creepiness arising from invasive app behavior. Participants consistently expressed being resigned to disclose data even as they accepted personal responsibility for their own privacy. We apply the findings to discuss the limits of empowerment as a design logic for privacy-oriented solutions.",

        "abstract": "Safety compliance is paramount to the safe deployment of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies in real-world transportation systems. As AVs will share road infrastructures with human drivers and pedestrians, it is an important requirement for AVs to obey standard driving rules. Existing AV software testing methods, including simulation and road testing, only check fundamental safety rules such as collision avoidance and safety distance. Scenario-dependent driving rules, including crosswalk and intersection rules, are more complicated because the expected driving behavior heavily depends on the surrounding circumstances. However, a testing framework is missing for checking scenario-dependent driving rules on various AV software.In this paper, we design and implement a systematic framework AVChecker for identifying violations of scenario-dependent driving rules in AV software using formal methods. AVChecker represents both the code logic of AV software and driving rules in proposed formal specifications and leverages satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers to identify driving rule violations. To improve the automation of systematic rule-based checking, AVChecker provides a powerful user interface for writing driving rule specifications and applies static code analysis to extract rule-related code logic from the AV software codebase. Evaluations on two open-source AV software platforms, Baidu Apollo and Autoware, uncover 19 true violations out of 28 real-world driving rules covering crosswalks, traffic lights, stop signs, and intersections. Seven of the violations can lead to severe risks of a collision with pedestrians or blocking traffic.",

An improper treatment, however, can cause serious harm. Here, the decision logic leading to the treatment relies on data obtained from sensors --- an inherently imperfect medium. Coping with these inaccuracies requires the logic to be robust in the sense that slight perturbations in the measurements do not significantly alter the decision. Determining the extent to which an algorithm is robust automatically does not scale well for complex and opaque components. This is particularly problematic when machine learning is involved. Yet, the analysis is feasible for simpler safety-related components such as a runtime monitor, which observes the system and intervenes in a treatment when necessary. Its significantly lower complexity generally allows for providing static guarantees on the runtime behavior of the monitor. Complementing these guarantees with a robustness analysis constitutes a major step toward certifiable medical cyber-physical systems controlled by opaque, machine-learned components. Hence, this paper reports on ongoing research in the direction of a robustness analysis for the runtime monitoring framework RTLola.",

One common approach is to present a query interface to analysts, and anonymize on a query-by-query basis. In practice, this approach often uses a standard database back end, and presents the query semantics of the database to the analyst. This paper presents a class of novel side-channel attacks that work against any query-based anonymization system that uses a standard database back end. The attacks exploit the implicit conditional logic of database runtime optimizations. They manipulate this logic to trigger timing and exception-throwing side-channels based on the contents of the data. We demonstrate the attacks on the implementation of the CHORUS Differential Privacy system released by Uber as an open source project. We obtain perfect reconstruction of millions of data values even with a Differential Privacy budget smaller than epsilon = 1.0 and no prior knowledge. The paper also presents the design of a general defense to the runtime-optimization attacks, and a concrete implementation of the defense in the latest version of Diffix. The defense works without modifications to the back end database, and operates by modifying SQL to eliminate the runtime optimization or disable the side-channels. In addition, two other attacks that exploit specific flaws in Diffix and CHORUS are reported. These have been fixed in the respective implementations.",

However, labeling test inputs to check the correctness of DNN prediction is very costly, which could largely affect the efficiency of DNN testing, even the whole process of DNN development. To relieve the labeling-cost problem, we propose a novel test input prioritization approach (called PRIMA) for DNNs via intelligent mutation analysis in order to label more bug-revealing test inputs earlier for a limited time, which facilitates to improve the efficiency of DNN testing. PRIMA is based on the key insight: a test input that is able to kill many mutated models and produce different prediction results with many mutated inputs, is more likely to reveal DNN bugs, and thus it should be prioritized higher. After obtaining a number of mutation results from a series of our designed model and input mutation rules for each test input, PRIMA further incorporates learning-to-rank (a kind of supervised machine learning to solve ranking problems) to intelligently combine these mutation results for effective test input prioritization. We conducted an extensive study based on 36 popular subjects by carefully considering their diversity from five dimensions (i.e., different domains of test inputs, different DNN tasks, different network structures, different types of test inputs, and different training scenarios). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRIMA, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches (with the average improvement of 8.50%~131.01% in terms of prioritization effectiveness). In particular, we have applied PRIMA to the practical autonomous-vehicle testing in a large motor company, and the results on 4 real-world scene-recognition models in autonomous vehicles further confirm the practicability of PRIMA.",

To reduce verification time Xenon exploits modularity in Verilog code via module summaries, thereby avoiding duplicate work across multiple module instantiations. We show how Xenon's assumption synthesis and summaries enable us to verify different kinds of circuits, including a highly modular AES- 256 implementation where modularity cuts verification from six hours to under three seconds, and the ScarVside-channel hardened RISC-V micro-controller whose size exceeds previously verified designs by an order of magnitude.

Our approach adopts deep reinforcement learning techniques to interact with the CPS under test and effectively searches for failure-inducing input guided by rewards. Our approach adaptively collects information from the CPS, which reduces the training time and is also able to explore different states. Moreover, our approach is the first attempt to generate failure-inducing input for CPSs with both continuous action space and high-dimensional discrete action space, which are common for some classes of CPSs. The evaluation results show that FIGCPS not only achieves a higher success rate than the state-of-the-art approaches but also finds two new attacks in a well-tested CPS.",

This can be a non-trivial process -- if not done carefully, the algorithm might either violate differential privacy or have low utility. In this paper, we present DPGen, a program synthesizer that takes in non-private code (without any noise) and automatically synthesizes its differentially private version (with carefully calibrated noise). Under the hood, DPGen uses novel algorithms to automatically generate a sketch program with candidate locations for noise, and then optimize privacy proof and noise scales simultaneously on the sketch program. Moreover, DPGen can synthesize sophisticated mechanisms that adaptively process queries until a specified privacy budget is exhausted. When evaluated on standard benchmarks, DPGen is able to generate differentially private mechanisms that optimize simple utility functions within 120 seconds. It is also powerful enough to synthesize adaptive privacy mechanisms.",

In contrast, hardware bugs that are found after fabrication are extremely costly to fix (and sometimes even unfixable), so the traditional hardware development cycle involves massive investment in extensive simulation and formal verification. Reconfigurable hardware, such as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), promises to propel hardware development towards an agile software-like development approach, since it enables a hardware developer to patch bugs that are detected during on-chip testing or in production. Unfortunately, FPGA programmers lack bug localization tools amenable to this rapid development cycle, since past tools mainly find bugs via simulation and verification. To develop hardware bug localization tools for a rapid development cycle, a thorough understanding of the symptoms, root causes, and fixes of hardware bugs is needed.   In this paper, we first study bugs in existing FPGA designs and produce a testbed of reliably-reproducible bugs. We classify the bugs according to their intrinsic properties, symptoms, and root causes. We demonstrate that many hardware bugs are comparable to software bug counterparts, and would benefit from similar techniques for bug diagnosis and repair. Based upon our findings, we build a novel collection of hybrid static/dynamic program analysis and monitoring tools for debugging FPGA designs, showing that our tools enable a software-like development cycle by effectively reducing developers' manual efforts for bug localization.",

Flaws in X.509 implementations can make relying applications susceptible to impersonation attacks or interoperability issues. In practice, many libraries implementing X.509 have been shown to suffer from flaws that are due to noncompliance with the standard. Developing a compliant implementation is especially hindered by the design complexity, ambiguities, or under-specifications in the standard written in natural languages. In this paper, we set out to alleviate this unsatisfactory state of affairs by re-engineering and formalizing a widely used fragment of the X.509 standard specification, and then using it to develop a high-assurance implementation. Our X.509 specification re-engineering effort is guided by the principle of decoupling the syntactic requirements from the semantic requirements. For formalizing the syntactic requirements of X.509 standard, we observe that a restricted fragment of attribute grammar is sufficient. In contrast, for precisely capturing the semantic requirements imposed on the most-widely used X.509 features, we use quantifier-free first-order logic (QFFOL). Interestingly, using QFFOL results in an executable specification that can be efficiently enforced by an SMT solver. We use these and other insights to develop a high-assurance X.509 implementation named CERES. A comparison of CERES with 3 mainstream libraries (i.e., mbedTLS, OpenSSL, and GnuTLS) based on 2 million real certificate chains and 2 million synthetic certificate chains shows that CERES rightfully rejects malformed and invalid certificates.",

        "abstract": "RPCs are fundamental to our large-scale distributed system. From a security perspective, the blast radius of RPCs is worryingly big since each RPC often interacts with tens of internal system components. Thus, discovering RPC vulnerabilities is often a top priority in the software quality assurance process for production systems. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and deployment experiences of PAIR, a fully automated system for privilege-escalation vulnerability discovery in Ant Group's large-scale RPC system. The design of PAIR centers around the live replay design principle where the vulnerability discovery is driven by the live RPC requests collected from production, rather than relying on any engineered testing requests. This ensures that PAIR is able to provide complete coverage to our production RPC requests in a privacy-preserving manner, despite the manifest of scale (billions of daily requests), complexity (hundreds of system-services involved) and heterogeneity (RPC protocols are highly customized). However, the live replay design principle is not a panacea. We made a couple of critical design decisions (and addressed their corresponding challenges) along the way to realize the principle in production. First, to avoid inspecting the responses of user-facing RPCs (due to privacy concerns), PAIR designs a universal and privacy-preserving mechanism, via profiling the end-to-end system invocation, to represent the RPC handling logic. Second, to ensure that PAIR provides proactive defense (rather than reactive defense that is often limited by known vulnerabilities), PAIR designs an empirical vulnerability labeling mechanism to effectively identify a group of potentially insecure RPCs while safely excluding other RPCs. During the course of three-year production development, PAIR in total helped locate 133 truly insecure RPCs, from billions of requests, while maintaining a zero false negative rate per our production observations.",

        "abstract": "Data-flow programming is the computational model of choice for a large class of application domains, such as, real-time data processing, robotics platforms, and big-data analytics. Traditionally, dataflows are deployed and executed within well-defined system boundaries, such as robots, radars, or data-centers. These boundaries however are expected to blur with the advent of Edge Computing, which provides a multi-tier infrastructure spanning from the cloud to the things and enables for the distribution of applications across this continuum. In this paper we make a step towards the design of an Edge-native data-flow by mixing technologies coming from both worlds: ERDOS, a novel data-flow framework, and Eclipse Zenoh, a Named-Data-Networking built for the Edge Computing. More specifically, we (i) investigate how ERDOS can be expanded to cover Edge deployments by leveraging Zenoh, (ii) analyze the advantages provided by this integration, and (iii) evaluate the performance of a Zenoh-powered ERDOS. Our results show that ERDOS experiences a higher throughput and bounded latency when operating over Zenoh. Moreover, Zenoh enhances ERDOS with full location transparency, allowing developers and system designers to focus on the logic of their application as opposed to the topology deployment. Finally, our integration of Zenoh and ERDOS is available as open source at https://github.com/atolab/erdos-on-zenoh.",

SQL offers a wide range of functionalities to summarize data such as associative aggregates, distinct aggregates, ordered-set aggregates, grouping sets, and window functions. In this work, we propose a unified framework for advanced statistics that composes all flavors of complex SQL aggregates from low-level plan operators. These operators can reuse materialized intermediate results, which decouples monolithic aggregation logic and speeds up complex multi-expression queries. The contribution is therefore twofold: our framework modularizes aggregate implementations, and outperforms traditional systems whenever multiple aggregates are combined. We integrated our approach into the high-performance database system Umbra and experimentally show that we compute complex aggregates faster than the state-of-the-art HyPer system.",

        "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) systems become pervasive, safeguarding their security is critical. However, recently it has been demonstrated that motivated adversaries are able to mislead ML systems by perturbing test data using semantic transformations. While there exists a rich body of research providing provable robustness guarantees for ML models against Lp bounded adversarial perturbations, guarantees against semantic perturbations remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we provide TSS-a unified framework for certifying ML robustness against general adversarial semantic transformations. First, depending on the properties of each transformation, we divide common transformations into two categories, namely resolvable (e.g., Gaussian blur) and differentially resolvable (e.g., rotation) transformations. For the former, we propose transformation-specific randomized smoothing strategies and obtain strong robustness certification. The latter category covers transformations that involve interpolation errors, and we propose a novel approach based on stratified sampling to certify the robustness. Our framework TSS leverages these certification strategies and combines with consistency-enhanced training to provide rigorous certification of robustness. We conduct extensive experiments on over ten types of challenging semantic transformations and show that TSS significantly outperforms the state of the art. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, TSS is the first approach that achieves nontrivial certified robustness on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. For instance, our framework achieves 30.4% certified robust accuracy against rotation attack (within ±30°) on ImageNet. Moreover, to consider a broader range of transformations, we show TSS is also robust against adaptive attacks and unforeseen image corruptions such as CIFAR-10-C and ImageNet-C.",

Therefore, HPC applications need to be evaluated (e.g., via fault injections) and protected to meet the reliability target. In the evaluation, the target programs exercise with a set of given inputs which are usually from program benchmark suite. However, these inputs rarely manifest the SDC vulnerabilities, leading to over-optimistic assessment and unexpectedly higher failure rates in production. We propose Peppa-X, which efficiently identifies the test inputs that estimate the bound of program SDC resiliency. Our key insight is that the SDC sensitivity distribution in a program often remains stationary across input space. Thereby, we can guide the search of SDC-bound inputs by a sampled distribution. Our evaluation shows that Peppa-X can identify the SDC-bound input of a program that existing methods cannot find even with 5x more search time.",

        "abstract": "Fork has long been the process creation system call for Unix. At its inception, fork was hailed as an efficient system call due to its use of copy-on-write on memory shared between parent and child processes. However, application memory demand has increased drastically since the early days and the cost incurred by fork to simply set up virtual memory (e.g., copy page tables) is now a concern, even for applications that only require hundreds of MBs of memory. In practice, fork performance already holds back system efficiency and latency across a range of uses cases that fork large processes, such as fault-tolerant systems, serverless frameworks, and testing frameworks. This paper proposes On-demand-fork, a fast implementation of the fork system call specifically designed for applications with large memory footprints. On-demand-fork relies on the observation that copy-on-write can be generalized to page tables, even on commodity hardware. On-demand-fork executes faster than the traditional fork implementation by additionally sharing page tables between parent and child at fork time and selectively copying page tables in small chunks, on-demand, when handling page faults. On-demand-fork is a drop-in replacement for fork that requires no changes to applications or hardware. We evaluated On-demand-fork on a range of micro-benchmarks and real-world workloads. On-demand-fork significantly reduces the fork invocation time and has improved scalability. For processes with 1 GB of allocated memory, On-demand-fork has a 65× performance advantage over Fork. We also evaluated On-demand-fork on testing, fuzzing, and snapshotting workloads of well-known applications, obtaining execution throughput improvements between 59% and 226% and up to 99% invocation latency reduction.",

Data-dependent functions are required to be invoked following a pre-defined logic, which is known as serverless workflows. However, our investigation shows that the traditional master-worker based workflow execution architecture performs poorly in serverless context. One significant overhead results from the master-side workflow schedule pattern, with which the functions are triggered in the master node and assigned to worker nodes for execution. Besides, the data movement between workers also reduces the throughput.  To this end, we present a worker-side workflow schedule pattern for serverless workflow execution. Following the design, we implement FaaSFlow to enable efficient workflow execution in the serverless context. Besides, we propose an adaptive storage library FaaStore that enables fast data transfer between functions on the same node without through the database. Experiment results show that FaaSFlow effectively mitigates the workflow scheduling overhead by 74.6% on average and data transmission overhead by 95% at most. When the network bandwidth fluctuates, FaaSFlow-FaaStore reduces the throughput degradation by 23.0%, and is able to multiply the utilization of network bandwidth by 1.5X-4X.",

We unveil tight connections between information theory and the conjunctive query containment under bag semantics. These connections are established using information inequalities, which are considered to be the laws of information theory. Our first main result asserts that deciding the validity of a generalization of information inequalities is many-one equivalent to the restricted case of conjunctive query containment in which the containing query is acyclic; thus, either both these problems are decidable or both are undecidable. Our second main result identifies a new decidable case of the conjunctive query containment problem under bag semantics.

        "abstract": "To reduce the development costs, IoT vendors tend to construct IoT kernels by customizing the Linux kernel. Code pruning is common in this customization process. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of the Linux kernel and the lack of long-term effective maintenance, IoT vendors may mistakenly delete necessary security operations in the pruning process, which leads to various bugs such as memory leakage and NULL pointer dereference. Yet detecting bugs caused by code pruning in IoT kernels is difficult. Specifically, (1) a significant structural change makes precisely locating the deleted security operations (DSO ) difficult, and (2) inferring the security impact of a DSO is not trivial since it requires complex semantic understanding, including the developing logic and the context of the corresponding IoT kernel. In this paper, we present CPscan, a system for automatically detecting bugs caused by code pruning in IoT kernels. First, using a new graph-based approach that iteratively conducts a structure-aware basic block matching, CPscan can precisely and efficiently identify theDSOs in IoT kernels. Then, CPscan infers the security impact of a DSO by comparing the bounded use chains (where and how a variable is used within potentially influenced code segments) of the security-critical variable associated with it. Specifically, CPscan reports the deletion of a security operation as vulnerable if the bounded use chain of the associated security-critical variable remains the same before and after the deletion. This is because the unchanged uses of a security-critical variable likely need the security operation, and removing it may have security impacts. The experimental results on 28 IoT kernels from 10 popular IoT vendors show that CPscan is able to identify 3,193DSO s and detect 114 new bugs with a reasonably low false-positive rate. Many such bugs tend to have a long latent period (up to 9 years and 5 months). We believe CPscan paves a way for eliminating the bugs introduced by code pruning in IoT kernels. We will open-source CPscan to facilitate further research.",

Unlike the program bytecode whose vulnerabilities and threats have been widely-discussed, whether and how the deep learning models deployed in the applications can be compromised are not well-understood since neural networks are usually viewed as a black box. In this paper, we introduce a highly practical backdoor attack achieved with a set of reverse-engineering techniques over compiled deep learning models. The core of the attack is a neural conditional branch constructed with a trigger detector and several operators and injected into the victim model as a malicious payload. The attack is effective as the conditional logic can be flexibly customized by the attacker, and scalable as it does not require any prior knowledge from the original model. We evaluated the attack effectiveness using 5 state-of-the-art deep learning models and real-world samples collected from 30 users. The results demonstrated that the injected backdoor can be triggered with a success rate of 93.5%, while only brought less than 2ms latency overhead and no more than 1.4% accuracy decrease. We further conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play. We found 54 apps that were vulnerable to our attack, including popular and security-critical ones.

        "abstract": "The theory of program modules is of interest to language designers not only for its practical importance to programming, but also because it lies at the nexus of three fundamental concerns in language design: the phase distinction, computational effects, and type abstraction. We contribute a fresh “synthetic” take on program modules that treats modules as the fundamental constructs, in which the usual suspects of prior module calculi (kinds, constructors, dynamic programs) are rendered as derived notions in terms of a modal type-theoretic account of the phase distinction. We simplify the account of type abstraction (embodied in the generativity of module functors) through a lax modality that encapsulates computational effects, placing projectibility of module expressions on a type-theoretic basis. Our main result is a (significant) proof-relevant and phase-sensitive generalization of the Reynolds abstraction theorem for a calculus of program modules, based on a new kind of logical relation called a parametricity structure. Parametricity structures generalize the proof-irrelevant relations of classical parametricity to proof-relevant families, where there may be non-trivial evidence witnessing the relatedness of two programs—simplifying the metatheory of strong sums over the collection of types, for although there can be no “relation classifying relations,” one easily accommodates a “family classifying small families.” Using the insight that logical relations/parametricity is itself a form of phase distinction between the syntactic and the semantic, we contribute a new synthetic approach to phase separated parametricity based on the slogan logical relations as types, by iterating our modal account of the phase distinction. We axiomatize a dependent type theory of parametricity structures using two pairs of complementary modalities (syntactic, semantic) and (static, dynamic), substantiated using the topos theoretic Artin gluing construction. Then, to construct a simulation between two implementations of an abstract type, one simply programs a third implementation whose type component carries the representation invariant.",

Furthermore, making such a design approach suitable for real-time embedded systems requires the need for extending the standard DPR design flow with additional design steps, which have to accurately account for the timing behavior of the software and hardware components of the design, as well as of the components of the computing platform (e.g., the reconfiguration interface). To address this problem, this paper presents DART, a tool that fully automates the design flow in a real-time DPR-based system that comprises both software and hardware components. The tool targets the Zynq 7-series and Ultrascale+ FPGA-based SoCs by Xilinx. It aims at alleviating the manual effort required by state-of-the-art tools while not expecting high expertise in the design of programmable logic components under DPR. To this purpose, it fully automates the partitioning, floorplanning, and implementation (routing and bitstream generation) phases, generating a set of bitstreams starting from a set of tasks annotated with high-level timing requirements. The tool leverages mathematical optimization to solve the partitioning and floorplanning problems, and relies on a set of auto-generated scripts that interact with the vendor tools to mobilize the synthesis and implementation stages.

We locate a huge number of inconsistent instruction streams (171,858 for QEMU, 223,264 for unicorn, and 120,169 for Angr). We find that undefined implementation in ARM manual and bugs of emulators are the major causes of inconsistencies. Furthermore, we discover 12 bugs, which influence commonly used instructions (e.g., BLX). With the inconsistent instructions, we build three security applications and demonstrate the capability of these instructions on detecting emulators, anti-emulation, and anti-fuzzing.",

        "abstract": "Recommender systems have been upgraded, tested, and applied in many, often incomparable ways. In attempts to diligently understand user behavior in certain environments, those systems have been frequently utilized in domains like e-commerce, e-learning, and tourism. Their increasing need and popularity have allowed the existence of numerous research paths on major issues like data sparsity, cold start, malicious noise, and natural noise, which immensely limit their performance. It is typical that the quality of the data that fuel those systems should be extremely reliable. Inconsistent user information in datasets can alter the performance of recommenders, albeit running advanced personalizing algorithms. The consequences of this can be costly as such systems are employed in abundant online businesses. Successfully managing these inconsistencies results in more personalized user experiences. In this article, the previous works conducted on natural noise management in recommender datasets are thoroughly analyzed. We adequately explore the ways in which the proposed methods measure improved performances and touch on the different natural noise management techniques and the attributes of the solutions. Additionally, we test the evaluation methods employed to assess the approaches and discuss several key gaps and other improvements the field should realize in the future. Our work considers the likelihood of a modern research branch on natural noise management and recommender assessment.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic analysis based on the full-system emulator QEMU is widely used for various purposes.However, it is challenging to run firmware images of embedded devices in QEMU, especially the process to boot the Linux kernel (we call this process rehosting the Linux kernel in this paper). That's because embedded devices usually use different system-on-chips (SoCs) from multiple vendors and only a limited number of SoCs are currently supported in QEMU. In this work, we propose a technique called peripheral transplantation. The main idea is to transplant the device drivers of designated peripherals into the Linux kernel binary. By doing so, it can replace the peripherals in the kernel that are currently unsupported in QEMU with supported ones, thus making the Linux kernel rehostable. After that, various applications can be built. We implemented this technique inside a prototype system called ECMO and applied it to 815 firmware images, which consist of 20 kernel versions and 37 device models. The result shows that ECMO can successfully transplant peripherals for all the 815 Linux kernels. Among them, 710 kernels can be successfully rehosted, i.e., launching a user-space shell (87.1% success rate). The failed cases are mainly because the root file system format (ramfs) is not supported by the kernel. Meanwhile, we are able to inject rather complex drivers (i.e., NIC driver) for all the rehosted Linux kernels by installing kernel modules. We further build three applications, i.e., kernel crash analysis, rootkit forensic analysis, and kernel fuzzing, based on the rehosted kernels to demonstrate the usage scenarios of ECMO.",

Alas, existing bug reproduction approaches are not suitable for production systems because they are not simultaneously efficient, effective, and accurate. In this work, we survey prior techniques and show that existing approaches over-prioritize a subset of these properties, and sacrifice the remaining ones. As a result, existing tools do not enable the plethora of proposed failure reproduction use-cases (e.g., debugging, security forensics, fuzzing) for production failures.   We propose Execution Reconstruction (ER), a technique that strikes a better balance between efficiency, effectiveness and accuracy for reproducing production failures. ER uses hardware-assisted control and data tracing to shepherd symbolic execution and reproduce failures. ER’s key novelty lies in identifying data values that are both inexpensive to monitor and useful for eliding the scalability limitations of symbolic execution. ER harnesses failure reoccurrences by iteratively performing tracing and symbolic execution, which reduces runtime overhead. Whereas prior production-grade techniques can only reproduce short executions, ER can reproduce any reoccuring failure. Thus, unlike existing tools, ER reproduces fully replayable executions that can power a variety of debugging and reliabilty use cases. ER incurs on average 0.3% (up to 1.1%) runtime monitoring overhead for a broad range of real-world systems, making it practical for real-world deployment.",

        "abstract": "A great part of software development involves conceptualizing or communicating the underlying procedures and logic that needs to be expressed in programs. One major difficulty of programming is turning concept into code, especially when dealing with the APIs of unfamiliar libraries. Recently, there has been a proliferation of machine learning methods for code generation and retrieval from natural language queries, but these have primarily been evaluated purely based on retrieval accuracy or overlap of generated code with developer-written code, and the actual effect of these methods on the developer workflow is surprisingly unattested. In this article, we perform the first comprehensive investigation of the promise and challenges of using such technology inside the PyCharm IDE, asking, “At the current state of technology does it improve developer productivity or accuracy, how does it affect the developer experience, and what are the remaining gaps and challenges?” To facilitate the study, we first develop a plugin for the PyCharm IDE that implements a hybrid of code generation and code retrieval functionality, and we orchestrate virtual environments to enable collection of many user events (e.g., web browsing, keystrokes, fine-grained code edits). We ask developers with various backgrounds to complete 7 varieties of 14 Python programming tasks ranging from basic file manipulation to machine learning or data visualization, with or without the help of the plugin. While qualitative surveys of developer experience are largely positive, quantitative results with regards to increased productivity, code quality, or program correctness are inconclusive. Further analysis identifies several pain points that could improve the effectiveness of future machine learning-based code generation/retrieval developer assistants and demonstrates when developers prefer code generation over code retrieval and vice versa. We release all data and software to pave the road for future empirical studies on this topic, as well as development of better code generation models.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning(DL) techniques attract people from various fields with superior performance in making progressive breakthroughs. To ensure the quality of DL techniques, researchers have been working on testing and verification approaches. Some recent studies reveal that the underlying DL operators could cause defects inside a DL model. DL operators work as fundamental components in DL libraries. Library developers still work on practical approaches to ensure the quality of operators they provide. However, the variety of DL operators and the implementation complexity make it challenging to evaluate their quality. Operator testing with limited test cases may fail to reveal hidden defects inside the implementation. Besides, the existing model-to-library testing approach requires extra labor and time cost to identify and locate errors, i.e., developers can only react to the exposed defects. This paper proposes a fuzzing-based operator-level precision testing approach to estimate individual DL operators' precision errors to bridge this gap. Unlike conventional fuzzing techniques, valid shape variable inputs and fine-grained precision error evaluation are implemented. The testing of DL operators is treated as a searching problem to maximize output precision errors. We implement our approach in a tool named Predoo and conduct an experiment on seven DL operators from TensorFlow. The experiment result shows that Predoo can trigger larger precision errors compared to the error threshold declared in the testing scripts from the TensorFlow repository.",

We identify that the ways Markdown compilers handle the language's context-sensitive features are the dominant root cause of performance bugs. To detect unknown performance bugs, we develop MdPerfFuzz, a fuzzing framework with a syntax-tree based mutation strategy to efficiently generate test cases to manifest such bugs. It equips an execution trace similarity algorithm to de-duplicate the bug reports. With MdPerfFuzz, we successfully identified 216 new performance bugs in real-world Markdown compilers and applications. Our work demonstrates that the performance bugs are a common, severe, yet previously overlooked security problem.",

        "abstract": "Recent research shows that, even for vulnerability reports archived by MITRE/NIST, they usually contain incomplete information about the software's vulnerable versions, making users of under-reported vulnerable versions at risk. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a fuzzing-based method. Technically, this approach first collects the crashing trace on the reference version of the software. Then, it utilizes the trace to guide the mutation of the PoC input so that the target version could follow the trace similar to the one observed on the reference version. Under the mutated input, we argue that the target version's execution could have a higher chance of triggering the bug and demonstrating the vulnerability's existence. We implement this idea as an automated tool, named VulScope. Using 30 real-world CVEs on 470 versions of software, VulScope is demonstrated to introduce no false positives and only 7.9% false negatives while migrating PoC from one version to another. Besides, we also compare our method with two representative fuzzing tools AFL and AFLGO. We find VulScope outperforms both of these existing techniques while taking the task of PoC migration. Finally, by using VulScope, we identify 330 versions of software that MITRE/NIST fails to report as vulnerable.",

The MADM approach can address the multi-objective decision making issues effectively. However, when the parameters vary greatly, the traditional MADM algorithm is not effective anymore. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose the pairwise-based MADM algorithm. In the PMADM, only two nodes&#x2019; utilities are calculated and compared at each time. The PMADM algorithm is much more accurate than the traditional MADM algorithm. Moreover, we also prove that the PMADM algorithm is sensitive to the parameters which vary seriously and insensitive to the parameters which change slightly. This property is better than that of the traditional MADM algorithm. Additionally, the PMADM algorithm is more stable than traditional MADM algorithm. For reducing the computational complexity of the PMADM algorithm, we propose the low-complexity PMADM algorithm. For analyzing the computational complexity of the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${l}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> PMADM algorithm, we propose the tree-based decomposing algorithm in this paper.

Elective courses are usually chosen based on the student’s interests and abilities as well as the experiences of other students. This research focuses on building a web-based elective courses recommendation system using genetic algorithms. The genetic algorithm is utilized to filter all the elective courses into ten elective courses. The set of ten candidates of recommended elective courses is considered as a chromosome of an individual. The recommended elective courses are given based on user profiles. The user profile consists of three factors, i.e., interest in courses, student’s grades, and student’s research interest. The fitness function of an individual is defined as the sum of all scores for all recommendation factors. This research used Curriculum 2016 of the Computer Science Bachelor Program for validation purposes. The proposed recommendation system is evaluated in two ways, i.e., questionnaire method and validation method. The questionnaire method obtains an assessment of system performance, hence the validation method to get the average accuracy. The questionnaire was conducted by involving thirty students of the CSUGM undergraduate program. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation system has a good performance proven by the percentage of recommendation relevancy on 4.67 of 5. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed recommendation system has an average of 74.08 %.",

        "abstract": "Sensor platforms used in environmental monitoring applications are often subject to harsh environmental conditions while monitoring complex phenomena. Therefore, designing dependable monitoring systems is challenging given the external disturbances affecting sensor measurements. Even the apparently simple task of outlier detection in sensor data becomes a hard problem, amplified by the difficulty in distinguishing true data errors due to sensor faults from deviations due to natural phenomenon, which look like data errors. Existing solutions for runtime outlier detection typically assume that the physical processes can be accurately modeled, or that outliers consist in large deviations that are easily detected and filtered by appropriate thresholds. Other solutions assume that it is possible to deploy multiple sensors providing redundant data to support voting-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new methodology for dependable runtime detection of outliers in environmental monitoring systems, aiming to increase data quality by treating them. We propose the use of machine learning techniques to model each sensor behavior, exploiting the existence of correlated data provided by other related sensors. Using these models, along with knowledge of processed past measurements, it is possible to obtain accurate estimations of the observed environment parameters and build failure detectors that use these estimations. When a failure is detected, these estimations also allow one to correct the erroneous measurements and hence improve the overall data quality. Our methodology not only allows one to distinguish truly abnormal measurements from deviations due to complex natural phenomena, but also allows the quantification of each measurement quality, which is relevant from a dependability perspective.We apply the methodology to real datasets from a complex aquatic monitoring system, measuring temperature and salinity parameters, through which we illustrate the process for building the machine learning prediction models using a technique based on Artificial Neural Networks, denoted ANNODE (ANN Outlier Detection). From this application, we also observe the effectiveness of our ANNODE approach for accurate outlier detection in harsh environments. Then we validate these positive results by comparing ANNODE with state-of-the-art solutions for outlier detection. The results show that ANNODE improves existing solutions regarding accuracy of outlier detection.",

Therefore, the combination of data mining algorithms and IoT technology is the development trend of data processing in the future, but because of the difficulty, not all algorithms can be implemented on the cloud platform, so the research results are not enough. The core idea of cloud computing is architecture. All data mining algorithm improvement strategies need to be designed according to the characteristics of the architecture, and each part must implement specific functions. It is difficult or impossible to implement an algorithm that cannot be decomposed into the above form in the architecture. With the widespread application of IoT technology, a large number of unstructured, distributed and even data mining requirements in mobile devices pose serious challenges to existing data mining technologies. How to use cloud computing technology to achieve large-scale distributed data collection, transmission and mining has become an important research direction.

This artifact can quickly become too complex, which makes it challenging to maintain an SPL. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the artifact's maintainability continuously. The literature brings some approaches that evaluate FM maintainability through the aggregation of maintainability measures. Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to create these approaches. They can aggregate the values of independent variables into a single target data, also called a dependent variable. Besides, when using white-box ML models, it is possible to interpret and explain the ML model results. This work proposes white-box ML models intending to classify the FM maintainability based on 15 measures. To build the models, we performed the following steps: (i) we compared two approaches to evaluate the FM maintainability through a human-based oracle of FM maintainability classifications; (ii) we used the best approach to pre-classify the ML training dataset; (iii) we generated three ML models and compared them against classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC-ROC; and, (iv) we used the best model to create a mechanism capable of providing improvement indicators to domain engineers. The best model used the decision tree algorithm that obtained accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.81, F1-Score of 0.79, and AUC-ROC of 0.91. Using this model, we could reduce the number of measures needed to evaluate the FM maintainability from 15 to 9 measures.",

        "abstract": "Due to the subjectiveness and fuzziness of emotions in texts, researchers have been aware that it is ubiquitous to observe multiple emotions in a sentence, and the one-hot label approach is not informative enough in emotion-relevant text classification tasks. Therefore, to facilitate the classification task, recent works focus on generating and employing a coarse-grained emotion distribution, which is based on coarse-grained labels provided by the underlying dataset. Although such methods can alleviate the problem of overfitting and improve robustness, they may cause inter-class confusion between similar emotion categories and introduce undesirable noise during training. Meanwhile, current studies neglect the fine-grained emotions associated with these coarse-grained labels. To address the issue caused by utilizing a coarse-grained distribution, we propose in this paper a general and novel emotion label extension method based on fine-grained emotions. Specifically, we first identify a mapping function between coarse-grained emotions and fine-grained emotion concepts, and extend the original label space with specific fine-grained emotions. Then, we generate a fine-grained emotion distribution by employing a rule-based method, and utilize it as a model constraint to incorporate the dependencies among fine-grained emotions to predict the original coarse-grained emotion labels. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed label extension method. The results indicate that our proposed method can produce notable improvements over baseline models on the applied datasets.",

Therefore, Irrigation management is an important and innovative field that has been the subject of several types of research and studies to deal with the different activities, behaviors, and conflicts between the different users. This article presents a methodology for developing an intelligent irrigation system that determines the water requirement of each farm according to the water loss due to the process of evapotranspiration. The water requirement is calculated from data collected from a series of sensors installed in the plantation farm. This project focuses on smart irrigation based on IoT that is effective and can be used by farmer associations whose endowments and irrigation planning are defined according to the need and quantity of water available in the rural municipality. The system includes a microcontroller with the integration of sensors, actuators, and valve modules where each node serves as an IoT device. The environmental parameters are monitored directly through a multi-agent system which facilitates the control of each node and the configuration parameters for irrigation. The amount of water calculated for irrigation is based on the Penman model for calculating the daily benchmark for evapotranspiration. Compared to the conventional irrigation method, it is expected that the proposed irrigation model would help save water use and distribute it impartially without compromising its production.",

        "abstract": "This article describes and discusses railway-traffic simulators that use reflective nested simulations. Such simulations support optimizations (decision-making) with a focus on the selection of the most suitable solution where selected types of traffic problems are present.This approach allows suspension of the ongoing main simulation at a given moment and, by using supportive nested simulations (working with an appropriate lookahead), assessment of the different acceptable solution variants for the problem encountered—that is, a what-if analysis is carried out. The variant that provides the best predicted operational results (based on a specific criterion) is then selected for continuing the suspended main simulation. The proposed procedures are associated, in particular, with the use of sequential simulators specifically developed for railway traffic simulations. Special attention is paid to parallel computations of replications both of the main simulation and of supportive nested simulations.The concept proposed, applicable to railway traffic modelling, has the following advantages. First, the solution variants for the existing traffic situation are analyzed with respect to the feasibility of direct monitoring and evaluation of the natural traffic indicators or the appropriate (multi-criterial) function. The indicator values compare the results obtained from the variants being tested. Second, the supporting nested simulations, which potentially use additional hierarchic nesting, can also include future occurrences of random effects (such as train delay), thereby enabling us to realistically assess future traffic in stochastic conditions.The guidelines presented (for exploiting nested simulations within application projects with time constraints) are illustrated on a simulation case study focusing on traffic assessment related to the track infrastructure of a passenger railway station. Nested simulations support decisions linked with dynamic assignments of platform tracks to delayed trains.The use of reflective nested simulations is appropriate particularly in situations in which a reasonable number of admissible variants are to be analyzed within decision-making problem solution. This method is applicable especially to the support of medium-term (tactical) and long-term (strategic) planning. Because of rather high computational and time demands, nested simulations are not recommended for solving short-term (operative) planning/control problems.",

This model of computation draws a new trust boundary between virtual devices and the VM, which in so far lacks thorough examination. In this paper, we therefore present an analysis of the virtual device interface and discuss several attack vectors against a protected VM. Further, we develop and evaluate VIA, an automated analysis tool to detect cases of improper sanitization of input recieved via the virtual device interface. VIA improves upon existing approaches for the automated analysis of device interfaces in the following aspects: (i) support for virtualization relevant buses, (ii) efficient Direct Memory Access (DMA) support and (iii) performance. VIA builds upon the Linux Kernel Library and clang’s libfuzzer to fuzz the communication between the driver and the device via MMIO, PIO, and DMA. An evaluation of VIA shows that it performs 570 executions per second on average and improves performance compared to existing approaches by an average factor of 2706. Using VIA, we analyzed 22 drivers in Linux 5.10.0-rc6, thereby uncovering 50 bugs and initiating multiple patches to the virtual device driver interface of Linux. To prove our findings’ criticality under the threat model of AMD SEV and Intel TDX, we showcase three exemplary attacks based on the bugs found.

This is not surprising given the uncertainty that underlies this activity. This work studies the use of Monte Carlo simulations for generating forecasts based on project historical data. We have designed and run experiments comparing these forecasts against what happened in practice and to estimates provided by developers, when available. Comparisons were made based on the mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE). We did also analyze how the forecasting accuracy varies with the amount of work to be forecasted and the amount of historical data used. To minimize the requirements on input data, delivery date forecasts for a set of user stories were computed based on takt time of past stories (time elapsed between the completion of consecutive stories); effort forecasts were computed based on full-time equivalent (FTE) hours allocated to the implementation of past stories. The MMRE of delivery date forecasting was 32% in a set of 10 runs (for different projects) of Monte Carlo simulation based on takt time. The MMRE of effort forecasting was 20% in a set of 5 runs of Monte Carlo simulation based on FTE allocation, much smaller than the MMRE of 134% of developers' estimates. A better forecasting accuracy was obtained when the number of historical data points was 20 or higher. These results suggest that Monte Carlo simulations may be used in practice for delivery date and effort forecasting in agile projects, after a few initial sprints.",

        "abstract": "Although testing effort estimation is a very important task in software project management, it is rarely described in the literature. There are many difficulties in finding any useful methods or tools for this purpose. Solutions to many other problems related to testing effort calculation are published much more often. There is also no research focusing on both testing effort estimation and all related areas of software engineering. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review on both questions. Although our primary objective was to find some tools or implementable metods for test effort estimation, we have quickly discovered many other interesting topics related to the main one. The main contribution of this work is the presentation of the testing effort estimation task in a very wide context, indicating the relations with other research fields. This systematic literature review presents a detailed overview of testing effort estimation task, including challenges and approaches to automating it and the solutions proposed in the literature. It also exhaustively investigates related research topics, classifying publications that can be found in connection to the testing effort according to seven criteria formulated on the basis of our research questions. We present here both synthesis of our finding and the deep analysis of the stated research problems.",

Underwater Sensor Network applications based on acoustic, optical and RF communication are gaining popularity, especially acoustic communication in this area for applications such as offshore oil and gas extraction, military surveillance, mine detection, tsunami, and hurricane forecasts to name a few. One of the simpler architectural implementations of the sensor network is the 2D – Underwater Sensor Network, where a group of sensor networks are anchored underwater to the surface, with a cluster head nominated for communication within the cluster nodes and the surface buoyant nodes. There exist certain optimization algorithms that address the problem of optimal cluster head selection to minimize resources consumed and increase the lifespan of the cluster. One such technique that we use in our research is Social Group Optimization (SGO). It is based on the human behavior of learning and solving complex problems. This report uses this SGO technique to choose the cluster head among a set of clusters, in which number of solutions are taken and calculated to yield a robust solution where the sacrifices of time and complexity are minimized.",

This NP-hard problem is complex enough for an algorithm to plan a realistic path for a velocity-bound point robot in a dynamic environment. This paper presents a new CG-Space based real-time dynamic path planning method for finding the obstacle-free path for 10 DOF rocker-bogie type wheeled mobile robot (Rover) traversing over a 3D uneven terrain with dynamic and static obstacles. CG-Space is the locus of the center of gravity location of Rover while moving on a 3D terrain. A swarm intelligence-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method has been modified to plan an optimum collision-free path over CG-Space of Rover with dynamic obstacles. Dynamic replanning using a modified penalty in the PSO objective function can handle the randomly moving obstacles of varying sizes and shapes in real-time. Simulations demonstrate that the Rover can obtain the target location in 3D uneven dynamic environments with fixed and randomly moving obstacles. This 3D dynamic replanning study will benefit the cooperative sensing in multiple Rover systems and target tracking in cluttered environments.",

        "abstract": "Crop diseases are a major threat to food security and economic development, but their rapid identification remains difficult. Strawberry is one of the cash crops grown in Kenya and has a substantial contribution to the country's income with 50% of the foreign earnings from the horticultural crops being attributed to this crop. However, strawberry farming in Kenya has been adversely affected by the prevalence of strawberry fungal leaf diseases mainly leaf Blight and leaf Scorch which occur and affect the strawberry leaves simultaneously. A review of existing computer vision models that have been leveraged for the detection of these diseases discovered that none of the models has the capability to detect leaf Blight and leaf Scorch diseases especially when they occur simultaneously on the same leaf. This makes their detection a challenge. In this paper, we present a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting the simultaneous occurrence of Strawberry Leaf Spot and Leaf Blight. The model presents a novel technique of detecting more than a single class of the strawberry fungal diseases on the same leaf. A dataset containing a total of 1,134 images was used in training and evaluating the model. The model achieved an accuracy of 98%, precision of 98.9%, a recall of 93.3% and an f1-score of 95.9% overall thus demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. The performance of the CNN model was also compared with that of other machine learning algorithms which include Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and the Random Forest. The comparison also included the other existing CNN architectures which are GoogleNet, Resnet and VGG.",

Most prominently, applications that share state across different nodes want their writes to quickly become visible to others, without giving up recoverability guarantees in case a failure occurs. Current solutions of a fast cache backed by storage cannot support this use case easily. In this work, we design a distributed protocol, called Distributed Prefix Recovery (DPR) that builds on top of a sharded cache-store architecture with single-key operations, to provide cross-shard recoverability guarantees. With DPR, many clients can read and update shared state at sub-millisecond latency, while receiving periodic prefix durability guarantees. On failure, DPR quickly restores the system to a prefix-consistent state with a novel non-blocking rollback scheme. We added DPR to a key-value store (FASTER) and cache (Redis) and show that we can get high throughput and low latency similar to in-memory systems, while lazily providing durability guarantees similar to persistent stores.",

        "abstract": "One of the major and recurring issues we confront in today's urbanized world is traffic congestion, which is caused by an increase in the use of private automobiles, and whereas vehicle volume density fluctuates on temporally short and geographically small scales, efficient traffic signal control aids in avoiding traffic bottlenecks. Where this huge problem has piqued the interest of the research and development community, resulting in the creation of a number of Intelligent Traffic Management systems (ITS) where a traffic management technique in which traffic signal timing adjusts, or adapts, based on real traffic demand is known as an adaptive traffic control system (ATCS). Systems for regulating cycle time in real-time may now be produced thanks to embedded system development with growing standards of computing technology, compact electronics boards, software packages, and closed-loop control systems. Most of Libya's traffic control systems are currently devoid of intelligence and operate as an open-loop control system with no feedback or sensing. As a result, there is a need to simulate and improve traffic management systems. The goal of this paper is to improve the traffic control system in to offer intelligent feedback to the current network's congestion state as it adapts to changing traffic density patterns. The method outlined in this paper uses algorithm-based Python code, Driving Scenarios Designer, Video Reader (MATLAB®), and Google Map crowdsource data to control and detect real-time traffic congestion at traffic lights, without the cost of sensor equipment. This algorithm is used to categorize the status of congestion for a particular intersection, by triggering and delivering data to the timer control system, this technique manipulates and optimizes signal timing. By detecting traffic density and dynamically changing the waiting duration of traffic signals, this suggested system is anticipated to eliminate or decrease these needless traffic bottlenecks. Furthermore, the ease with which this technology might be applied to existing traffic signal systems was emphasized.",

The present survey discusses some of the main formal approaches and compares them to informal methods.The analysis uses a set of nine complementary criteria, such as level of abstraction, tool availability, and traceability support. It classifies the approaches into five categories based on their principal style for specifying requirements: natural-language, semi-formal, automata/graphs, mathematical, and seamless (programming-language-based). It includes examples from all of these categories, altogether 21 different approaches, including for example SysML, Relax, Eiffel, Event-B, and Alloy.The review discusses a number of open questions, including seamlessness, the role of tools and education, and how to make industrial applications benefit more from the contributions of formal approaches.",

In its basic form HS codes come in 6 digit format, subdivided hierarchically into groups of two digits (chapters, headings and subheadings). When shipping products, it is mandatory to specify a HS code for the purpose of producing a custom declaration. Currently the process is mostly carried out by human experts who take a decision on the HS code to be assigned to a shipment depending on the item description provided by the shipper. As such the process is time consuming and prone to errors due to generic, incomplete or non-interpretable descriptions. The objective of this research is to automate the classification of HS codes in order to increase productivity to cope with extra volume in the custom classification area. For the purpose of testing the developed models, we used an anonymized data set of shipments provided by DHL. The main contribution of this paper is we applied a deep learning model which have not been tried on tackling the HS code classification problem: an attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) model with integration of hierarchical loss. The model can classify around 29% percentage of the dataset where the model's accuracy can reach 85%.",

As the application complexity and user-bases grow, designing for performance becomes a first-class engineering concern. As an answer to these needs, heterogeneous computing platforms gained widespread attention as powerful tools to continue meeting SLAs for compute-intensive cloud-native workloads. We propose BlastFunction, an FPGA-as-a-Service full-stack framework to ease FPGAs’ adoption for cloud-native workloads, integrating with the vast spectrum of fundamental cloud models. At the IaaS level, BlastFunction time-shares FPGA-based accelerators to provide multi-tenant access to accelerated resources without any code rewriting. At the PaaS level, BlastFunction accelerates functionalities leveraging the serverless model and scales functions proactively, depending on the workload’s performance. Further lowering the FPGAs’ adoption barrier, an accelerators’ registry hosts accelerated functions ready to be used within cloud-native applications, bringing the simplicity of a SaaS-like approach to the developers. After an extensive experimental campaign against state-of-the-art cloud scenarios, we show how BlastFunction leads to higher performance metrics (utilization and throughput) against native execution, with minimal latency and overhead differences. Moreover, the scaling scheme we propose outperforms the main serverless autoscaling algorithms in workload performance and scaling operation amount.",

In online social networks, trust prediction is significant for recommendations of high reputation users as well as in many other applications. In the literature, trust prediction problem can be solved by several strategies, such as matrix factorization, trust propagation, and \\(\\)-NN search. However, most of the existing works have not considered the possible complementarity among these mainstream strategies to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. In this article, we propose a novel trust prediction approach named iSim: an integrated time-aware similarity-based collaborative filtering approach leveraging on user similarity, which integrates three kinds of factors to measure user similarity, including vector space similarity, time-aware matrix factorization, and propagated trust. This article is the first work in the literature employing time-aware matrix factorization and propagated trust in the study of similarity. Additionally, we use several methods like adding inverted index to reduce the time complexity of iSim, and provide its theoretical time bound. Moreover, we also provide the detailed overview and theoretical analysis of the existing works. Finally, the extensive experiments with real-world datasets show that iSim achieves great improvement for both efficiency and effectiveness over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are becoming ubiquitous and are currently used in many security applications: from personal IoT gadgets to banking and databases. Prominent examples of such architectures are Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). A typical TEE relies on a dynamic Root of Trust (RoT) to provide security services such as code/data confidentiality and integrity, isolated secure software execution, remote attestation, and sensor auditing. Despite their usefulness, there is currently no secure means to determine whether a given security service or task is being performed by the particular RoT within a specific physical device. We refer to this as the Root of Trust Identification (RTI) problem and discuss how it inhibits security for applications such as sensing and actuation. We formalize the RTI problem and argue that security of RTI protocols is especially challenging due to local adversaries, cuckoo adversaries, and the combination thereof. To cope with this problem we propose a simple and effective protocol based on biometrics. Unlike biometric-based user authentication, our approach is not concerned with verifying user identity, and requires neither pre-enrollment nor persistent storage for biometric templates. Instead, it takes advantage of the difficulty of cloning a biometric in realtime to securely identify the RoT of a given physical device, by using the biometric as a challenge. Security of the proposed protocol is analyzed in the combined Local and Cuckoo adversarial model. Also, a prototype implementation is used to demonstrate the protocol's feasibility and practicality. We further propose a Proxy RTI protocol, wherein a previously identified RoT assists a remote verifier in identifying new RoTs.",

These IoT-based systems contribute to both daily life and business, including sensitive and emergency situations. In general, the devices or sensors used in the IoT have very limited computational power, storage capacity, and communication capabilities, but they help to collect a large amount of data as well as maintain communication with the other devices in the network. Since most of the IoT devices have no physical security, and often are open to everyone via radio communication and via the internet, they are highly vulnerable to existing and emerging novel security attacks. Further, the IoT devices are usually integrated with the corporate networks; in this case, the impact of attacks will be much more significant than operating in isolation. Due to the constraints of the IoT devices, and the nature of their operation, existing security mechanisms are less effective for countering the attacks that are specific to the IoT-based systems. This article presents a new insider attack, named loophole attack, that exploits the vulnerabilities present in a widely used IPv6 routing protocol in IoT-based systems, called RPL (Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks). To protect the IoT system from this insider attack, a machine learning based security mechanism is presented. The proposed attack has been implemented using a Contiki IoT operating system that runs on the Cooja simulator, and the impacts of the attack are analyzed. Evaluation on the collected network traffic data demonstrates that the machine learning based approaches, along with the proposed features, help to accurately detect the insider attack from the network traffic data.",

        "abstract": "In a world where increasingly complex integrated circuits are manufactured in supply chains across the globe, hardware Trojans are an omnipresent threat. State-of-the-art methods for Trojan detection often require a golden model of the device under test. Other methods that operate on the netlist without a golden model cannot handle complex designs and operate on Trojan-specific sets of netlist graph features. In this work, we propose a novel machine-learning-based method for hardware Trojan detection. Our method first uses a library of known malicious and benign modules in hierarchical designs to train an eXtreme Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier (XGBClassifier). For training, we generate netlist graphs of each hierarchical module and calculate feature vectors comprising structural characteristics of these graphs. After the training phase, we can analyze the synthesized hierarchical modules of an unknown design under test. The method calculates a feature vector for each module. With this feature vector, each module can be classified into either benign or malicious by the previously trained XGBClassifier. After classifying all modules, we derive a classification for all standard cells in the design under test. This technique allows the identification of hardware Trojan cells in a design and highlights regions of interest to direct further reverse engineering efforts. Experiments show that this approach performs with >97% Sensitivity and Specificity across available and newly generated hardware Trojan benchmarks and can be applied to more complex designs than previous netlist-based methods while maintaining similar computational complexity.",

In MANET, every node has a freedom to cooperate in data packet forwarding. MANET is susceptible to various kinds of routing attacks because of its dynamicity, mobility, open medium, and lack of central administration. Thus, security in MANET routing protocol is a vital issue and needs a mechanism to protect communication between nodes. In MANET, a protrusive attack which reduces the network performance is Sybil attack which theft the identities of genuine nodes and impersonate them and drops the packets. In this Paper, Sybil attack detection and prevention (SDP) mechanism is proposed which works as an intrusion detection and prevention system to detect and prevent the MANET against Sybil attack. The proposed SDP mechanism used historical profile analysis and blocking based mechanism that check the real-time as well as previous history of nodes to watch the behavior of Sybil node. Two scenarios of SDP mechanism have been implemented in NS-2 and evaluated with packet delivery ratio, normal routing load, delay and throughput. Accuracy of detection is checked with confusion matrix analysis and found that proposed system gives 90.7% and 97.85% true positive ratio in SDP-I and SDP-II scenarios respectively.",

In residential, rehabilitation, and clinical settings, sensor nodes can be attached to the body of a patient for long-term and uninterrupted monitoring of vital biomedical signals. Likewise, in industrial settings, workers as well as mobile robots can carry sensor nodes to augment their perception and to seamlessly interact with their environments. Nevertheless, such applications require reliable communications as well as high throughput. Considering the primary design goals of the sensing platforms (low-power, affordable cost, large-scale deployment, longevity, operating in the ISM band), maintaining reliable links is a formidable challenge. This challenge can partially be alleviated if the nature of link quality fluctuation can be known or estimated on time. Indeed, higher-level protocols such as handover and routing protocols rely on knowledge of link quality fluctuation to seamlessly transfer communication to alternative routes when the quality of existing routes deteriorates. In this article, we present the result of extensive experimental study to characterise link quality fluctuation in mobile environments. The study focuses on slow movements (<5 km h-1) signifying the movement of people and robots and transceivers complying to the IEEE 802.15.4 specification. Hence, we deployed mobile robots that interact with strategically placed stationary relay nodes. Our study considered different types of link quality characterisation metrics that provide complementary and useful insights. To demonstrate the usefulness of our experiments and observations, we implemented a link quality estimation technique using a Kalman Filter. To set up the model, we employed two link quality metrics along with the statistics we established during our experiments.

Generally speaking, reverse engineering aims to retrieve information from a product, i.e., integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs) in hardware security-related scenarios, in the hope of understanding the functionality of the device and determining its constituent components. Hence, it can raise serious issues concerning Intellectual Property (IP) infringement, the (in)effectiveness of security-related measures, and even new opportunities for injecting hardware Trojans. Ironically, reverse engineering can enable IP owners to verify and validate the design. Nevertheless, this cannot be achieved without overcoming numerous obstacles that limit successful outcomes of the reverse engineering process. This article surveys these challenges from two complementary perspectives: image processing and machine learning. These two fields of study form a firm basis for the enhancement of efficiency and accuracy of reverse engineering processes for both PCBs and ICs. In summary, therefore, this article presents a roadmap indicating clearly the actions to be taken to fulfill hardware trust and assurance objectives.",

        "abstract": "Vehicles have become connected in many ways. They communicate with the cloud and will use Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to exchange warning messages and perform cooperative actions such as platooning. Vehicles have already been attacked and will become even more attractive targets due to their increasing connectivity, the amount of data they produce and their importance to our society. It is therefore crucial to provide cyber security measures to prevent and limit the impact of attacks.  As it is problematic for a vehicle to reliably assess its own state when it is compromised, we investigate how vehicle trust can be used to identify compromised vehicles and how fleet-wide attacks can be detected at an early stage using cloud data. In our proposed V2C Anomaly Detection framework, peer vehicles assess each other based on their perceived behavior in traffic and V2X-enabled interactions, and upload these assessments to the cloud for analysis. This framework consists of four modules. For each module we define functional demands, interfaces and evaluate solutions proposed in literature allowing manufacturers and fleet owners to choose appropriate techniques. We detail attack scenarios where this type of framework is particularly useful in detecting and identifying potential attacks and failing software and hardware. Furthermore, we describe what basic vehicle data the cloud analysis can be based upon.",

Due to resource-constraint of WoT, the traditional security methods cannot be deployed. One of the most appropriate protection mechanisms to resist internal attacks is the trust management system. For the sake of evaluate the performance of WoT reasonably and appropriately, we improve the Beta-based reputation system, and propose a Poisson Distribution-based trust model (PDTM) in this paper. In view of evaluating a sensor node (or terminal) behaviors, its reputation and trust are represented by the Poisson distribution.

Changes in activities of pedestrians, dynamic background, moving camera, view angle and processing time made it more challenging. Recent approaches were justified and compared based on precision accuracy, processing time and minimum resource allocation. The results were also compared by a series of state-of-the-art research datasets with provided significant observations in terms of greater accuracy which can lead to the construction of an extremely improvised system that would save pedestrian people from road accidents and assist autonomous driving systems.

        "abstract": "Although machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely used in forecasting the trend of stock market indices, they failed to consider the following crucial aspects for market forecasting: (1) that investors’ emotions and attitudes toward future market trends have material impacts on market trend forecasting (2) the length of past market data should be dynamically adjusted according to the market status and (3) the transition of market statutes should be considered when forecasting market trends. In this study, we proposed an innovative ML method to forecast China's stock market trends by addressing the three issues above. Specifically, sentimental factors (see Appendix [1] for full trans) were first collected to measure investors’ emotions and attitudes. Then, a non-stationary Markov chain (NMC) model was used to capture dynamic transitions of market statutes. We choose the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, namely, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), to predict the state of the market at time t, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model was used to estimate the varying length of past market data in market trend prediction, where the input of LSTM (the state of the market at time t) was the output of BERT and probabilities for opening and closing of the gates in the LSTM model were based on outputs of the NMC model. Finally, the optimum parameters of the proposed algorithm were calculated using a reinforced learning-based deep Q-Network. Compared to existing forecasting methods, the proposed algorithm achieves better results with a forecasting accuracy of 61.77%, annualized return of 29.25%, and maximum losses of −8.29%. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved the lowest forecasting error: mean square error (0.095), root mean square error (0.0739), mean absolute error (0.104), and mean absolute percent error (15.1%). As a result, the proposed market forecasting model can help investors obtain more accurate market forecast information.",

We define continuous evaluation as multiple evaluations of the software architecture that begins at the early stages of the development and is periodically and repeatedly performed throughout the lifetime of the software system. Numerous approaches have been developed for continuous evaluation; to handle dynamics and uncertainties at run-time, over the past years, these approaches are still very few, limited, and lack maturity. Objective: This review surveys efforts on architecture evaluation and provides a unified terminology and perspective on the subject. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify and analyse architecture evaluation approaches for uncertainty including continuous and non-continuous, covering work published between 1990–2020. We examined each approach and provided a classification framework for this field. We present an analysis of the results and provide insights regarding open challenges. Major results and conclusions: The survey reveals that most of the existing architecture evaluation approaches typically lack an explicit linkage between design-time and run-time. Additionally, there is a general lack of systematic approaches on how continuous architecture evaluation can be realised or conducted. To remedy this lack, we present a set of necessary requirements for continuous evaluation and describe some examples.",

In addition to evaluating detection methods, we assess the impact of the domain generation ecosystem on prior results about the nature of blocklists and how they are maintained. The results of the evaluation of open source detection methods finds all methods are inadequate for practical use. The results of the blocklist impact study finds that generated domains decrease the overlap among blocklists; however, while the effect is large in relative terms, the baseline is so small that the core conclusions of the prior work are sustained. Namely, that blocklist construction is very targeted, context-specific, and as a result blocklists do no overlap much. We recommend that Domain Generation Algorithm detection should also be similarly narrowly targeted to specific algorithms and specific malware families, rather than attempting to create general-purpose detection for machine-generated domains.",

        "abstract": "Class imbalance problem is prevalent in many real-world domains. It has become an active area of research. In binary classification problems, imbalance learning refers to learning from a dataset with a high degree of skewness to the negative class. This phenomenon causes classification algorithms to perform woefully when predicting positive classes with new examples. Data resampling, which involves manipulating the training data before applying standard classification techniques, is among the most commonly used techniques to deal with the class imbalance problem. This article presents a new hybrid sampling technique that improves the overall performance of classification algorithms for solving the class imbalance problem significantly. The proposed method called the Hybrid Cluster-Based Undersampling Technique (HCBST) uses a combination of the cluster undersampling technique to under-sample the majority instances and an oversampling technique derived from Sigma Nearest Oversampling based on Convex Combination, to oversample the minority instances to solve the class imbalance problem with a high degree of accuracy and reliability. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested using 11 datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Metric Data Program data repository and University of California Irvine Machine Learning data repository with varying degrees of imbalance. Results were compared with classification algorithms such as the K-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, decision tree, random forest, neural network, AdaBoost, naïve Bayes, and quadratic discriminant analysis. Tests results revealed that for the same datasets, the HCBST performed better with average performances of 0.73, 0.67, and 0.35 in terms of performance measures of area under curve, geometric mean, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient, respectively, across all the classifiers used for this study. The HCBST has the potential of improving the performance of the class imbalance problem, which by extension, will improve on the various applications that rely on the concept for a solution.",

Although prior empirical research examined the experience of working-from-home within small-scale groups and for targeted kinds of work, the pandemic provides HCI and CSCW researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to understand the psycho-social impacts of a universally mandated work-from-home experience rather than an autonomously chosen one. Drawing on boundary theory and a methodological approach grounded in humanistic geography, we conducted a qualitative analysis of Reddit data drawn from two work-from-home-related subreddits between March 2020 and January 2021. In this paper, we present a characterization of the challenges and solutions discussed within these online communities for adapting work to a hybrid or fully remote modality, managing reconfigured work-life boundaries, and reconstructing the home's sense of place to serve multiple, sometimes conflicting roles. We discuss how these findings suggest an emergent interplay among adapted work practice, reimagined physical (and virtual) spaces, and the establishment and continual re-negotiation of boundaries as a means for anticipating the long-term impact of COVID on future conceptualizations of productivity and work.",

An algorithm of solving the multi-objective optimization problem based on projection plane is proposed in this paper, which divides the objective space into projection plane and free dimension(s) according to the decision demand, carves the projection plane into several projection grids, and solves the optimal value of the free dimension(s) on each projection grid, so as to obtain the optimal solutions of the multi-objective optimization problem. The division of projection plane reduces the problem of high-dimensional multi-objective optimization to that of low-dimensional multi-objective optimization, which only solves the optimization of free dimension objects on the projection plane; The carving of projection grids determines the solutions in the specific range of the specified object values, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of the solutions.

A COVID-19 confirmed patient is experiencing symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Based on the results of laboratory tests and/or chest X-rays, the COVID-19 diagnosis is established. When it comes to research using chest CT scans /X-ray for the diagnosis of COVID-19, which is based on medical imaging, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are increasingly being applied in a variety of ways. Machine learning and deep learning are fields of artificial intelligence that can be used to analyze the data that was acquired in order to better understand the origins of COVID-19. The outcomes of applying such an approach will aid in a better understanding of the nature of the threat and how it might be mitigated. For this reason, this work gives an overview of deep learning and machine learning approaches for the detection of COVID-19.

Therefore, we argue that to make databases more flexible as platforms and to extend their functionality to new data types and operations requires exposing a lower level of abstraction: instead of working with SQL it would be desirable for database engines to compile, optimize, and run a collection of sub-operators for manipulating and managing data, offering them as an external interface. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of this, provide an initial list of such sub-operators, and show how they can be used in practice.",

While recent studies on log knowledge extraction focus on lifting entities from log messages for enriching a background knowledge graph (BKG), they do not involve knowledge reasoning for inferring implicit relations nor guarantee that the knowledge learned from log streams is consistent with the background knowledge. In this preliminary research paper, we present a log extraction approach to log knowledge graph (KG) construction. It includes a novel strategy that utilizes inference rules from a background knowledge graph to learn new triples and validate triples. Also, it implements a local to global strategy to perform reasoning on temporary log instance graphs (LIGs) then on the extended BKG, which significantly reduces query space. Finally we demonstrate the applicability of this approach by a use case in the context of root cause analysis.",

Pirated applications on Android app stores are harming developers and their users by clone scammers. The scammers usually generate pirated versions of the same applications and publish them in different open-source app stores. There is no centralized system between these app stores to prevent scammers from publishing pirated applications. As most of the app stores are hosted on cloud storage, therefore a cloud-based interaction system can prevent scammers from publishing pirated applications. In this paper, we proposed IoT-based cloud architecture for clone detection using program dependency analysis. First, the newly submitted APK and possible original files are selected from app stores. The APK Extractor and JDEX decompiler extract APK and DEX files for Java source code analysis. The dependency graphs of Java files are generated to extract a set of weighted features. The Stacked-Long Short-Term Memory (S-LSTM) deep learning model is designed to predict possible clones.Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach can achieve an average accuracy of 95.48% among clones from different application stores.",

        "abstract": "Compatibility and wide availability of WLAN make its integration with 3GPP-based networks (LTE, 5G), the most cost efficient solution to meet high service demands and ubiquitous radio coverage. In a heterogeneous network, seamless mobility, provisioning of quality of service (QoS) and proper distribution of load among interworking networks are the most challenging issues and need to be resolved accurately. In the literature, many theoretical algorithms (prediction based algorithms) and mathematical solutions (utility or cost function) have been proposed for load sharing in the heterogeneous networks. However, these algorithms are either based on assumptions like availability of certain parameters of neighbouring networks or possibility of exchanging the network conditions in real time. Such assumptions restrict the implementation of these solutions on real network infrastructures due to non-availability of protocols or interfaces to exchange the network parameters. Moreover, sustainability of the specified QoS for each traffic type is very important while assisting a 3GPP network with a non-3GPP network. This paper presents a QoS class identifier (QCI) aware load sharing technique based on the available information at the deciding entity of the anchor network. A network architecture is designed to efficiently provide radio coverage inside a building with single LTE small cell and an optimum number of WLAN APs (Access Points). The idea is to not only increase the overall network capacity but improve the user experience as well. Simulation results show that the proposed load sharing technique for the LTE-WLAN integrated network not only extends the mobile network services to the confined coverage of indoor environment but also maintains the QoS for high priority traffic.",

        "abstract": "Verifying imperative programs is hard. A key difficulty is that the specification of what an imperative program does is often intertwined with details about pointers and imperative state. Although there are a number of powerful separation logics that allow the details of imperative state to be captured and managed, these details are complicated and reasoning about them requires significant time and expertise. In this paper, we take a different approach: a memory-safe type system that, as part of type-checking, extracts functional specifications from imperative programs. This disentangles imperative state, which is handled by the type system, from functional specifications, which can be verified without reference to pointers. A key difficulty is that sometimes memory safety depends crucially on the functional specification of a program; e.g., an array index is only memory-safe if the index is in bounds. To handle this case, our specification extraction inserts dynamic checks into the specification. Verification then requires the additional proof that none of these checks fail. However, these checks are in a purely functional language, and so this proof also requires no reasoning about pointers.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on the comprehensive investigation of stop-and-go waves appearing in closed-circuit ring road traffic wherein we evaluate various longitudinal dynamical models for vehicles. It is known that the behavior of human-driven vehicles, with other traffic elements such as density held constant, could stimulate stop-and-go waves, which do not dissipate on the circuit ring road. Stop-and-go waves can be dissipated by adding automated vehicles (AVs) to the ring. Thorough investigations of the performance of AV longitudinal control algorithms were carried out in Flow, which is an integrated platform for reinforcement learning on traffic control. Ten AV algorithms presented in the literature are evaluated. For each AV algorithm, experiments are carried out by varying distributions and penetration rates of AVs. Two different distributions of AVs are studied. For the first distribution scenario, AVs are placed consecutively. Penetration rates are varied from 1 AV (5%) to all AVs (100%). For the second distribution scenario, AVs are placed with even distribution of human-driven vehicles in between any two AVs. In this scenario, penetration rates are varied from 2 AVs (10%) to 11 AVs (50%). Multiple runs (10 runs) are simulated to average out the randomness in the results. From more than 3,000 simulation experiments, we investigated how AV algorithms perform differently with varying distributions and penetration rates while all AV algorithms remained fixed under all distributions and penetration rates. Time to stabilize, maximum headway, vehicle miles traveled, and fuel economy are used to evaluate their performance. Using these metrics, we find that the traffic condition improvement is not necessarily dependent on the distribution for most of the AV controllers, particularly when no cooperation among AVs is considered. Traffic condition is generally improved with a higher AV penetration rate with only one of the AV algorithms showing a contrary trend. Among all AV algorithms in this study, the reinforcement learning controller shows the most consistent improvement under all distributions and penetration rates.",

According to the students’ SK, their CL methods have been classified into six types of thinking modes, which has three different corresponding understanding levels for each mode. The appropriate recommended materials to the students who are interested in the information provided, such as, text-based teaching materials, computer assisted materials, simulation tools and game activities, can increases the motivations of the students to learn, considered their different characteristics and understanding. The performance of this RS has been tracked over a period of 16 years, which can effectively improve the personalized teaching quality in the area of computer science, since it may be useful in heightening students’ motivation and interest in CL in science.

We posit that while familiarity helps drive short term engagement, jointly optimizing for discovery enables the platform to influence and shape consumption across suppliers. We propose a multi-level ordered-weighted averaging based objective balancer to help maintain a healthy balance with respect to familiarity and discovery objectives, and conduct a series of offline evaluations and online AB tests, to demonstrate that despite the presence of strict trade-offs, we can achieve wins on both satisfaction and discover centric objectives.

        "abstract": "Tennis is a unique and beautiful sport. In recent years, tennis has become more and more enthusiastic around the world, and some tennis academies have sprung up like bamboo shoots. With the gradual improvement of the tennis atmosphere, the tennis crowd has gradually increased, but at this time there is a lack of a comprehensive tennis training base and a scientific and systematic talent training model to promote the development of Chinese tennis in the future. And it happens to be a period of rapid development of artificial intelligence. Therefore, this article studies and discusses the training path of tennis talents in colleges and universities based on artificial intelligence. Through an in-depth analysis of the training path of our country's tennis competitive talents, the current stage of our country's tennis talent training mainly relies on the following three methods: sports team training model; club training model; government, enterprise, and family joint training model. Through the introduction of artificial intelligence-related technologies, experiments on these three methods are conducted in the artificial intelligence environment. The results show that, compared with ordinary tennis talent training models, the physical and humanistic qualities of college tennis talents get 30%. The improvement of the service period and technical level of college tennis competitive talents has also reached 10% compared with the traditional training path. This shows that in the current global environment, combining the training path of tennis competitive talents in colleges and universities with the emerging artificial intelligence technology, the effect is very significant, and it is the development trend of future tennis competitive talent training.",

In this paper, the specific purpose is to optimise CoRoNNa for analysing the impact of different mobility containment policies on the epidemic. To this end, we integrate cumulative viral diffusion statistics and local demographic and mobility information of several countries. Our analysis confirms that mobility data have a strong, but delayed, effect on the viral spread. In this context, CoRoNNa has superior performances when compared with other frameworks that incorporate multivariate lagged predictors, and with simple LSTM models. On the contrary, no method is able to predict daily cases based only on lagged viral diffusion statistics.",

Discrete-event-simulation-based resource-constrained scheduling analysis is instrumental in analyzing semi-productive work hours resulting from labor transferring between activities and crew matching. In the case study, semi-productive work hours can be lowered from about one half of the total working time to a third by fine-tuning the crew size and work sequencing based on the simulation model, thereby resulting in enhancements on the time and cost performances of the entire project.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence provide methods and algorithms to take advantage of sensor and actuator data in automated production systems. Product quality monitoring is one of the promising applications available for data-driven modeling, particularly in cases where the quality parameters cannot be measured with reasonable effort. This is the case for defects such as cracks in workpieces of hydraulic metal powder presses. However, the variety of shapes produced at a powder press requires training of individual models based on a minimal sample size of unlabeled data to adapt to changing settings. Therefore, this article proposes an unsupervised product quality monitoring approach based on dynamic time warping and non-linear regression to detect anomalies in unlabeled sensor and actuator data. A preprocessing step that isolates only the relevant intervals of the process is further introduced, facilitating efficient product quality monitoring. The evaluation on an industrial dataset with 37 samples, generated in test runs, shows a true-positive rate for detected product quality defects of 100% while preserving an acceptable accuracy. Moreover, the approach achieves the output within less than 10 seconds, assuring that the result is available before the next workpiece is processed. In this way, efficient product quality management is possible, reducing time- and cost-intensive quality inspections.",

This kind of dynamic analysis can be instrumental to reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and debugging. While these analyses are typically well-supported for homogeneous desktop platforms (e.g., x86 desktop PCs), they can rarely be applied in the heterogeneous world of embedded systems. One approach to enable dynamic analyses of embedded systems is to move software stacks from physical systems into virtual environments that sufficiently model hardware behavior. This process which we call \"rehosting\" poses a significant research challenge with major implications for security analyses. Although rehosting has traditionally been an unscientific and ad-hoc endeavor undertaken by domain experts with varying time and resources at their disposal, researchers are beginning to address rehosting challenges systematically and in earnest. In this paper, we establish that emulation is insufficient to conduct large-scale dynamic analysis of real-world hardware systems and present rehosting as a firmware-centric alternative. Furthermore, we taxonomize preliminary rehosting efforts, identify the fundamental components of the rehosting process, and propose directions for future research.",

Moreover, during the COVID-19 lock downs, people's online traffic increased significantly, to the extent that many are still doing their shopping, banking, learning, working, exercise, entertainment and even socialising online. In this increasingly digital existence, the security issue cannot be ignored especially internet security. As more of users daily tasks are performed online, people's mobile phone, laptop, and tablet interfaces have become extensions of themselves and it is crucial that these afford and support a user in remaining secure. To ensure this, the research proposes that the everyday user needs to be able to engage and use the security driven mechanisms on these devices and applications (i.e. warnings and cautions). However, in reality many users often ignore and discard online warning and caution signs. This paper will introduce plans for some future research that will explore aesthetics for the design of a new body of online security warning and cautions. Like in the physical world, the aim is to ensure that people are equipped with effective warning and caution signs to protect them as they go about their day to day online tasks. Making future design suggestions for not just usable and secure but also engaging online warnings, the research proposes to open up an entirely new avenue of study around usable security aesthetics.",

Specifically, the missing data is filled by the result of GMM clustering, and the imputed data is then taken for GMM clustering. These two steps alternatively negotiate with each other to achieve optimum. By this way, the imputed data can best serve for GMM clustering. A two-step alternative algorithm with proved convergence is carefully designed to solve the resultant optimization problem.

We use Facebook's automatic alt text tool as our primary case study. First, we analyze the policies that Facebook has adopted with respect to identity categories, such as race, gender, age, etc., and the company's decisions about whether to present these terms in alt text. We then describe an alternative---and manual---approach practiced in the museum community, focusing on how museums determine what to include in alt text descriptions of cultural artifacts. We compare these policies, using notable points of contrast to develop an analytic framework that characterizes the particular apprehensions behind these policy choices. We conclude by considering two strategies that seem to sidestep some of these concerns, finding that there are no easy ways to avoid the normative dilemmas posed by the use of computer vision to automate alt text.",

This is problematic for IoT devices, which are severely resource-constrained and must remain operational in the field for years.Unfortunately, identification and complete removal of code related to unwanted features requires familiarity with codebases of interest, cumbersome manual effort, and may introduce bugs. We address these difficulties by introducing PRAT, a system that takes as input the codebase of software of interest, identifies and maps features to code, presents this information to a human analyst, and removes all code belonging to unwanted features. PRAT solves the challenge of identifying feature-related code through a novel form of differential dynamic analysis and visualizes results as user-friendly feature graphs.Evaluation on diverse codebases shows superior code removal compared to both manual feature deactivation and state-of-art debloating tools, and generality across programming languages. Furthermore, a user study comparing PRAT to manual code analysis shows that it can significantly simplify the feature identification workflow.",

Recent PUM architectures extend upon these Boolean primitives to perform bit-serial computation using memory. Unfortunately, several practical limitations of the underlying memory devices restrict how large emerging memory arrays can be, which hinders the ability of conventional bit-serial computation approaches to deliver high performance in addition to large energy savings.  In this paper, we propose RACER, a cost-effective PUM architecture that delivers high performance and large energy savings using small arrays of resistive memories. RACER makes use of a bit-pipelining execution model, which can pipeline bit-serial w-bit computation across w small tiles. We fully design efficient control and peripheral circuitry, whose area can be amortized over small memory tiles without sacrificing memory density, and we propose an ISA abstraction for RACER to allow for easy program/compiler integration. We evaluate an implementation of RACER using NOR-capable ReRAM cells across a range of microbenchmarks extracted from data-intensive applications, and find that RACER provides 107 ×, 12 ×, and 7 × the performance of a 16-core CPU, a 2304-shader-core GPU, and a state-of-the-art in-SRAM compute substrate, respectively, with energy savings of 189 ×, 17 ×, and 1.3 ×.",

Firstly, for each video data set, video frames are cut at a certain FPS and saved as training set and test set, and the classification performance of images is regarded as the classification performance of corresponding videos. Then, feature extraction and model fusion are used to extract dynamic gestures of characters, so as to extract key actions and training classification models. After the training, load the model to check and verify all the video frames in the test set, and get the output of top1 accuracy rate and Top5 accuracy rate in the whole test set. Finally, real-time detection is carried out. The experimental analysis of 170 video files shows that the average accuracy of the improved method is significantly higher than that of other common neural networks. The average detection accuracy in various gestures such as click and zoom was 93%.",

        "abstract": "Despite the substantial progress in compiler testing, research endeavors have mainly focused on detecting compiler crashes and subtle miscompilations caused by bugs in the implementation of compiler optimizations. Surprisingly, this growing body of work neglects other compiler components, most notably the front-end. In statically-typed programming languages with rich and expressive type systems and modern features, such as type inference or a mix of object-oriented with functional programming features, the process of static typing in compiler front-ends is complicated by a high-density of bugs. Such bugs can lead to the acceptance of incorrect programs (breaking code portability or the type system's soundness), the rejection of correct (e.g. well-typed) programs, and the reporting of misleading errors and warnings.  We conduct, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study for understanding and characterizing typing-related compiler bugs. To do so, we manually study 320 typing-related bugs (along with their fixes and test cases) that are randomly sampled from four mainstream JVM languages, namely Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Groovy. We evaluate each bug in terms of several aspects, including their symptom, root cause, bug fix's size, and the characteristics of the bug-revealing test cases. Some representative observations indicate that: (1) more than half of the typing-related bugs manifest as unexpected compile-time errors: the buggy compiler wrongly rejects semantically correct programs, (2) the majority of typing-related bugs lie in the implementations of the underlying type systems and in other core components related to operations on types, (3) parametric polymorphism is the most pervasive feature in the corresponding test cases, (4) one third of typing-related bugs are triggered by non-compilable programs.  We believe that our study opens up a new research direction by driving future researchers to build appropriate methods and techniques for a more holistic testing of compilers.",

Naturally, the choice of these features play a very important role in the success of this system, and high-level features are required to reduce the “semantic gap.” In this article, we propose to use features derived from pre-trained network models from a deep-learning convolution network trained for a large image classification problem. This approach appears to produce vastly superior results for a variety of databases, and it outperforms many contemporary CBIR systems.

We aim to bridge the gap between data collection and summary generation by mining the data for interesting behavioral findings that may provide hints about a user’s tendencies. Our focus is on improving the explainability of temporal personal health data via a set of informative summary templates, or “protoforms.” These protoforms span both evaluation-based summaries that help users evaluate their health goals and pattern-based summaries that explain their implicit behaviors. In addition to individual-level summaries, the protoforms we use are also designed for population-level summaries. We apply our approach to generate summaries (both univariate and multivariate) from real user health data and show that the summaries our system generates are both interesting and useful.",

Those controllers comprise with numerous fractional integrators and differentiators. The gains of the proposed controllers are optimized using the newly introduced marine predators algorithm (MPA). The analysis of the controllers is conducted in a realistic two area interconnected power system having diverse sources of power generation including communication delay, HVDC link and a geothermal power plant (GTPP) in both areas.

In this paper, we propose IGScript, a novel script-based interaction grammar tool, to help build scientific data presentation animations for communication. We design a dual-space interface and a compiler which converts natural language-like grammar statements or scripts into a data story animation to make an interactive customization on script-driven data presentations, and then develop a code generator (decompiler) to translate the interactive data exploration animations back into script codes to achieve statement parameters. IGScript makes the presentation animations editable, e.g., it allows to cut, copy, paste, append, or even delete some animation clips. We demonstrate the usability, customizability, and flexibility of IGScript by a user study, four case studies conducted by using four types of commonly-used scientific data, and performance evaluations.",

In this paper, we empirically demystify the causes and fixes of \"bad\" error messages, by qualitatively studying 201 Stack Overflow threads and 335 GitHub issues. We specifically focus on error messages encountered in data science development, which is an increasingly important but not well studied domain. We found that the causes of \"bad\" error messages are far more complicated than poor phrasing or flawed articulation of error message content. Many error messages are inherently and inevitably misleading or uninformative, since libraries do not know user intentions and cannot \"see\" external errors. Fixes to error-message-related issues mostly involve source code changes, while exclusive message content updates only take up a small portion. In addition, whether an error message is informative or helpful is not always clear-cut; even error messages that clearly pinpoint faults and resolutions can still cause confusion for certain users. These findings thus call for a more in-depth investigation on how error messages should be evaluated and improved in the future.",

We formulate lifelog image retrieval as a series of mapping processes where a semantic gap exists for relating basic semantic attributes with high-level query topics. The SRM serves both as a formalism to construct a trainable model to bridge the semantic gap and an algorithm to implement the training process on real-world lifelog data. Based on the SRM, we propose a computational framework of lifelog analytics to support various applications of lifelog information access, such as image retrieval, summarization, and insight visualization. Systematic evaluations are performed on three challenging benchmarking tasks to show the effectiveness of our method.",

This requires the consideration of a number of measures to ensure reliable results. In this study, the robustness of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and some state-of-arts classifiers were investigated on six (6) different (complete and incomplete) medical datasets. Multiple imputation technique with 5-fold-iteration was used to address the issue of missing data points in datasets with holes. The technique regenerated the missing values 100% in all the datasets. The performance of ELM was compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) on the complete and imputed datasets. The evaluations were based on classification accuracy, computational time and stability of the algorithms. ELM has 83.33% overall best accuracy, and 100% best computational time of the simulations. However, the stability of ELM is subject to further improvement, which is an area of further research.",

However, computing devices in a Volunteer Computing System (VCS) are highly dynamic and heterogeneous in terms of their processing power, monetary cost, and data transferring latency. To ensure both of the high Quality of Service (QoS) and low cost for different requests, all of the available computing resources must be used efficiently. Task scheduling is an NP-hard problem that is considered as one of the main critical challenges in a heterogeneous VCS. Due to this, in this article, we design two task scheduling algorithms for VCSs, named Min-CCV and Min-V. The main goal of the proposed algorithms is jointly minimizing the computation, communication, and delay violation cost for the Internet of Things (IoT) requests. Our extensive simulation results show that proposed algorithms are able to allocate tasks to volunteer fog/cloud resources more efficiently than the state-of-the-art. Specifically, our algorithms improve the deadline satisfaction task rates around 99.5% and decrease the total cost between 15 to 53% in comparison with the genetic-based algorithm.",

It is challenging to design a versatile and accurate heterogeneous test environment that is agile enough to cover a continuous evolution of the code base and platforms. This mission is even more challenging when organized in an agile open-source community process with many contributors such as for the RIOT OS. Hardware in the Loop (HiL) testing and Continuous Integration (CI) are automatable approaches to verify functionality, prevent regressions, and improve the overall quality at development speed in large community projects.In this paper, we present PHiLIP (Primitive Hardware in the Loop Integration Product), an open-source external reference device together with tools that validate the system software while it controls hardware and interprets physical signals. Instead of focusing on a specific test setting, PHiLIP takes the approach of a tool-assisted agile HiL test process, designed for continuous evolution and deployment cycles. We explain its design, describe how it supports HiL tests, evaluate performance metrics, and report on practical experiences of employing PHiLIP in an automated CI test infrastructure. Our initial deployment comprises 22 unique platforms, each of which executes 98 peripheral tests every night. PHiLIP allows for easy extension of low-cost, adaptive testing infrastructures but serves testing techniques and tools to a much wider range of applications.",

In this paper, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is designed to adaptively set parameters for a GA used for solving a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). An RL agent interacts with the GA environment by taking actions that affect the parameters governing its evolution, starting from a given initial point. The results obtained by this RL-GA procedure are then compared with those obtained by alternate static parameter values. For a set of benchmark problems, the solutions obtained by the RL-GA are better (up to 11% improvement) than those obtained for the set as compared to the alternate approach. Examination of the results shows that the RL-GA maintains great diversity in the population pool, especially as the iterations accrue. Computational runs are traced to show how the RL agent learns from population diversity and solution improvements over time, leading to near-optimal solutions.",

It is our position that since modelling of virtual characters has become an integral part of the scientific practice in our field, we must develop a common taxonomy to discuss these models. With this goal in mind, we conduct an in-depth analysis of a selection of projects, categorizing existing agent social interactions, and comparing results from research-based and commercial social simulation works in the entertainment domain. We conceptualize a taxonomy that classifies agent interactions by their social behaviours, inter-agent communication, knowledge flow, and the change in their relationships. We posit such a taxonomy would allow scientists to reproduce and evaluate existing models, collaborate on standards, share advances with other researchers and practitioners, allow for better communication and methodologies developed for new techniques, and allow for a more rigorous model-to-model analysis.",

Detection rules are inferred offline and can be periodically automatically updated online for intrusion detection. In this context, we implement in the present paper various attacks against MQTT in a carefully designed and very realistic experiment environment, instead of a simulation program as commonly seen in previous works, for data generation. Besides, we investigate a Bayesian rule learning based approach as countermeasure, which is able to detect various attack types. A Bayesian network is learned from training data and subsequently translated into a rule set for intrusion detection. The combination of prior knowledge (about the communication protocol and target system) and data help to efficiently learn the Bayesian network. The translation from the Bayesian network to a set of inherently interpretable rules can be regarded as a transformation from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge. We show that our proposed method can achieve not only good detection performance but also high interpretability.",

        "abstract": "In Medicine Deep Learning has become an essential tool to achieve outstanding diagnosis on image data. However, one critical problem is that Deep Learning comes with complicated, black-box models so it is not possible to analyze their trust level directly. So, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to build additional interfaces for explaining how the model has reached the outputs by moving from the input data. Of course, that's again another competitive problem to analyze if such methods are successful according to the human view. So, this paper comes with two important research efforts: (1) to build an explainable deep learning model targeting medical image analysis, and (2) to evaluate the trust level of this model via several evaluation works including human contribution. The target problem was selected as the brain tumor classification, which is a remarkable, competitive medical image-based problem for Deep Learning. In the study, MR-based pre-processed brain images were received by the Subtractive Spatial Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (SSLW-CNN) model, which includes additional operators to reduce the complexity of classification. In order to ensure the explainable background, the model also included Class Activation Mapping (CAM). It is important to evaluate the trust level of a successful model. So, numerical success rates of the SSLW-CNN were evaluated based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), computational time, computational overhead, and brain tumor classification accuracy. The objective of the proposed SSLW-CNN model is to obtain faster and good tumor classification with lesser time. The results illustrate that the SSLW-CNN model provides better performance of PSNR which is enhanced by 8%, classification accuracy is improved by 33%, computation time is reduced by 19%, computation overhead is decreased by 23%, and classification time is minimized by 13%, as compared to state-of-the-art works. Because the model provided good numerical results, it was then evaluated in terms of XAI perspective by including doctor-model based evaluations such as feedback CAM visualizations, usability, expert surveys, comparisons of CAM with other XAI methods, and manual diagnosis comparison. The results show that the SSLW-CNN provides good performance on brain tumor diagnosis and ensures a trustworthy solution for the doctors.",

        "abstract": "Binary code similarity detection is to detect the similarity of code at binary (assembly) level without source code. Existing work still has their limitation when dealing with mutated binary code with different compiling options. We proposed a novel approach to address this problem. By inspecting the binary code, we found that generally, within a function, some instructions aim to calculate (prepare) value for some other instructions. The latter instructions are defined by us the key instructions. Currently, we define four categories of key instructions: calling subfunctions, comparing instruction, returning instruction, and memory address writing instruction. Thus if we symbolically execute similar binary codes, the symbolic value at these key instructions should be similar. We implemented our idea into a tool. This prototype tool can: 1. symbolically execute binary code, 2. extract symbolic values at key instructions into a graph, and 3. compare the symbolic graph similarity. In our implementation, we also address some problems, including path explosion and loop handling.",

The conclusions are as follows: (1)The Bayesian algorithm can effectively remove the non meteorological echo combined with the texture features of polarimetric variable; According to the micro raindrop method, ZDR can be easily calibrated online; the quality control of ΦDP is processed by the linear programming mathematical method(LP), which can ensure the cumulative increase of ΦDP and non negativity of KDP in the rainfall area. (2) The evaluation results of CSU-HIDRO(Colorado State University-Hydrometeor Identification Rainfall Optimization) show that the normalized error(NE) is reduced by about 13.90% after the quality control scheme proposed in this paper.

        "abstract": "Graded modal types systems and coeffects are becoming a standard formalism to deal with context-dependent, usage-sensitive computations, especially when combined with computational effects. From a semantic perspective, effectful and coeffectful languages have been studied mostly by means of denotational semantics and almost nothing has been done from the point of view of relational reasoning. This gap in the literature is quite surprising, since many cornerstone results — such as non-interference, metric preservation, and proof irrelevance — on concrete coeffects are inherently relational. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a general theory and calculus of program relations for higher-order languages with combined effects and coeffects. The relational calculus builds upon the novel notion of a corelator (or comonadic lax extension) to handle coeffects relationally. Inside such a calculus, we define three notions of effectful and coeffectful program refinements: contextual approximation, logical preorder, and applicative similarity. These are the first operationally-based notions of program refinement (and, consequently, equivalence) for languages with combined effects and coeffects appearing in the literature. We show that the axiomatics of a corelator (together with the one of a relator) is precisely what is needed to prove all the aforementioned program refinements to be precongruences, this way obtaining compositional relational techniques for reasoning about combined effects and coeffects.",

In this work, both SV and KWS are processed by the proposed BWN with unified training and optimization framework which can be performed for various application scenarios. By the system-architecture co-design, SV and KWS share most of the network parameters, and the classification part is calculated separately according to different targets. An energy-efficient NN accelerator which can be dynamically reconfigured to process different layers of the BWN with splitting calculation of frequency domain convolution is proposed. SV and KWS can be achieved with only one time calculation of each input speech frame, which greatly improves the computing energy efficiency. The computing units of the NN accelerator are optimized using precision-adaptive approximate computing method with Dual-VDD to further reduce the energy cost.

As thrust determination is a two-way coupling problem, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -based approach is often used for obtaining accurate estimates. CFD simulations are computationally intensive operation and cannot be performed online during motion planning. This paper reports a deep learning model for determining thrust acting on a robotic fish wherein the training data is generated by offline CFD simulations. The model takes a list of input variables such as robot geometry, motion parameters, orientation and surrounding conditions and determines the thrust acting on the robot for the given conditions. We also report validation of the thrust determined via the developed model with respect to CFD simulation results and physical experimental data reported in the literature. The developed approach reduces the computation memory utilized in the process and even lowers the computation time by a factor of about 50, with appreciable accuracy in results. We envisage that the developed approach can be used for the computation of motion primitives in model predictive planning framework and thereby can allow online dynamically feasible trajectory planning of fish-inspired robots.",

In addition, the data on different medical platforms cannot be utilized due to inconsistent structures. To address the above two problems, this paper proposes a framework for doctor recommendation using multi-source heterogeneous data with two models: knowledge fusion model and doctor recommendation model. In the knowledge fusion model, two systems are established for co-evolution to integrate multi-source heterogeneity data. One system maps various types of health data to coding strings for evolutionary calculation; the other uses co-evolution to generate a unified coding string. In the doctor recommendation model, the ranking of doctors under different attributes is used as input to obtain the comprehensive ranking of doctors, the method performs effective to fuse knowledge from all kinds of data. The experimental results on 1157 orthopedic surgeons show that our framework greatly improves the computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy.",

To detect the identity fraud attacks caused by an authentication server compromise, we propose two mutual authentication protocols by using a pseudo-random function family and a one-time signature (OTS) scheme. Our idea is to leverage the continuously evolving OTS signing and verifying keys at the signer and the verifier sides respectively for identity fraud detection because an identity fraud attack would violate the victim's honest OTS key update procedure.

This approach is based on hardware primitives and cryptographic modules, and it can be deployed in environments where communication channels might be insecure. The implementation of the framework is flexible, as it can be adapted in regards to the IoT device’s available hardware resources and constraints. Our security analysis shows that our framework is resilient to a variety of attack vectors. The experimental setup demonstrates the feasibility of the approach.

However, due to the increasing scale of the network and the intelligence of devices, the development of the service-oriented IoT has also been accompanied by the issue of trust which is crucial to the security and stability of the system. Blockchain, as an emerging distributed ledger technology, is considered to be a driving force to improve the trust management of the service-oriented IoT. This research is a systematic analysis with the goal of illustrating and analyzing how the blockchain contributes to addressing the issue of trust management in service-oriented IoT. The objective of this paper is to understand the trust issue in the service-oriented IoT and analyze the potential blockchain-based solution, thereby motivating further research interest in this field.",

        "abstract": "In the multiple workflow scheduling problem a set of workflows has to be scheduled concurrently onto system’s available resources. Workflows exhibit different characteristics e.g., topological structure, size and computation-communication demands while they can have different or conflicting optimization goals. The above results in scheduling decisions of high complexity which in turn may adversely affect the quality of solutions. In this paper we present a fast scheduling algorithm (i.e., the Multiple Workflow Complementary Packing algorithm, MWCP algorithm) for the management of multiple workflows. MWCP combines list scheduling methodologies and Bin Packing techniques to minimize the overall execution time of the workflows. For each workflow the scheduler decides on the best policy considering only the information provided by the workflow in question. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using real workflow applications being tested under different system heterogeneity levels. Results indicate that performance gains over existing studies are up to 9% while different workflow characteristics reveal different trade-offs on the performance of MWCP.",

Unfortunately, this status was greatly affected due to the influence of climate change and the deteriorating water quality and declining fishing stocks. Thus, fish farmers and aquaculture researchers have been searching for new and innovative technologies that could be used to address climate change issues. One of these technologies is the use of Biofloc systems. This technology uses a zero-water-exchange, and it also accumulates microorganisms that serve as a food source for the species. In view of the complexity of the process, the use of water quality management is highly recommended. In this purview, this study aimed to design and develop a solar powered automated water management system for a biofloc production. Hence, the iterative and incremental models were used for the software development process. The prototype was fabricated using the Internet of things framework composed of a mobile app which has the following features: account management, fish/shrimp profile, water quality management, auto feeding and manual controls. Based on the results of the study, the mobile app successfully sends alert values to the Arduino controller, serving as a reference in activating the corresponding relays for managing the dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and temp level. Thus, maintaining the water quality parameters are vital for the biofloc process.",

The existing methods are studied, and the residual time series convolutional neural network algorithm is proposed to be used in the tool wear prediction. This method first extracts features from the collected sensor data, and obtains the current state of the tool through related features. Then choose different input historical data sequence length and output future data sequence length to train the model.

Therefore, it becomes vital to observe the web activities of kids by the parents. The lack of parental control, guidance & inability of parents to monitor their kids throughout the whole time frame motivated us to style and develop a parental control and management tool. Initially, we conducted a background study to understand the state-of-the-art tools currently available in the market and compare those tools in terms of functionality, accuracy, efficiency, usability, and security. We also studied the benchmark requirements set by the parents and the freedom of access expressed by the children. We have implemented a front-end solution and an Android App that follows the default criteria set by us. As the internet is a highly dynamic space, we have used a Machine Learning-based approach to classify the website dynamically to provide dynamicity to the tool. The very basic idea is to scrape a website's content once the user enters the URL and then apply an appropriate algorithm to classify the same, essentially converting the problem into a multi-class classification problem. The result indicates that our tool efficiently blocks inappropriate content and facilitates parents with features to control and monitor their children's online activity and help mitigate the risk of cyber threats for children of the current age.",

For high-resolution imaging logging, it is particularly sensitive to depth errors, because their borehole images will be used for subsequent quantitative calculations of dip. Therefore, depth correction must be performed during the preprocessing of logging data, and accurate determination of the stuck section is a key step for depth correction and obtaining clear images. [Process and method] this article introduced a twice traversal well section identification algorithm. Firstly, the accelerometer measurement value is low-pass filtered through a Gaussian filter, and then the actual acceleration value of the tool along the well axis is calculated. Secondly, the Kalman model is constructed to calculate the movement speed of the tool in the well. Finally, the initial judgment of the stuck sections is made according to the accelerometer and velocity of the tool. On this basis, the section with short stuck intervals is further identified by using the correlation of images between pads, and finally, the stuck identification curve of the whole well is output. [Conclusion] through the verification of actual logging data processing, this method can accurately identify the stuck section and process the stuck intervals with duration ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes, which provides a reliable basis for speed correction.",

Explainability is a topic that has been proven to work on human interpretable data like images or sentences, but the research is narrow whenever such data is missing.  Creating trust through explainability on raw data processing neural networks of any kind will become necessary in the future as networks are evolving further towards artificial general intelligence.  This research is focused to visualize parts of the hidden layers instead of focusing explainability on the input data and is independent of the neural network’s size. We create a model that represents the neural network in a way that neurons that are activating on similar features are grouped together in structures. This model will be analyzed in a machine-learning equivalent process to identify parts of the network being responsible for a decision.  In a further step we use the model to test the processing of raw sensor-data versus an approach of heatmapped explainability with a convolutional neural network. Relevant data points in the input are visualized by a common heatmap approach while the hidden layers are analyzed in this research and should point to structures that have a comparable function in the network. For example, if the heatmap highlights peaks of values, the model will be highlighted in the area that is observed as the activation of the neural network on peaks. We will provide the research of artificial general intelligence with a solution for explainability which is necessary for advanced research and the operation of such applications in complex or dangerous scenarios.",

Name-based information delivery provides efficient, timely dissemination of relevant content to first responder teams assigned to different incident response roles. People increasingly depend on social media for communicating vital information, using free-form text. Thus, a method that delivers these social media posts to the right first responders can significantly improve outcomes. In this paper, we propose FLARE, a framework using 'Social Media Engines' (SMEs) to map social media posts (SMPs), such as tweets, to the right names. SMEs perform natural language processing-based classification and exploit several machine learning capabilities, in an online real-time manner. To reduce the manual labeling effort required for learning during the disaster, we leverage active learning, complemented by dispatchers with specific domain-knowledge performing limited labeling. We also leverage federated learning across various public-safety departments with specialized knowledge to handle notifications related to their roles in a cooperative manner. We implement three different classifiers: for incident relevance, organization, and fine-grained role prediction. Each class is associated with a specific subset of the namespace graph. The novelty of our system is the integration of the namespace with federated active learning and inference procedures to identify and deliver vital SMPs to the right first responders in a distributed multi-organization environment, in real-time. Our experiments using real-world data, including tweets generated by citizens during the wildfires in California in 2018, show our approach outperforming both a simple keyword-based classification and several existing NLP-based classification techniques.",

Since its source codes are usually unavailable, software reuse is hard to be detected with interpretation. On the other hand, current approaches suffer from poor detection accuracy and efficiency, far from satisfying practical demands. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose ISRD, an interpretation-enabled software reuse detection approach based on a multi-level birthmark model that contains function level, basic block level, and instruction level. To overcome obfuscation caused by cross-compilation, we represent function semantics with Minimum Branch Path (MBP) and perform normalization to extract core semantics of instructions. For efficiently detecting reused functions, a process for \"intent search based on anchor recognition\" is designed to speed up reuse detection. It uses strict instruction match and identical library call invocation check to find anchor functions (in short anchors) and then traverses neighbors of the anchors to explore potentially matched function pairs. Extensive experiments based on two real-world binary datasets reveal that ISRD is interpretable, effective, and efficient, which achieves 97.2% precision and 94.8% recall. Moreover, it is resilient to cross-compilation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

In order to more efficiently manage big seismic data, this work explores a computationally cheaper network with the use of 2D orthogonal planes convolutional neural networks for 3D seismic cube facies classification and lithostratigrafic groups, supported by an heuristic based on geological principles, which is one of the steps of reservoir characterization and oil and gas exploration. We proposed a 2D to 3D transfer learning in which we split the training samples of our 3D data as 3 orthogonal slices and convert the trained parameters to a 3D counterpart of the network, with each direction of the training planes conveniently converted to a 3D convolution, based on geological insights. Through a sampling method that captures spacial information of seismic data, the proposed model was applied in the synthetic data of the Stanford VI-E reservoir and the real seismic data of F3-block dataset. Compared to other models in the same benchmark, the proposed AH-Net Ensemble classifier, with a geological heuristic obtained better results than other architectures of literature with a very feasible computational cost in both datasets, which suggests that such approach is a promising one and of easy replication, since it can be seamlessly applied to any network architecture.",

A common understanding of genre is that it relates to the content of books, but this resource allows us to view genre as an intersection of user communities and reader values and interests. We explore different methods of computational genre measurement within the open space of user-created tags. We measure overlap between books, tags, and users, and we also measure the homogeneity of communities associated with genre tags and correlate this homogeneity with reviewing behavior.Finally, by analyzing the text of reviews, we identify the thematic signatures of genres on LibraryThing, revealing similarities and differences between them. These measurements are intended to elucidate the genre conceptions of the users, not, as in prior work, to normalize the tags or enforce a hierarchy. We find that LibraryThing users make sense of genre through a variety of values and expectations, many of which fall outside common definitions and understandings of genre.",

Buildings now generate an enormous amount of data, and the collection and analysis of such data is useful for detecting faults. However, fault detection approaches are not optimal in buildings due to several challenges. Data for fault detection is not readily available because of poor data collection practices and often when data is available, the data quality is inadequate to have useful models for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). We propose a workflow for data-driven fault detection and diagnosis to deal with some of these challenges.

We present two new methods for in-processor distribution representations which are approximations of probability distributions just as floating-point number representations are approximations of real-valued numbers. Laplace executes unmodified RISC-V binaries and can track uncertainty through them. We present two sets of ISA extensions to provide a mechanism to initialize distributional information in the microarchitecture and to allow applications to query statistics of the distributional information without exposing the uncertainty representations above the ISA.  We evaluate the accuracy and performance of Laplace using a suite of 21 benchmarks spanning domains ranging from variational quantum algorithms and sensor data processing to materials properties modeling. Monte Carlo simulation on the benchmarks requires 2 076 × more instructions on average (and up to 21 343 × in some cases) to achieve the same accuracy that Laplace can achieve in a single execution. Compared to state-of-the-art alternatives to Monte Carlo, Laplace achieves an average 1.3 × accuracy improvement versus PaCAL [22] and more than 4.6 × accuracy improvement versus the method used by the NIST Uncertainty Machine [26], quantified using the Wasserstein distance to Monte Carlo.  Unlike existing methods for uncertainty tracking which require software to be rewritten in a domain-specific language or extensive source-level changes, Laplace achieves all of these benefits while requiring no changes to existing binaries in order to track uncertainty through them, with only minimal changes required to get uncertainty information into the microarchitecture. We have deployed an implementation of Laplace as a commercial product in the form of a cloud-accessible virtual machine.",

Incorporating the label correlations into the model is one of the increasingly studied areas in the last decade, mostly due to its potential in training more accurate predictive models and dealing with noisy/missing labels. Previously, multi-label learning classifier systems have been proposed that incorporate the high-order label correlations into the model through the label powerset (LP) technique. However, such a strategy cannot take advantage of the valuable statistical information in the label space to make more accurate inferences. Such information becomes even more crucial in ML image classification problems where the number of labels can be very large. In this paper, we propose a multi-label learning classifier system that leverages a structured representation for the labels through undirected graphs to utilize the label similarities when evolving rules. More specifically, we propose a novel scheme for covering classifier actions, as well as a method to calculate ML prediction arrays. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by experimenting on multiple benchmark datasets and comparing the results with multiple well-known ML classification algorithms.",

UA-DEVS models provide a theoretical framework to describe the models’ uncertainty and their properties. As UA-DEVS models can include continuous variables and non-computable functions, their simulation could be non-computable. For this reason, we also introduce Interval-Approximated Discrete-Event System Specification (IA-DEVS), a formalism that approximates UA-DEVS models using a set of order and bounding functions to obtain a computable model. The computable model approximation produces a tree of all trajectories that can be traversed from the original model and some erroneous ones introduced by the approximation process.

To this end, we present \\(\\), a semantic Conversational Search and Recommendation (CSR) system able to suggest pertinent IF-THEN rules that can be easily deployed in different contexts starting from an abstract user’s need. By exploiting a conversational agent, the user can communicate her current personalization intention by specifying a set of functionality at a high level, e.g., to decrease the temperature of a room when she left it. Stemming from this input, \\(\\) implements a semantic recommendation process that takes into account (a) the current user’s intention, (b) the connected entities owned by the user, and (c) the user’s long-term preferences revealed by her profile. If not satisfied with the suggestions, then the user can converse with the system to provide further feedback, i.e., a short-term preference, thus allowing \\(\\) to provide refined recommendations that better align with the original intention. We evaluate \\(\\) by running different offline experiments with simulated users and real-world data. First, we test the recommendation process in different configurations, and we show that recommendation accuracy and similarity with target items increase as the interaction between the algorithm and the user proceeds. Then, we compare \\(\\) with other similar baseline recommender systems. Results are promising and demonstrate the effectiveness of \\(\\) in recommending IF-THEN rules that satisfy the current personalization intention of the user.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are complex systems that must satisfy multiple requirements such as safety, compliance to traffic rules, and comfortableness. However, satisfying all these requirements may not always be possible due to emerging environmental conditions. Therefore, the ADSs may have to make trade-offs among multiple requirements during the ongoing operation, resulting in one or more requirements violations. For ADS engineers, it is highly important to know which combinations of requirements violations may occur, as different combinations can expose different types of failures. However, there is currently no testing approach that can generate scenarios to expose different combinations of requirements violations. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the notion of requirements violation pattern to characterize a specific combination of requirements violations. Based on this notion, we propose a testing approach named EMOOD that can effectively generate test scenarios to expose as many requirements violation patterns as possible. EMOOD uses a prioritization technique to sort all possible patterns to search for, from the most to the least critical ones. Then, EMOOD iteratively includes an evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm to find different combinations of requirements violations. In each iteration, the targeted pattern is determined by a dynamic prioritization technique to give preferences to those patterns with higher criticality and higher likelihood to occur. We apply EMOOD to an industrial ADS under two common traffic situations. Evaluation results show that EMOOD outperforms three baseline approaches in generating test scenarios by discovering more requirements violation patterns.",

One solution is to estimate the operator’s speech intelligibility to their listeners in order to provide feedback about it to the operator. This work contributes the first evaluation of a speech intelligibility feedback system for homebound K-12 students attending class remotely. In our four long-term, in-the-wild deployments we found that students speak at different volumes instead of adjusting the robot’s volume, and that detailed audio calibration and network latency feedback are needed. We also contribute the first findings about the types and frequencies of multimodal comprehension cues given to homebound students by listeners in the classroom. By annotating and categorizing over 700 cues, we found that the most common cue modalities were conversation turn timing and verbal content. Conversation turn timing cues occurred more frequently overall, whereas verbal content cues contained more information and might be the most frequent modality for negative cues. Our work provides recommendations for telepresence systems that could intervene to ensure that remote users are being heard.",

A Personalized Learning Environment (PLE) that automatically adapts to learner characteristics such as learning styles and knowledge level can recommend appropriate learning resources that would favor the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The pure cold-start problem is a relevant issue in PLEs, which arises due to the lack of prior information about the new learner in the PLE to create appropriate recommendations. This article introduces a semantic framework based on ontology to address the pure cold-start problem in content recommenders. The ontology encapsulates the domain knowledge about the learners as well as Learning Objects (LOs). The semantic model that we built has been experimented with different combinations of the key learner parameters such as learning style, knowledge level, and background knowledge. The proposed framework utilizes these parameters to build natural learner groups from the learner ontology using SPARQL queries. The ontology holds 480 learners’ data, 468 annotated learning objects with 5,600 learner ratings. A multivariate k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping similar data, is used to evaluate the learner similarity computation accuracy. The learner satisfaction achieved with the proposed model is measured based on the ratings given by the 40 participants of the experiments. From the evaluation perspective, it is evident that 79% of the learners are satisfied with the recommendations generated by the proposed model in pure cold-start condition.",

Driven by the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, intelligent psychological pressure detection systems based on deep learning and wearable devices have acquired some good results in practical application. However, existing studies argue that the psychological stress state is influenced by the current environment. They put much attention on the momentary features but ignore the dynamic change process of mental status in the time dimension. Besides, the lack of research in the general laws of psychological stress makes it difficult to quantitatively evaluate the stress status, resulting in the inability to perceive the stress state of users effectively. Thus, this article proposes an evaluation mechanism of psychological stress for adjusting the mental status of users. Specifically, we design a multi-dimensional feature space and a time-aware feature encoder, which integrate various stress features and capture time characteristics of stress state change. Moreover, a novel mental state model is proposed, which uses the pressure features with time characteristics to evaluate the pressure stress level. This model also quantifies the internal relationship between pressure features. Last, we establish a practicable testbed to demonstrate how to evaluate and adjust mental state of users by the proposed evaluation mechanism of psychological stress.",

In this paper, we adopt a concept from the computational learning theory, Occam learning, and perform a comprehensive study on the framework of synthesis through unification (STUN), a state-of-the-art framework for synthesizing programs with nested if-then-else operators. We prove that Eusolver, a state-of-the-art STUN solver, does not satisfy the condition of Occam learning, and then we design a novel STUN solver, PolyGen, of which the generalizability is theoretically guaranteed by Occam learning. We evaluate PolyGen on the domains of CLIA and demonstrate that PolyGen significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art PBE solvers on CLIA, Eusolver and Euphony, on both generalizability and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different application domains, so that we can identify best practices, potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk detection. We identified sexual grooming (75%), sex trafficking (12%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12%) as the three types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature. Furthermore, we found that the majority (93%) of this work has focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public datasets (82%) and third-party annotators (33%) to establish ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of this work (78%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance evaluation of their model and rarely (4%) evaluate these systems with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.",

In sensitive domains (e.g. financial accounts, hospital health records), entity resolution must meet privacy requirements to avoid revealing sensitive information such as personal identifiable information to untrusted parties. Existing solutions are either too algorithmically-specific or come with an implicit trade-off between accuracy of the computation, privacy, and run-time efficiency. We propose AMMPERE, an abstract computation model for performing universal privacy-preserving entity resolution. AMMPERE offers abstractions that encapsulate multiple algorithmic and platform-agnostic approaches using variants of Jaccard similarity to perform private data matching and entity resolution. Specifically, we show that two parties can perform entity resolution over their data, without leaking sensitive information. We rigorously compare and analyze the feasibility, performance overhead and privacy-preserving properties of these approaches on the Sharemind multi-party computation (MPC) platform as well as on PALISADE, a lattice-based homomorphic encryption library. The AMMPERE system demonstrates the efficacy of privacy-preserving entity resolution for real-world data while providing a precise characterization of the induced cost of preventing information leakage.",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants at the end of a 12-week cognitive stimulation games intervention delivered entirely on robots. Participants were 10 older adults purposively sampled from two retirement villages. A framework analysis approach was used to code data to predefined themes related to technology acceptance (perceived benefits, satisfaction, and preference), and usability (effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction). Results indicated that cognitive games delivered on a robot may be a valuable addition to existing cognitive stimulation activities. The robot was considered easy to use and useful in improving cognitive functioning. Future developments should incorporate interactive gaming tools, the use of social anthropomorphic robots, contrasting colour schemes to accommodate macular degeneration, and cultural-specific imagery and language. This will help cater to the preferences and age-related health needs of older adults, to ultimately enhance usability and acceptability.",

To circumvent this problem, a solution is to actively take actions to perceive what is of interest to the agent, for example, in a computer vision system, the camera can be repositioned to have a better view of an object. This work aims to develop an active perception model integrated with the reasoning cycle of BDI agents.

Beside that, new issues are emerging related to vulnerabilities in the Internet, which can affect not only virtual environments in an isolated way but this can have serious repercussions in the real world. That is why, the identification of new system vulnerabilities represents an important information for malicious parties. Currently, several tools, known as Online Public Scanning Tools (OPSTs) represent for attackers an attractive source of information from which to draw in order to plan and launch attacks. Indeed, they can automatically scan services, platforms and IoT devices connected to the Internet in order to retrieve information related to them, by including those related to vulnerabilities. In this context, this work aims to investigate how such OPSTs impact the launch of attacks on the network. To this purpose, a model centered on 3 main actors, (i.e. the attack, the hacker and the OPST) has been proposed by defining a set of features which aims to support the evaluation. Shodan was chosen as the OPST, as it is the most popular based on the related review works, while a honey-based approach was adopted to support monitoring and information extraction related to attacks. The results of these analyzes, which show how Shodan influence the attackers in carrying out network attacks are presented and discussed.",

These days, visitors can access reliable CH content using Web and mobile-based interfaces. However, conventional CH systems still lack the ability to provide meaningful semantically overt results that precisely meet user information needs in this domain. In addition, they often ignore the user search context and experience, which hinders their ability to adapt their behavior to the preferences, tasks, interests, and other user functionalities. In this article, we aim to address the issue of designing a precision-oriented multilingual and multi-criteria semantic-based mobile recommender system specifically targeting Palestine's CH, a country with great historical and cultural importance. We aim to better facilitate users’ access to CH content by providing them with multiple search functionalities. In this context, a user can search for relevant information using keywords (a.k.a. tags) or sentence-like queries and the system retrieves all relevant documents based on their semantic similarity. A second option is to search using current location information to retrieve correlated historical places and events. Finally, starting from a picture of interest, a third option makes it possible to extract captions describing its content that can be used to search for additional contextually relevant information. Additionally, the proposed system aims at personalizing users’ experience through progressively delivering output that meets their information needs based on a number of parameters such as users' logging data, interests, previous searches, and location-based information. A prototype of the proposed system has been developed and tested using Android smartphones and a manually constructed ontology enriched with CH links to the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and DBpedia. By comparing our system with similar systems in this domain, findings demonstrate that it provides additional search features and functionalities to users. The proposed Holy-Land ontology is the first of its kind attempting to encode knowledge about Palestine's CH. It plays a crucial role in our proposal, serving as a pivotal entity in the combination of language-based, location-based, and visual-based retrieval strategies.",

        "abstract": "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been widely used for topic modeling, with applications spanning various areas such as natural language processing and information retrieval. While LDA on small and static datasets has been extensively studied, several real-world challenges are posed in practical scenarios where datasets are often huge and are gathered in a streaming fashion. As the state-of-the-art LDA algorithm on streams, Streaming Variational Bayes (SVB) introduced Bayesian updating to provide a streaming procedure. However, the utility of SVB is limited in applications since it ignored three challenges of processing real-world streams: topic evolution, data turbulence, and real-time inference. In this article, we propose a novel distributed LDA algorithm—referred to as StreamFed-LDA—to deal with challenges on streams. For topic modeling of streaming data, the ability to capture evolving topics is essential for practical online inference. To achieve this goal, StreamFed-LDA is based on a specialized framework that supports lifelong (continual) learning of evolving topics. On the other hand, data turbulence is commonly present in streams due to real-life events. In that case, the design of StreamFed-LDA allows the model to learn new characteristics from the most recent data while maintaining the historical information. On massive streaming data, it is difficult and crucial to provide real-time inference results. To increase the throughput and reduce the latency, StreamFed-LDA introduces additional techniques that substantially reduce both computation and communication costs in distributed systems. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance of online inference compared with the baselines. At the same time, StreamFed-LDA also reduces the latency by orders of magnitudes in real-world datasets.",

We evaluate Lux in terms of usability via interviews with early adopters, finding that Lux helps fulfill the needs of data scientists for visualization support within their dataframe workflows.

These practitioners share many of the same ML development difficulties and ethical conundrums as their Big Tech counterparts; however, their experiences are subject to additional under-studied challenges stemming from deploying ML with limited resources, increased existential risk, and absent access to in-house research teams. We contribute a qualitative analysis of 17 interviews with stakeholders from organizations which are less represented in prior studies. We uncover a number of tensions which are introduced or exacerbated by these organizations' resource constraints---tensions between privacy and ubiquity, resource management and performance optimization, and access and monopolization.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, static power consumption in chip multiprocessor (CMP) is the most crucial concern of chip designers. Power-gating is an effective approach to mitigate static power consumption particularly in low utilization. Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the backbone of multi- and many-core chips has no exception. Previous state-of-the-art techniques in power-gating desire to decrease static power consumption alongside the lack of diminution in performance of NoC. However, maintaining the performance and utilization of the power-gating approach has not yet been addressed very well. In this article, we propose TAMA (Turn-Aware Mapping & Architecture) as an effective method to boost the performance of the TooT method that was only powering on a router during turning pass or packet injection. In other words, in the TooT method, straight and eject packets pass the router via a bypass route without powering on the router. By employing meta-heuristic approaches (Genetic and Ant Colony algorithms), we develop a specific application mapping that attempts to decrease the number of turns through interconnection networks. Accordingly, the average latency of packet transmission decreases due to fewer turns. Also, by powering on turn routers in advance with lightweight hardware, the latency of sending packets diminishes. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach, i.e., TAMA achieves more than 13% reduction in packet latency of NoC in comparison with TooT. Besides the packet latency, the power consumption of TAMA is reduced by about 87% compared to the traditional approach.",

This process is impacted by people's emotional reactions to their data. While seeking support from others can be an effective strategy for overcoming these emotional challenges, self-trackers face unique barriers in sharing their personal data. Our study investigates 1) how users seek out support online for emotional barriers elicited by their self-tracking data and 2) what self-described impact this sharing has on their self-tracking practices. To investigate these topics, we analyzed discussions in two online communities on Reddit.com centered around infertility and trying to conceive that consistently describe self-tracking experiences. We found that community members described three distinct driving emotional tensions with their self-tracking data. In seeking community input, users were focused on support for understanding and acting upon their feelings and emotions. Even when data was uncertain, frustrating, or viewed as inaccurate, comparing and learning with others benefited users through feelings of connection, control, and humor this collective sense-making provided. Additionally, we found that users taking breaks from self-tracking in whole or part appeared to support their emotional well-being and long-term motivation to track. Based on these findings, we conclude that self-tracking data has social and emotional value beyond perceived accuracy and individual treatment goals.",

Nowadays, information and communication technologies are ubiquitous and pervasive and have greatly promoted the development of cultural tourism. Cultural tourism should utilize these technologies to improve a sense of participation and experience for cultural tourists by sorting out domain-specific cultural knowledge from tourism attractions systematically, building bridges between tourism resources and cultural connotation naturally and presenting the cultural changes behind tourism resources vividly. To the end, we present a complete framework that is suitable to event retrieval of cultural tourism, helping cultural tourists learn culture in all directions and in depth quickly and easily before their cultural tours, and local government create tourism cards through the dissemination of culture connotation as well. Our main inspiration is that story-telling would be an effective form of acceptance by cultural tourists to spread the culture behind tourism resources. Concretely, our framework includes data acquisition and preprocessing, data organization and processing, and data visualization components. The data acquisition and preprocessing component is responsible for collecting historical event texts and fusing text knowledge. The data organization and processing component enables an intuitive view on properties and relations of the event elements in terms of defined event ontology for cultural tourism and supports event semantic retrieval.

Many intelligent systems have been developing, considering uncertainties in the cloud. Intelligent approaches with the consideration of uncertainties bring optimal management with higher profitability. Uncertainties of different levels and different types exist in various domains of cloud computing. This survey aims to discuss all types of uncertainties and their effect on different components of cloud computing. The article first presents the concept of uncertainty and its quantification. A vast number of uncertain events influence the cloud, as it is connected with the entire world through the internet. Five major uncertain parameters are identified, which are directly affected by numerous uncertain events and affect the performance of the cloud. Notable events affecting major uncertain parameters are also described. Besides, we present notable uncertainty-aware research works in cloud computing. A hype curve on uncertainty-aware approaches in the cloud is also presented to visualize current conditions and future possibilities. We expect the inauguration of numerous uncertainty-aware intelligent systems in cloud management over time. This article may provide a deeper understanding of managing cloud resources with uncertainties efficiently to future cloud researchers.",

        "abstract": "Due to the number of constraints and the dynamic nature of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), effective video broadcasting always remains a difficult task. In this work, we proposed a quality of video visualization guarantee model based on a feedback loop and an efficient algorithm for segmenting and replicating video segments using the Payoff-based Dynamic Segment Replication Policy (P-DSR). In the urban VANET environment, P-DSR is defined by taking into account the position of the vehicles, the speed, the direction, the number of neighboring vehicles, and the reputation of each node to stabilize the urban VANET topology. However, the management of various load control parameters between the different components of the urban VANET network remains a problem to be studied. This work uses a multi-objective problem that takes the parameters of our algorithm based on the Graph Classification Method with Attribute Vectors (GCMAV) as input. This algorithm aims to provide an improved class lifetime, an improved video segment delivery rate, a reduced inter-class overload, and an optimization of a global criterion. A scalable algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the GCMAV. The simulations were carried out using the NetSim simulator and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms framework to optimize parameters. Experiments were carried out with realistic maps of Open Street Maps and its results were compared with other algorithms such as Seamless and Authorized Multimedia Streaming and P-DSR. The survey suggests that the proposed methodology works well concerning the average lifetime of the inter-classes and the delivery rate of video segments.",

While examples of this work abound, comparatively little theory exists for grasping alternative designs, and for explicating their relation to other types of design and to design in general. In response this paper develops the key concepts of progressional design, frictional design, and design as prefiguration. The progressional conceptualization of design holds that designs have a primary purpose, and that purpose is to ultimately converge toward and ideally arrive at production. The frictional conceptualization of design radically relaxes teleological assumptions and productional expectations. Frictional designs prefigure possibilities that are compellingly resistant to further progression and final production. Prefiguration grounds both progression and friction in the idea that designs are partial, provisional, and potentially preliminary actualizations of possible futures. To illustrate frictional design, this paper outlines a framework of 5 frictional tendencies: diverging, opposing, accelerating, counterfactualizing, and analogizing. These tendencies represent ways in which frictional designs are directionally in tension with the arrow-like vector of progressional design. Several additional concepts are discussed in conclusion to further explicate more nuanced relational potentials between friction and progression: transproductional uses, teleological ambiguity, and relational multiplicity.",

We show that such information, including all previous passwords and tokens, remains on the flash memory, even after a factory reset. This is due to the wear-leveling algorithms of the flash memory and lack of encryption. We identify and discuss the design flaws in the storage of sensitive information and the process of de-provisioning used devices. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of such attacks on 86 used devices purchased on eBay and flea markets. Finally, we propose secure design alternatives and mitigation techniques.",

        "abstract": "We focus on the problem of reliably training Reinforcement Learning (RL) models (agents) for stable low-level control in embedded systems and test our methods on a high-performance, custom-built quadrotor platform. A common but often under-studied problem in developing RL agents for continuous control is that the control policies developed are not always smooth. This lack of smoothness can be a major problem when learning controllers as it can result in control instability and hardware failure.Issues of noisy control are further accentuated when training RL agents in simulation due to simulators ultimately being imperfect representations of reality—what is known as the reality gap. To combat issues of instability in RL agents, we propose a systematic framework, REinforcement-based transferable Agents through Learning (RE+AL), for designing simulated training environments that preserve the quality of trained agents when transferred to real platforms. RE+AL is an evolution of the Neuroflight infrastructure detailed in technical reports prepared by members of our research group. Neuroflight is a state-of-the-art framework for training RL agents for low-level attitude control. RE+AL improves and completes Neuroflight by solving a number of important limitations that hindered the deployment of Neuroflight to real hardware. We benchmark RE+AL on the NF1 racing quadrotor developed as part of Neuroflight. We demonstrate that RE+AL significantly mitigates the previously observed issues of smoothness in RL agents. Additionally, RE+AL is shown to consistently train agents that are flight capable and with minimal degradation in controller quality upon transfer. RE+AL agents also learn to perform better than a tuned PID controller, with better tracking errors, smoother control, and reduced power consumption. To the best of our knowledge, RE+AL agents are the first RL-based controllers trained in simulation to outperform a well-tuned PID controller on a real-world controls problem that is solvable with classical control.",

The proposed visualization concept, called ExpanDrogram, is designed to support dynamic classifiers that run in a big data environment subject to changes in data characteristics. It offers a wide range of features that seek to maximize the customization of a segmentation problem. The main goal of the ExpanDrogram visualization is to improve comprehensiveness by combining both the individual and segment levels, illustrating the dynamics of the segmentation process over time, providing “version control” that enables the user to observe the history of changes, and more. The method is illustrated using different datasets, with which we demonstrate multiple segmentation parameters, as well as multiple display layers, to highlight points such as new trend detection, outlier detection, tracking changes in original segments, and zoom in/out for more/less detail.

With the emergence of cloud computing, BPMS deployment considerations are shifting from traditional on-premise models to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigm, aiming at delivering Business Process Automation as a Service. However, scaling up a traditional BPMS to cope with simultaneous demand from multiple organisations in the cloud is challenging, since its underlying system architecture has been designed to serve a single organisation with a single process engine. Moreover, the complexity in addressing both the dynamic execution environment and the elasticity requirements of users impose further challenges to deploying a traditional BPMS in the cloud. A typical SaaS often deploys multiple instances of its core applications and distributes workload to these application instances via load balancing. But, for stateful and often long-running process instances, standard stateless load balancing strategies are inadequate. In this article, we propose a conceptual design of BPMS capable of addressing dynamically varying demands of end users in the cloud, and present a prototypical implementation using an open source traditional BPMS platform. Both the design and system realisation offer focused strategies on achieving scalability and demonstrates the system capabilities for supporting both upscaling, to address large volumes of user demand or workload, and downscaling, to release underutilised computing resources, in a cloud environment.",

Edge performance benchmarking is a nascent research avenue that has started gaining momentum over the past five years. This article first reviews articles published over the past three decades to trace the history of performance benchmarking from tightly coupled to loosely coupled systems.

We propose an efficient tree-search algorithm to calculate the exact MLE of model parameters, study statistical properties of the model both analytically and through simulation, and apply our model to real data from an instance of grant panel review that collected both scores and partial rankings. Furthermore, we demonstrate how model outputs can be used to rank objects with confidence.

Utilizing machine learning methods combined with well-designed features, we could automatically obtain video summarization to relax video resource consumption and retrieval issues. However, there always exists a gap between the summarization obtained by the model and the ones annotated by users. How to help users understand the difference, provide insights in improving the model, and enhance the trust in the model remains challenging in the current study. To address these challenges, we propose VSumVis under a user-centered design methodology, a visual analysis system with multi-feature examination and multi-level exploration, which could help users explore and analyze video content, as well as the intrinsic relationship that existed in our video summarization model. The system contains multiple coordinated views, i.e., video view, projection view, detail view, and sequential frames view. A multi-level analysis process to integrate video events and frames are presented with clusters and nodes visualization in our system. Temporal patterns concerning the difference between the manual annotation score and the saliency score produced by our model are further investigated and distinguished with sequential frames view. Moreover, we propose a set of rich user interactions that enable an in-depth, multi-faceted analysis of the features in our video summarization model. We conduct case studies and interviews with domain experts to provide anecdotal evidence about the effectiveness of our approach. Quantitative feedback from a user study confirms the usefulness of our visual system for exploring the video summarization model.",

However, achieving effective involvement of users requires improving their privacy decision-making. This can be achieved by: (i) raising their awareness regarding the direct and indirect privacy risks they accept to take when sharing data with consumers; (ii) helping them in optimizing their privacy protection decisions to meet their privacy requirements while maximizing data utility. In this article, we address the second goal by proposing a user-centric multi-objective approach for context-aware privacy management in connected environments, denoted δ-Risk. Our approach features a new privacy risk quantification model to dynamically calculate and select the best protection strategies for the user based on her preferences and contexts. Computed strategies are optimal in that they seek to closely satisfy user requirements and preferences while maximizing data utility and minimizing the cost of protection. We implemented our proposed approach and evaluated its performance and effectiveness in various scenarios. The results show that δ-Risk delivers scalability and low-complexity in time and space. Besides, it handles privacy reasoning in real-time, making it able to support the user in various contexts, including ephemeral ones. It also provides the user with at least one best strategy per context.",

        "abstract": "When humans interact with intelligent systems, their causal responsibility for outcomes becomes equivocal. We analyze the descriptive abilities of a newly developed responsibility quantification model (ResQu) to predict actual human responsibility and perceptions of responsibility in the interaction with intelligent systems. In two laboratory experiments, participants performed a classification task. They were aided by classification systems with different capabilities. We compared the predicted theoretical responsibility values to the actual measured responsibility participants took on and to their subjective rankings of responsibility. The model predictions were strongly correlated with both measured and subjective responsibility. Participants’ behavior with each system was influenced by the system and human capabilities, but also by the subjective perceptions of these capabilities and the perception of the participant's own contribution. A bias existed only when participants with poor classification capabilities relied less than optimally on a system that had superior classification capabilities and assumed higher-than-optimal responsibility. The study implies that when humans interact with advanced intelligent systems, with capabilities that greatly exceed their own, their comparative causal responsibility will be small, even if formally the human is assigned major roles. Simply putting a human into the loop does not ensure that the human will meaningfully contribute to the outcomes. The results demonstrate the descriptive value of the ResQu model to predict behavior and perceptions of responsibility by considering the characteristics of the human, the intelligent system, the environment, and some systematic behavioral biases. The ResQu model is a new quantitative method that can be used in system design and can guide policy and legal decisions regarding human responsibility in events involving intelligent systems.",

The inputs generated by the symbolic execution using the byte-level symbolization are usually rejected by the parsing program, which dooms the effectiveness and efficiency of symbolic execution. Complex parsing programs usually adopt token-based input grammar checking. A token sequence represents one case of the input grammar. Based on this observation, we propose grammar-agnostic symbolic execution that can automatically generate token sequences to test complex parsing programs effectively and efficiently. Our method's key idea is to symbolize tokens instead of input bytes to improve the efficiency of symbolic execution. Technically, we propose a novel two-stage algorithm: the first stage collects the byte-level constraints of token values; the second stage employs token symbolization and the constraints collected in the first stage to generate the program inputs that are more possible to pass the parsing code.   We have implemented our method on a Java Pathfinder (JPF) based concolic execution engine. The results of the extensive experiments on real-world Java parsing programs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency in testing complex parsing programs. Our method detects 6 unknown bugs in the benchmark programs and achieves orders of magnitude speedup to find the same bugs.",

The algorithms enabling swarms allow individual robots of the swarm to plan, share, and coordinate their trajectories and tasks to achieve a common goal.

This large configuration space, the complexity of the algorithms, and the dependencies with the robots’ setup and performance make debugging and fixing swarms configuration bugs extremely challenging. This paper proposes Swarmbug, a swarm debugging system that automatically diagnoses and fixes buggy behaviors caused by misconfiguration. The essence of Swarmbug is the novel concept called the degree of causal contribution (Dcc), which abstracts impacts of environment configurations (e.g., obstacles) to the drones in a swarm via behavior causal analysis. Swarmbug automatically generates, validates, and ranks fixes for configuration bugs. We evaluate Swarmbug on four diverse swarm algorithms. Swarmbug successfully fixes four configuration bugs in the evaluated algorithms, showing that it is generic and effective. We also conduct a real-world experiment with physical drones to show the Swarmbug’s fix is effective in the real-world.",

        "abstract": "The prosperous trend of deploying deep neural network (DNN) models to diverse hardware platforms has boosted the development of deep learning (DL) compilers. DL compilers take the high-level DNN model specifications as input and generate optimized DNN executables for diverse hardware architectures like CPUs, GPUs, and various hardware accelerators. Compiling DNN models into high-efficiency executables is not easy: the compilation procedure often involves converting high-level model specifications into several different intermediate representations (IR), e.g., graph IR and operator IR, and performing rule-based or learning-based optimizations from both platform-independent and platform-dependent perspectives. Despite the prosperous adoption of DL compilers in real-world scenarios, principled and systematic understanding toward the correctness of DL compilers does not yet exist. To fill this critical gap, this paper introduces MT-DLComp, a metamorphic testing framework specifically designed for DL compilers to effectively uncover erroneous compilations. Our approach leverages deliberately-designed metamorphic relations (MRs) to launch semantics-preserving mutations toward DNN models to generate their variants. This way, DL compilers can be automatically examined for compilation correctness utilizing DNN models and their variants without requiring manual intervention. We also develop a set of practical techniques to realize an effective workflow and localize identified error-revealing inputs. Real-world DL compilers exhibit a high level of engineering quality. Nevertheless, we detected over 435 inputs that can result in erroneous compilations in four popular DL compilers, all of which are industry-strength products maintained by Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. While the discovered error-triggering inputs do not cause the DL compilers to crash directly, they can lead to the generation of incorrect DNN executables. With substantial manual effort and help from the DL compiler developers, we uncovered four bugs in these DL compilers by debugging them using the error-triggering inputs. Our proposed testing frameworks and findings can be used to guide developers in their efforts to improve DL compilers.",

        "abstract": "High-level synthesis (HLS), which refers to the automatic compilation of software into hardware, is rapidly gaining popularity. In a world increasingly reliant on application-specific hardware accelerators, HLS promises hardware designs of comparable performance and energy efficiency to those coded by hand in a hardware description language such as Verilog, while maintaining the convenience and the rich ecosystem of software development. However, current HLS tools cannot always guarantee that the hardware designs they produce are equivalent to the software they were given, thus undermining any reasoning conducted at the software level. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that existing HLS tools are quite unreliable, sometimes generating wrong hardware or crashing when given valid inputs. To address this problem, we present the first HLS tool that is mechanically verified to preserve the behaviour of its input software. Our tool, called Vericert, extends the CompCert verified C compiler with a new hardware-oriented intermediate language and a Verilog back end, and has been proven correct in Coq. Vericert supports most C constructs, including all integer operations, function calls, local arrays, structs, unions, and general control-flow statements. An evaluation on the PolyBench/C benchmark suite indicates that Vericert generates hardware that is around an order of magnitude slower (only around 2× slower in the absence of division) and about the same size as hardware generated by an existing, optimising (but unverified) HLS tool.",

Some of these interventions, such as the use of warning messages, are examples of nudges---a choice-preserving technique to steer behavior. Despite their application, we do not know whether nudges could steer people into making conscious news credibility judgments online and if they do, under what constraints. To answer, we combine nudge techniques with heuristic based information processing to design NudgeCred--a browser extension for Twitter. NudgeCred directs users' attention to two design cues: authority of a source and other users' collective opinion on a report by activating three design nudges---Reliable, Questionable, and Unreliable, each denoting particular levels of credibility for news tweets. In a controlled experiment, we found that NudgeCred significantly helped users (n=430) distinguish news tweets' credibility, unrestricted by three behavioral confounds---political ideology, political cynicism, and media skepticism. A five-day field deployment with twelve participants revealed that NudgeCred improved their recognition of news items and attention towards all of our nudges, particularly towards Questionable. Among other considerations, participants proposed that designers should incorporate heuristics that users' would trust. Our work informs nudge-based system design approaches for online media.",

This gender gap in participation has resulted in a concern that the content suffers biases as a result of the bias in participation. This problem is hard to study, because the relationships between participation, gender identity, and content have not been established. Prior studies, mostly with children, have shown some differences in topical preferences based on sex. However, this issue has not been studied with adults and has not been considered from more than a binary stance. In this study, we work to understand how gender identity relates to topical preferences. Through an empirical study, we ask participants to declare a gender identity and then present them with pairs of topical article content from Wikipedia. Through thousands of participants and tens of thousands of paired content trials, we uncover relationships between self-declared gender identity and topical preferences. Further, by focusing on topics that have a statistically significant bias, we leverage two of Wikipedia's category systems to illustrate relative categorical differences that are similar to categorical differences described in prior work. The discussion focuses on the subtly of these differences, potential future research, and the implications for interventions based on topical content. Further, the results help us reflect on relationships that might explain the persistent and worsening gender gap in participation.",

The need for reliability raises a need for rigorous testing of the safety and trustworthiness of these systems. In the last few years, there have been a number of research efforts focused on testing DNNs. However the test generation techniques proposed so far lack a check to determine whether the test inputs they are generating are valid, and thus invalid inputs are produced. To illustrate this situation, we explored three recent DNN testing techniques. Using deep generative model based input validation, we show that all the three techniques generate significant number of invalid test inputs. We further analyzed the test coverage achieved by the test inputs generated by the DNN testing techniques and showed how invalid test inputs can falsely inflate test coverage metrics. To overcome the inclusion of invalid inputs in testing, we propose a technique to incorporate the valid input space of the DNN model under test in the test generation process. Our technique uses a deep generative model-based algorithm to generate only valid inputs. Results of our empirical studies show that our technique is effective in eliminating invalid tests and boosting the number of valid test inputs generated.",

Even nowadays, web testing still heavily relies on manual efforts while automated web testing is far from achieving human-level performance. Key challenges in web testing include dynamic content update and deep bugs hiding under complicated user interactions and specific input values, which can only be triggered by certain action sequences in the huge search space. In this paper, we propose WebExplor, an automatic end-to-end web testing framework, to achieve an adaptive exploration of web applications. WebExplor adopts curiosity-driven reinforcement learning to generate high-quality action sequences (test cases) satisfying temporal logical relations. Besides, WebExplor incrementally builds an automaton during the online testing process, which provides high-level guidance to further improve the testing efficiency. We have conducted comprehensive evaluations of WebExplor on six real-world projects, a commercial SaaS web application, and performed an in-the-wild study of the top 50 web applications in the world. The results demonstrate that in most cases WebExplor can achieve significantly higher failure detection rate, code coverage and efficiency than existing state-of-the-art web testing techniques. WebExplor also detected 12 previously unknown failures in the commercial web application, which have been confirmed and fixed by the developers. Furthermore, our in-the-wild study further uncovered 3,466 exceptions and errors.",

Therefore, intensive research has led to advanced verification solutions ranging from ISS-based reference models, (cross-level) simulation down to formal verification at the RTL. During the verification of the processor implementation at the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level, test stimuli, i.e. test programs are needed. They are either created manually or with the aid of sophisticated test program generators. However, significant effort is required to produce thorough test programs. In this paper, we devise a novel approach for processor verification by Equivalent Program EXecution (EPEX). Our approach is based on a new form of equivalence checking Instead of comparing the architectural states of two models which execute the same program P, we derive a second, but equivalent program P^ from P (wrt. to a formal ISA model), and check that executing P and P^ will produce equal architectural states on the same design. We show that EPEX can easily be used in a simulation-based verification environment and broadens existing tests automatically. In a RISC-V case study using different core configurations of the well-known VexRiscv core, we demonstrate the bug-finding capabilities of EPEX.",

Our approach leverages differential testing to establish a test oracle for ORM-specific bugs. Specifically, we first generate random relational database schemas, set up the respective databases, and then, we query these databases using the APIs of the ORM systems under test. To tackle the challenge that ORMs lack a common input language, we generate queries written in an abstract query language. These abstract queries are translated into concrete, executable ORM queries, which are ultimately used to differentially test the correctness of target implementations. The effectiveness of our method heavily relies on the data inserted to the underlying databases. Therefore, we employ a solver-based approach for producing targeted database records with respect to the constraints of the generated queries. We implement our approach as a tool, called CYNTHIA, which found 28 bugs in five popular ORM systems. The vast majority of these bugs are confirmed (25 / 28), more than half were fixed (20 / 28), and three were marked as release blockers by the corresponding developers.",

Broadly, the operator must keep the actors in frame while safely navigating around obstacles and while fulfilling an artistic vision. We propose a unified hardware and software system that distributes some of the camera operator’s burden, freeing the operator up to focus on safety and aesthetics during a take. Our real-time system provides solo operators with end-to-end control so that they can balance on-set responsiveness to action against planned storyboards and framing while looking where they are going. By default, we film without a field monitor.Our LookOut system is built around a lightweight commodity camera gimbal mechanism, with heavy modifications to the controller, which would normally just provide active stabilization. Our control algorithm reacts to speech commands, video, and a premade script. Specifically, our automatic monitoring of the live video feed saves the operator from distractions. In preproduction, an artist uses our graphical user interface (GUI) to design a sequence of high-level camera “behaviors.” Those can be specific, based on a storyboard, or looser objectives, such as “frame both actors.” Then, during filming, a machine-readable script, exported from the GUI, ties together with the sensor readings to drive the gimbal. To validate our algorithm, we compared tracking strategies, interfaces, and hardware protocols and collected impressions from (a) filmmakers who used all aspects of our system and (b) filmmakers who watched footage filmed using LookOut.",

        "abstract": "The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.",

To support diverse requirements for system software such as accessing low-level hardware, Rust allows programmers to perform operations that are not protected by the Rust compiler with the unsafe keyword. However, Rust's safety guarantee relies on the soundness of all unsafe code in the program as well as the standard and external libraries, making it hard to reason about their correctness. In other words, a single bug in any unsafe code breaks the whole program's safety guarantee. In this paper, we introduce RUDRA, a program that analyzes and reports potential memory safety bugs in unsafe Rust. Since a bug in unsafe code threatens the foundation of Rust's safety guarantee, our primary focus is to scale our analysis to all the packages hosted in the Rust package registry. RUDRA can scan the entire registry (43k packages) in 6.5 hours and identified 264 previously unknown memory safety bugs---leading to 76 CVEs and 112 RustSec advisories being filed, which represent 51.6% of memory safety bugs reported to RustSec since 2016. The new bugs RUDRA found are non-trivial, subtle, and often made by Rust experts: two in the Rust standard library, one in the official futures library, and one in the Rust compiler. RUDRA is open-source, and part of its algorithm is integrated into the official Rust linter.",

However, automated test generation often results in large test suites that are hard to evaluate and investigate manually.This article proposes a taxonomy of the faults we have found using search-based software testing techniques applied on RESTful APIs. The taxonomy is a first step in understanding, analyzing, and ultimately fixing software faults in web services and enterprise applications. We propose to apply a density-based clustering algorithm to the test cases evolved during the search to allow a better separation between different groups of faults. This is needed to enable engineers to highlight and focus on the most serious faults.Tests were automatically generated for a set of eight case studies, seven open-source and one industrial. The test cases generated during the search are clustered based on the reported last executed line and based on the error messages returned, when such error messages were available. The tests were manually evaluated to determine their root causes and to obtain additional information.The article presents a taxonomy of the faults found based on the manual analysis of 415 faults in the eight case studies and proposes a method to support the classification using clustering of the resulting test cases.",

Then, as our main contribution, we establish an atomic puzzle taxonomy that closes the gap between the analog and digital domains.

These differences can be abused by attackers to evade detection or complicate reverse engineering, and are often found by researchers through a manual, trial-and-error process.  In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis and exploration of PE parsers. To this end, we developed a framework to easily capture the details on how different software parses, checks, and validates whether a file is compliant with a set of specifications. We then used this framework to create models for the loaders of three versions of Windows (XP, 7, and 10) and for several reverse-engineering and antivirus tools. Finally, we used this framework to automatically compare different models, generate new samples from a model, or validate an executable according to a chosen model. Our system also supports more complex tasks, such as “generating samples that would load on Windows 10 but not on Windows 7.”  The results of our analysis have consequences on several aspects of system security. We show that popular analysis tools can be completely bypassed, that the information extracted by these analysis tools can be easily manipulated, and that it is trivial for malware authors to fingerprint and “target” only specific versions of an operating system in ways that are not obvious to someone analyzing the executable. But, more importantly, we show that there is not one correct way to parse PE files, and therefore that it is not sufficient for security tools to fix the many inconsistencies we found in our experiments. Instead, to tackle the problem at its roots, tools should allow the analyst to select which of the several loader models they should emulate.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, several quantum software stacks (QSS) have been developed in response to rapid hardware advances in quantum computing. A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity. This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDIFF with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and cross entropy. We evaluate QDiff with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDiff on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDiff's source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.",

We propose HeteroGen that takes C/C++ code as input and automatically generates an HLS version with test behavior preservation and better performance. Key to the success of HeteroGen is adapting the idea of search-based program repair to the heterogeneous computing domain, while addressing two technical challenges. First, the turn-around time of HLS compilation and simulation is much longer than the usual C/C++ compilation and execution time; therefore, HeteroGen applies pattern-oriented program edits guided by common fix patterns and their dependences. Second, behavior and performance checking requires testing, but test cases are often unavailable. Thus, HeteroGen auto-generates test inputs suitable for checking C to HLS-C conversion errors, while providing high branch coverage for the original C code.   An evaluation of HeteroGen shows that it produces an HLS-compatible version for nine out of ten real-world heterogeneous applications fully automatically, applying up to 438 lines of edits to produce an HLS version 1.63x faster than the original version.",

Programming stacks for FPGAs, however, are stuck in the past—they are based on traditional hardware languages, which were appropriate when FPGAs were simple, homogeneous fabrics of basic programmable primitives. We describe Reticle, a new low-level abstraction for FPGA programming that, unlike existing languages, explicitly represents the special-purpose units available on a particular FPGA device. Reticle has two levels: a portable intermediate language and a target-specific assembly language. We show how to use a standard instruction selection approach to lower intermediate programs to assembly programs, which can be both faster and more effective than the complex metaheuristics that existing FPGA toolchains use. We use Reticle to implement linear algebra operators and coroutines and find that Reticle compilation runs up to 100 times faster than current approaches while producing comparable or better run-time and utilization.",

For example, the infamous reentrancy bug in the DAO contract allows attackers to arbitrarily withdraw ethers, which caused millions of dollars loss. Currently, the main countermeasure against contract bugs is to thoroughly detect and verify contracts before deployment, which, however, cannot defend against unknown bugs. These detection methods also suffer from possible false negative results.  In this paper, we propose SolSaviour, a framework for repairing and recovering deployed defective smart contracts by redeploying patched contracts and migrating old contracts’ internal states to the new ones. SolSaviour consists of a voteDestruct mechanism and a TEE cluster. The voteDestruct mechanism allows contract stake holders to decide whether to destroy the defective contract and withdraw inside assets. The TEE cluster is responsible for asset escrow, redeployment of patched contracts, and state migration. Our experiment results show that SolSaviour can successfully repair vulnerabilities, reduce asset losses, and recover all defective contracts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a defending mechanism for repairing and recovering deployed defective smart contracts.",

In particular, we introduce an online system, Tardis, for overcoming deterministic faults by using a blend of program analysis and runtime program data to systematically determine the fault-triggering input events and using domain-specific models to automatically generate transformations of the fault-triggering inputs that are both safe and semantically equivalent. We evaluated Tardison several production network control plane applications (CPAs), including six SDN CPAs and several popular BGP CPAs using 71 realistic bugs.

This symbolic value-flow (“symvalic”) analysis models program behavior with high precision, e.g., full path sensitivity. To achieve deep modeling of program semantics, the analysis relies on a symbiotic relationship between a traditional static analysis fixpoint computation and a symbolic solver: the solver does not merely receive a complex “path condition” to solve, but is instead invoked repeatedly (often tens or hundreds of thousands of times), in close cooperation with the flow computation of the analysis. The result of the symvalic analysis architecture is a static modeling of program behavior that is much more complete than symbolic execution, much more precise than conventional static analysis, and domain-agnostic: no special-purpose definition of anti-patterns is necessary in order to compute violations of safety conditions with high precision. We apply the analysis to the domain of Ethereum smart contracts. This domain represents a fundamental challenge for program analysis approaches: despite numerous publications, research work has not been effective at uncovering vulnerabilities of high real-world value. In systematic comparison of symvalic analysis with past tools, we find significantly increased completeness (shown as 83-96% statement coverage and more true error reports) combined with much higher precision, as measured by rate of true positive reports. In terms of real-world impact, since the beginning of 2021, the analysis has resulted in the discovery and disclosure of several critical vulnerabilities, over funds in the many millions of dollars. Six separate bug bounties totaling over $350K have been awarded for these disclosures.",

        "abstract": "Malware is a major threat to modern computer systems. Malicious behaviors are hidden by a variety of techniques: code obfuscation, message encoding and encryption, etc. Countermeasures have been developed to thwart these techniques in order to expose malicious behaviors. However, these countermeasures rely heavily on identifying specific API calls, which has significant limitations as these calls can be misleading or hidden from the analyst. In this paper, we show that malicious programs share a key component which we call a behavior dispatcher, a code structure which is intercepted between various condition checks and malicious actions. By identifying these behavior dispatchers, a malware analysis can be guided into behavior dispatchers and activate hidden malicious actions more easily. We propose BDHunter, a system that automatically identifies behavior dispatchers to assist triggering malicious behaviors. BDHunter takes advantage of the observation that a dispatcher compares an input with a set of expected values to determine which malicious behaviors to execute next. We evaluate BDHunter on recent malware samples to identify behavior dispatchers and show that these dispatchers can help trigger more malicious behaviors (otherwise hidden). Our experimental results show that BDHunter identifies 77.4% of dispatchers within the top 20 candidates discovered. Furthermore, BDHunter-guided concolic execution successfully triggers 13.0x and 2.6x more malicious behaviors, compared to unguided symbolic and concolic execution, respectively. These demonstrate that BDHunter effectively identifies behavior dispatchers, which are useful for exposing malicious behaviors.",

These discrepancies arise due to the plethora of endhost implementations and evolutions thereof. It is prohibitive to proactively employ a large set of implementations at the NIDS and check incoming packets against all of those. Hence, NIDS typically choose simplified implementations that attempt to approximate and generalize across the different endhost implementations. Unfortunately, this solution is fundamentally flawed since such approximations are bound to have discrepancies with some endhost implementations. In this paper, we develop a lightweight system Themis, which empowers the NIDS in identifying these discrepancies and reactively forking its connection states when any packets with \"ambiguities\" are encountered. Specifically, Themis incorporates an offline phase in which it extracts models from various popular implementations using symbolic execution. During runtime, it maintains a nondeterministic finite automaton to keep track of the states for each possible implementation. Our extensive evaluations show that Themis is extremely effective and can detect all evasion attacks known to date, while consuming extremely low overhead. En route, we also discovered multiple previously unknown discrepancies that can be exploited to bypass current NIDS.",

Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) is useful to trigger complex input conditions and enables an accurate exploration of a program while providing extensive crash replayability and semantic insights.  However, scaling this type of analysis to complex binaries is difficult. Current methods suffer from the path explosion problem, despite many attempts to mitigate this challenge (e.g., by merging paths when appropriate). Still, in general, this challenge is not yet surmounted, and most bugs discovered through such techniques are shallow.  We propose a novel approach to address the path explosion problem: A smart triaging system that leverages supervised machine learning techniques to replicate human expertise, leading to vulnerable path discovery. Our approach monitors the execution traces in vulnerable programs and extracts relevant features—register and memory accesses, function complexity, system calls—to guide the symbolic exploration. We train models to learn the patterns of vulnerable paths from the extracted features, and we leverage their predictions to discover interesting execution paths in new programs.  We implement our approach in a tool called SyML, and we evaluate it on the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) dataset—a well-known dataset of vulnerable programs—and on 3 real-world Linux binaries. We show that the knowledge collected from the analysis of vulnerable paths, without any explicit prior knowledge about vulnerability patterns, is transferrable to unseen binaries, and leads to outperforming prior work in path prioritization by triggering more, and different, unique vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic execution is an essential approach for automated test case generation. However, the approach is generally not scalable to large programs. One critical reason is that the constraint solving problems in symbolic execution are generally hard. Consequently, the symbolic execution process may get stuck in solving such hard problems. To mitigate this issue, symbolic execution tools generally rely on a timeout threshold to terminate the solving. Such a timeout is generally set to a fixed, predefined value, e.g., five minutes in angr. Nevertheless, how to set a proper timeout is critical to the tool’s efficiency. This paper proposes an approach to tackle the problem by predicting the time required for solving a constraint model so that the symbolic execution engine could base on the information to determine whether to continue the current solving process. Due to the cost of the prediction itself, our approach triggers the predictor only when the solving time has exceeded a relatively small value. We have shown that such a predictor can achieve promising performance with several different machine learning models and datasets. By further employing an adaptive design, the predictor can achieve an F1-score ranging from 0.743 to 0.800 on these datasets. We then apply the predictor to eight programs and conduct simulation experiments. Results show that the efficiency of constraint solving for symbolic execution can be improved by 1.25x to 3x, depending on the distribution of the hardness of their constraint models.",

In this paper, we propose ModelDiff, a testing-based approach to deep learning model similarity comparison. Instead of directly comparing the weights, activations, or outputs of two models, we compare their behavioral patterns on the same set of test inputs. Specifically, the behavioral pattern of a model is represented as a decision distance vector (DDV), in which each element is the distance between the model's reactions to a pair of inputs. The knowledge similarity between two models is measured with the cosine similarity between their DDVs. To evaluate ModelDiff, we created a benchmark that contains 144 pairs of models that cover most popular model reuse methods, including transfer learning, model compression, and model stealing. Our method achieved 91.7% correctness on the benchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using ModelDiff for model reuse detection. A study on mobile deep learning apps has shown the feasibility of ModelDiff on real-world models.",

        "abstract": "Differential privacy offers a formal framework for reasoning about the privacy and accuracy of computations on private data. It also offers a rich set of building blocks for constructing private data analyses. When carefully calibrated, these analyses simultaneously guarantee the privacy of the individuals contributing their data, and the accuracy of the data analysis results, inferring useful properties about the population. The compositional nature of differential privacy has motivated the design and implementation of several programming languages to ease the implementation of differentially private analyses. Even though these programming languages provide support for reasoning about privacy, most of them disregard reasoning about the accuracy of data analyses. To overcome this limitation, we present DPella, a programming framework providing data analysts with support for reasoning about privacy, accuracy, and their trade-offs. The distinguishing feature of DPella is a novel component that statically tracks the accuracy of different data analyses. To provide tight accuracy estimations, this component leverages taint analysis for automatically inferring statistical independence of the different noise quantities added for guaranteeing privacy. We evaluate our approach by implementing several classical queries from the literature and showing how data analysts can calibrate the privacy parameters to meet the accuracy requirements, and vice versa.",

        "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners in the fields of testing, security assessment and web development seeking to evaluate a given web application often have to rely on the existence of a model of the respective system, which is then used as input to task-specific tools. Such models may include information on HTTP endpoints and their parameters, available user actions/event listeners and required assets. Unfortunately, this data is often unavailable in practice, as only rigorous development practices or manual analysis guarantee their existence and correctness. Crawlers based on static analysis have traditionally been used to extract required information from existing sites. Regrettably, these tools can not accurately account for the dynamic behavior introduced by technologies such as JavaScript that are prevalent on modern sites. While methods based on dynamic analysis exist, they are often not fully capable of identifying event listeners and their effects. In an earlier work, we presented XIEv, an approach for dynamic analysis of web applications that produces an execution trace usable for the extraction of navigation graphs, identification of bugs at runtime and enumeration of resources. It offers improved recognition and selection of event listeners as well as a greater range of observed effects compared to existing approaches. While the evaluation of our research prototype implementation confirmed the capabilities of XIEv, it was generally out-performed by static crawlers in terms of speed. This work introduces CHIEv, an approach that augments XIEv by enabling concurrent processing as well as incorporating the results of a static crawler in real-time. Our results indicate a significant increase in performance, particularly when applied to larger sites.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic taint analysis (DTA) is a popular program analysis technique with applications to diverse fields such as software vulnerability detection and reverse engineering. It consists of marking sensitive data as tainted and tracking its propagation at runtime. While DTA has been implemented on top of many different analysis platforms, these implementations generally incur significant slowdown from taint propagation. Since a purely dynamic analysis cannot predict which instructions will operate on tainted values at runtime, programs have to be fully instrumented for taint propagation even when they never actually observe tainted values. We propose leveraging speculative optimizations to reduce slowdown on the peak performance of programs instrumented for DTA on a managed runtime capable of dynamic compilation.  In this paper, we investigate how speculative optimizations can reduce the peak performance impact of taint propagation on programs executed on a managed runtime. We also explain how a managed runtime can implement DTA to be amenable to such optimizations. We implemented our ideas in TruffleTaint, a DTA platform which supports both dynamic languages like JavaScript and languages like C and C++ which are typically compiled statically. We evaluated TruffleTaint on several benchmarks from the popular Computer Language Benchmarks Game and SPECint 2017 benchmark suites. Our evaluation shows that TruffleTaint is often able to avoid slowdown entirely when programs do not operate on tainted data, and that it exhibits slowdown of on average ∼2.10x and up to ∼5.52x when they do, which is comparable to state-of-the-art taint analysis platforms optimized for performance.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic execution has been widely applied in detecting vulnerabilities in web applications. Modeling language-specific built-in functions is essential for symbolic execution. Since built-in functions tend to be complicated and are typically implemented in low-level languages, a common strategy is to manually translate them into the SMT-LIB language for constraint solving. Such translation requires an excessive amount of human effort and deep understandings of the function behaviors. Incorrect translation can invalidate the final results. This problem aggravates in PHP applications because of their cross-language nature, i.e., , the built-in functions are written in C, but the rest code is in PHP.  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of automating the process of modeling PHP built-in functions for symbolic execution. We synthesize C programs by transforming the constraint solving task in PHP symbolic execution into a C-compliant format and integrating them with C implementations of the built-in functions. We apply symbolic execution on the synthesized C program to find a feasible path, which gives a solution that can be applied to the original PHP constraints. In this way, we automate the modeling of built-in functions in PHP applications.  We thoroughly compare our automated method with the state-of-the-art manual modeling tool. The evaluation results demonstrate that our automated method is more accurate with a higher function coverage, and can exploit a similar number of vulnerabilities. Our empirical analysis also shows that the manual and automated methods have different strengths, which complement each other in certain scenarios. Therefore, the best practice is to combine both of them to optimize the accuracy, correctness, and coverage of symbolic execution.",

Identifying all possible vulnerabilities in complex designs is very challenging. One of the challenges stems from the lack of visibility into the transient micro-architectural state of the processor. Prior work has used covert channels to identify data leakage from transient state, which limits the systematic discovery of all potential leakage sources. This paper presents INTROSPECTRE, a pre-silicon framework for early discovery of transient execution vulnerabilities. INTROSPECTRE addresses the lack of visibility into the micro-architectural processor state by integrating into the register transfer level (RTL) design flow, gaining full access to the internal state of the processor. Full visibility into the processor state enables INTROSPECTRE to perform a systematic leakage analysis that includes all micro-architectural structures, allowing it to identify potential leakage that may not be reachable with known side channels. We implement INTROSPECTRE on an RTL simulator and use it to perform transient leakage analysis on the RISC-V BOOM processor. We identify multiple transient leakage scenarios, most of which had not been highlighted on this processor design before.",

To address this problem, automated methods can generate synthetic data to fill in gaps for training and test data coverage. We propose an evolution-based technique to assist developers with uncovering limitations in existing data when previously unseen environmental phenomena are introduced. This technique explores unique contexts for a given environmental condition, with an emphasis on diversity. Synthetic data generated by this technique may be used for two purposes: (1) to assess the robustness of a system to uncertain environmental factors and (2) to improve the system’s robustness.

In many applications of such synthesis (e.g., program repair or reverse engineering), we are to reconstruct a program that is close to a specific target program, not merely to produce some program that satisfies the seen examples. In such settings, we wish that the synthesized program generalizes well, i.e., has as few errors as possible on the unobserved examples capturing the target function behavior. In this paper, we propose the first framework (called SynGuar) for PBE synthesizers that guarantees to achieve low generalization error with high probability. Our main contribution is a procedure to dynamically calculate how many additional examples suffice to theoretically guarantee generalization. We show how our techniques can be used in 2 well-known synthesis approaches: PROSE and STUN (synthesis through unification), for common string-manipulation program benchmarks. We find that often a few hundred examples suffice to provably bound generalization error below 5% with high (≥ 98%) probability on these benchmarks. Further, we confirm this empirically: SynGuar significantly improves the accuracy of existing synthesizers in generating the right target programs. But with fewer examples chosen arbitrarily, the same baseline synthesizers (without SynGuar) overfit and lose accuracy.",

In particular, we use the volume of production data to periodically refresh our large corpus of test inputs and expected outputs; we use perturbation of the data to obtain coverage-adequate tests; and we use clustering to help identify patterns of failures that are indicative of software bugs. We demonstrate our methodology on an ML-based context-aware Speller. Our coverage-adequate, approx. 1 million regression test cases, automatically authored and maintained for Speller (1) are virtually maintenance free, (2) detect a higher number of Speller failures than previous manually-curated tests, (3) have better coverage of previously unknown functional boundaries of the ML component, and (4) lend themselves to automatic failure triaging by clustering and prioritizing subcategories of tests with over-represented failures. We identify several systematic failure patterns which were due to previously undetected bugs in the Speller, e.g., (1) when the user misses the first letter in a short word, and (2) when the user mistakenly inserts a character in the last token of an address; these have since been fixed.",

Without a rigorous process, people may approach assessment in ad hoc ways—leading to the possibility of wide variations in assessment of the same agent due only to variations in their processes. AAR, or After-Action Review, is a method some military organizations use to assess human agents, and it has been validated in many domains. Drawing upon this strategy, we derived an After-Action Review for AI (AAR/AI), to organize ways people assess reinforcement learning agents in a sequential decision-making environment. We then investigated what AAR/AI brought to human assessors in two qualitative studies. The first investigated AAR/AI to gather formative information, and the second built upon the results, and also varied the type of explanation (model-free vs. model-based) used in the AAR/AI process. Among the results were the following: (1) participants reporting that AAR/AI helped to organize their thoughts and think logically about the agent, (2) AAR/AI encouraged participants to reason about the agent from a wide range of perspectives, and (3) participants were able to leverage AAR/AI with the model-based explanations to falsify the agent’s predictions.",

        "abstract": "Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information from non-functional characteristics. Prior side-channel detection work is able to identify numerous potential vulnerabilities. However, in practice, many such vulnerabilities leak a negligible amount of sensitive information, and thus developers are often reluctant to address them. Existing tools do not provide information to evaluate a leak's severity, such as the number of leaked bits. To address this issue, we propose a new program analysis method to precisely quantify the leaked information in a single-trace attack through side-channels. It can identify covert information flows in programs that expose confidential information and can reason about security flaws that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, for a developer to find. We model an attacker's observation of each leakage site as a constraint. We use symbolic execution to generate these constraints and then run Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the number of leaked bits for each leakage site. By applying the Central Limit Theorem, we provide an error bound for these estimations. We have implemented the technique in a tool called Abacus, which not only finds very fine-grained side-channel vulnerabilities but also estimates how many bits are leaked. Abacus outperforms existing dynamic side-channel detection tools in performance and accuracy. We evaluate Abacus on OpenSSL, mbedTLS, Libgcrypt, and Monocypher. Our results demonstrate that most reported vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in practice and should be de-prioritized by developers. We also find several sensitive vulnerabilities that are missed by the existing tools. We confirm those vulnerabilities with manual checks and by contacting the developers.",

Many RNN-driven dialogue systems, such as Siri, Google Home, and Alexa, have been deployed to assist various tasks. However, accompanying this outstanding performance, RNN-driven dialogue systems, which are essentially a kind of software, could also produce erroneous behaviors and result in massive losses. Meanwhile, the complexity and intractability of RNN models that power the dialogue systems make their testing challenging. In this paper, we design and implement DialTest, the first RNN-driven dialogue system testing tool. DialTest employs a series of transformation operators to make realistic changes on seed data while preserving their oracle information properly. To improve the efficiency of detecting faults, DialTest further adopts Gini impurity to guide the test generation process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate DialTest. We first experiment it on two fundamental tasks, i.e., intent detection and slot filling, of natural language understanding. The experiment results show that DialTest can effectively detect hundreds of erroneous behaviors for different RNN-driven natural language understanding (NLU) modules of dialogue systems and improve their accuracy via retraining with the generated data. Further, we conduct a case study on an industrial dialogue system to investigate the performance of DialTest under the real usage scenario. The study shows DialTest can detect errors and improve the robustness of RNN-driven dialogue systems effectively.",

While several mechanisms to detect such errors have been previously proposed, they suffer from a variety of drawbacks, including poor performance, imprecise or probabilistic detection of errors, or requiring invasive changes to the ISA, binary-layout, or source-code that results in compatibility issues. As a result, memory-safety errors continue to be hard to detect and a principal cause of security problems.In this work, we present a minimally invasive and low-cost hardware-based memory-safety checking framework for detecting out-of-bounds accesses and use-after-free errors. The key idea of our mechanism is to re-purpose some of the “unused bits” in a pointer in 64-bit architectures to store an index into a bounds information table that can be used to catch out-bounds errors and use-after-free errors without any change to the binary layout. Using this memory-safety checking framework, we enable HeapCheck, a design for detecting Out-of-bounds and Use-after-free accesses for heap-objects, that are responsible for the majority of memory-safety errors in the wild. Our evaluations using C/C++ SPEC CPU 2017 workloads on Gem5 show that our solution incurs 1.5% slowdown on average, using an 8 KB on-chip SRAM cache for caching bounds-information. Our mechanism allows detection of out-of-bounds errors in user-code as well as in unmodified shared-library functions. Our mechanism has detected out-of-bounds accesses in 87 lines of code in the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks, primarily in Glibc v2.27 functions, that, to our knowledge, have not been previously detected even with popular tools like Address Sanitizer.",

With E-IoT, users have a complete control of audio, video, scheduled events, lightning fixtures, shades, door access, and relays via available user interfaces. As such, these systems see widespread use in government or smart private offices, schools, smart buildings, professional conference rooms, hotels, smart homes, yachts, and similar professional settings. However, even with their widespread use, the security of many E-IoT systems has not been researched in the literature. Further, many E-IoT systems utilize proprietary communication protocols that rely mostly on security through obscurity, which has perhaps led many users to mistakenly assume that these systems are secure. To address this open research problem and determine if E-IoT systems are vulnerable, we focus on one of the core E-IoT components, E-IoT communication buses. Communication buses are used by E-IoT proprietary protocols to connect multiple E-IoT devices (e.g., keypads and touchscreens) and trigger pre-configured events upon user actions. In this study, we introduce LightningStrike, the implementation of four proof-of-concept attacks that demonstrate several weaknesses in E-IoT proprietary communication protocols through communication buses. With LightningStrike, we show that it is feasible for an attacker to compromise E-IoT systems using E-IoT communication buses. We demonstrate that popular E-IoT proprietary communication protocols are susceptible to Denial-of-Service, eavesdropping, impersonation, and replay attacks. As E-IoT systems control physical access, safety components, and emergency equipment, an attacker with a low level of knowledge and effort can easily exploit E-IoT vulnerabilities to impact the security and safety of users, smart systems, and smart buildings worldwide.",

However, it can be quite challenging to introduce and fully leverage security tools without affecting the speed or frequency of deployments in the DevOps paradigm. Aims: We aim to empirically investigate the key challenges practitioners face when integrating security tools into a DevOps workflow in order to provide recommendations for overcoming the challenges. Method: We conducted a study involving 31 systematically selected webinars on integrating security tools in DevOps. We used a qualitative data analysis method, i.e., thematic analysis, to identify the challenges and emerging solutions related to integrating security tools in rapid deployment environments. Results: We find that whilst traditional security tools are unable to cater for the needs of DevOps, the industry is moving towards new generations of security tools that have started focusing on the needs of DevOps. We have developed a DevOps workflow that integrates security tools and a set of guidelines by synthesizing practitioners' recommendations in the analyzed webinars. Conclusion: Whilst the latest security tools are addressing some of the requirements of DevOps, there are many tool-related drawbacks yet to be adequately addressed.",

        "abstract": "The P4 software ecosystem to operate programmable data planes is increasingly becoming complex. The packet-processing behavior is defined by several components: the P4 program, the compiler that maps P4 programs to resource-constrained switch pipeline, the control-plane program that installs rules, and the switch software agents that configure the data plane. Bugs in any one or more of these components would potentially introduce packet-processing errors in the data plane. Prior work verifies P4 programs before deployment and found many program bugs. But bugs can happen in other components after the program deployment and may not be found during testing and only manifest themselves in production. In this work, our goal is to detect packet-processing errors induced by bugs that are not caught (or are difficult to catch) before the P4 program deployment. Our key idea is to let P4 programmers specify the intended packet-processing behavior and validate the actual packet-processing behavior against the intended behavior at runtime. We obtain intended behavior from the P4 programmers in the form of assertions, where each assertion specifies which tables and actions should be applied and in what order on a certain subset of traffic. Next, the assertions are compiled and translated to P4 implementation such that the implementation efficiently tracks the packet execution path, that is, the set of tables applied and actions executed, and then validates the tracked behavior at line rate. We show that our techniques can be used to effectively detect bugs that are difficult, if not impossible, to catch with existing techniques for testing and verifying programmable data planes.",

However, exploring hybrid test generation programs, to obtain test inputs, is both computationally demanding and challenging to parallelize. We present the first programming and execution models, dubbed Tempo, for parallel exploration of hybrid test generation programs. We describe two different strategies for mapping the computation to parallel hardware and implement them both for GPUs and CPUs. We evaluated Tempo by generating instances of various data structures commonly used for benchmarking in the BET domain.

We develop P4wn, a program profiler that can analyze program behaviors of stateful data plane systems; it captures the fact that these systems process packets differently based on program state, which in turn depends on the underlying stochastic traffic pattern. Whereas existing profilers can only analyze stateless network processing, P4wn can analyze stateful processing behaviors and their respective probabilities. Although program profilers have general applications, we showcase a concrete use case in detail: adversarial testing. Unlike regular program testing, adversarial testing distinguishes and specifically stresses low-probability edge cases in a program. Our evaluation shows that P4wn can analyze complex programs that existing tools cannot handle, and that it can effectively identify edge-case traces.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting a program requires a security analyst to manipulate data in program memory with the goal to obtain control over the program counter and to escalate privileges. However, this is a tedious and lengthy process as: (1) the analyst has to massage program data such that a logical reliable data passing chain can be established, and (2) depending on the attacker goal certain in-place fine-grained protection mechanisms need to be bypassed. Previous work has proposed various techniques to facilitate exploit development. Unfortunately, none of them can be easily used to address the given challenges. This is due to the fact that data in memory is difficult to be massaged by an analyst who does not know the peculiarities of the program as the attack specification is most of the time only textually available, and not automated at all. In this paper, we present indirect transfer oriented programming (iTOP), a framework to automate the construction of control-flow hijacking attacks in the presence of strong protections including control flow integrity, data execution prevention, and stack canaries. Given a vulnerable program, iTOP automatically builds an exploit payload with a chain of viable gadgets with solved SMT-based memory constraints. One salient feature of iTOP is that it contains 13 attack primitives powered by a Turing complete payload specification language, ESL. It also combines virtual and non-virtual gadgets using COOP-like dispatchers. As such, when searching for gadget chains, iTOP can respect, for example, a previously enforced CFI policy, by using only legitimate control flow transfers. We have evaluated iTOP with a variety of programs and demonstrated that it can successfully generate exploits with the developed attack primitives.",

        "abstract": "Missing a security operation such as a bound check has been a major cause of security-critical bugs. Automatically checking whether the code misses a security operation in large programs is challenging since it has to understand whether the security operation is indeed necessary in the context. Recent methods typically employ cross-checking to identify deviations as security bugs, which collects functionally similar program slices and infers missed security operations through majority-voting. An inherent limitation of such approaches is that they heavily rely on a substantial number of similar code pieces to enable cross-checking. In practice, many code pieces are unique, and thus we may be unable to find adequate similar code snippets to utilize cross-checking. In this paper, we present IPPO (Inconsistent Path Pairs as a bug Oracle), a static analysis framework for detecting security bugs based on differential checking. IPPO defines several novel rules to identify code paths that share similar semantics with respect to an object, and collects them as similar-path pairs. It then investigates the path pairs for identifying inconsistent security operations with respect to the object. If one path in a path pair enforces a security operation while the other does not, IPPO reports it as a potential security bug. By utilizing on object-based path-similarity analysis, IPPO achieves a higher precision, compared to conventional code-similarity analysis methods. Through differential checking of a similar-path pair, IPPO eliminates the requirement of constructing a large number of similar code pieces, addressing the limitation of traditional cross-checking approaches. We implemented IPPO and extensively evaluated it on four widely used open-source programs: Linux kernel, OpenSSL library, FreeBSD kernel, and PHP. IPPO found 154, 5, 1, and 1 new security bugs in the above systems, respectively. We have submitted patches for all these bugs, and 136 of them have been accepted by corresponding maintainers. The results confirm the effectiveness and usefulness of IPPO in practice.",

Unfortunately, writing constant-time code by hand is hard, as evidenced by the many flaws discovered in production side channel-resistant code. Prior efforts to automatically transform programs into constant-time equivalents offer limited security or compatibility guarantees, hindering their applicability to real-world software. In this paper, we present Constantine, a compiler-based system to automatically harden programs against microarchitectural side channels. Constantine pursues a radical design point where secret-dependent control and data flows are completely linearized (i.e., all involved code/data accesses are always executed). This strategy provides strong security and compatibility guarantees by construction, but its natural implementation leads to state explosion in real-world programs. To address this challenge, Constantine relies on carefully designed optimizations such as just-in-time loop linearization and aggressive function cloning for fully context-sensitive points-to analysis, which not only address state explosion, but also lead to an efficient and compatible solution. Constantine yields overheads as low as 16% on standard benchmarks and can handle a fully-fledged component from the production wolfSSL library.",

Typically, such polling is performed by a dedicated core. Compiler Interrupts (CIs) instead enable efficient, automatic high-rate polling on a shared thread, which performs other work between polls. CIs are instrumentation-based and light-weight, allowing frequent interrupts with little performance impact. For example, when targeting a 5,000 cycle interval, the median overhead of our fastest CI design is 4% vs. 800% for hardware interrupts, across programs in the SPLASH-2, Phoenix and Parsec benchmark suites running with 32 threads. We evaluate CIs on three systems-level applications: (a) kernel bypass networking with mTCP, (b) joint kernel bypass networking and CPU scheduling with Shenango, and (c) delegation, a message-passing alternative to locking, with FFWD. For each application, we find that CIs offer compelling qualitative and quantitative improvements over the current state of the art.

Conversely, formal model checking can explore vast state spaces efficiently, increasing confidence in the file system's implementation. Yet model checking is not currently part of file system development. Our position is that file systems should be designed a priori to facilitate model checking. To this end, we introduce MCFS, an architecture for efficient and comprehensive file-system model checking. MCFS relies on two new APIs that save and restore a file system's in-memory and on-disk state. We describe our earlier attempts at model-checking file systems, including unsuccessful or inefficient ones. Those attempts led us to develop VeriFS, which implements the new APIs. We illustrate MCFS's model-checking principles with VeriFS, a FUSE-based file system we were able to quickly develop with MCFS's help.",

These steps may result in unintended or malicious voice data leaks and in unauthorized actions, such as a purchase. This paper presents MegaMind, a novel extensible platform that lets a user deploy security and privacy extensions locally on their voice assistant. MegaMind's extensions interpose on requests before sending them to the cloud and on responses before delivering them to the user. MegaMind's programming model enables writing powerful extensions with ease, such as one for secure conversations. Additionally, MegaMind protects against malicious extensions by providing two important guarantees, namely permission enforcement and non-interference.

        "abstract": "Search-based software testing (SBST) generates tests using search algorithms guided by measurements gauging how far a test case is away from exercising a coverage goal. The effectiveness of SBST largely depends on the continuity and monotonicity of the fitness landscape decided by these measurements and the search operators. Unfortunately, the fitness landscape is challenging when the function under test takes object inputs, as classical measurement hardly provide guidance for constructing legitimate object inputs. To overcome this problem, we propose test seeds, i.e., test code skeletons of legitimate objects which enable the use of classical measurements. Given a target branch in a function under test, we first statically analyze the function to build an object construction graph that captures the relation between the operands of the target method and the states of their relevant object inputs. Based on the graph, we synthesize test template code where each \"slot\" is a mutation point for the search algorithm. This approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing SBST algorithms, and we implemented EvoObj on top of EvoSuite. Our experiments show that EvoObj outperforms EvoSuite with statistical significance on 2750 methods over 103 open source Java projects using state-of-the-art SBST algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic taint tracking, a technique that traces relationships between values as a program executes, has been used to support a variety of software engineering tasks. Some taint tracking systems only consider data flows and ignore control flows. As a result, relationships between some values are not reflected by the analysis. Many applications of taint tracking either benefit from or rely on these relationships being traced, but past works have found that tracking control flows resulted in over-tainting, dramatically reducing the precision of the taint tracking system. In this article, we introduce Conflux, alternative semantics for propagating taint tags along control flows. Conflux aims to reduce over-tainting by decreasing the scope of control flows and providing a heuristic for reducing loop-related over-tainting. We created a Java implementation of Conflux and performed a case study exploring the effect of Conflux on a concrete application of taint tracking, automated debugging. In addition to this case study, we evaluated Conflux’s accuracy using a novel benchmark consisting of popular, real-world programs. We compared Conflux against existing taint propagation policies, including a state-of-the-art approach for reducing control-flow-related over-tainting, finding that Conflux had the highest F1 score on 43 out of the 48 total tests.",

        "abstract": "Modern programming follows the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) approach rather than the traditional waterfall model. Even the development of modern programming languages uses the CI/CD approach to swiftly provide new language features and to adapt to new development environments. Unlike in the conventional approach, in the modern CI/CD approach, a language specification is no more the oracle of the language semantics because both the specification and its implementations (interpreters or compilers) can co-evolve. In this setting, both the specification and implementations may have bugs, and guaranteeing their correctness is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a novel N+1-version differential testing to resolve the problem. Unlike the traditional differential testing, our approach consists of three steps: 1) to automatically synthesize programs guided by the syntax and semantics from a given language specification, 2) to generate conformance tests by injecting assertions to the synthesized programs to check their final program states, 3) to detect bugs in the specification and implementations via executing the conformance tests on multiple implementations, and 4) to localize bugs on the specification using statistical information. We actualize our approach for the JavaScript programming language via JEST, which performs N+1-version differential testing for modern JavaScript engines and ECMAScript, the language specification describing the syntax and semantics of JavaScript in a natural language. We evaluated JEST with four JavaScript engines that support all modern JavaScript language features and the latest version of ECMAScript (ES11, 2020). JEST automatically synthesized 1,700 programs that covered 97.78% of syntax and 87.70% of semantics from ES11. Using the assertion-injected JavaScript programs, it detected 44 engine bugs in four different engines and 27 specification bugs in ES11.",

        "abstract": "Safe system programming is often a crucial requirement due to its critical role in system software engineering. Conventional low-level programming languages such as C and assembly are efficient, but their inherent unsafe nature makes it undesirable for security-critical scenarios. Recently, Rust has become a promising alternative for safe system-level programming. While giving programmers fine-grained hardware control, its strong type system enforces many security properties including memory safety. However, Rust's security guarantee is not a silver bullet. Runtime crashes and memory-safety errors still harass Rust developers, causing damaging exploitable vulnerabilities, as reported by numerous studies. In this paper, we present and evaluate MirChecker, a fully automated bug detection framework for Rust programs by performing static analysis on Rust's Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR). Based on the observation of existing bugs found in Rust codebases, our approach keeps track of both numerical and symbolic information, detects potential runtime crashes and memory-safety errors by using constraint solving techniques, and outputs informative diagnostics to users. We evaluate MirChecker on both buggy code snippets extracted from existing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and real-world Rust codebases. Our experiments show that MirChecker can detect all the issues in our code snippets, and is capable of performing bug finding in real-world scenarios, where it detected a total of 33 previously unknown bugs including 16 memory-safety issues from 12 Rust packages (crates) with an acceptable false-positive rate.",

        "abstract": "Kernel concurrency bugs are challenging to find because they depend on very specific thread interleavings and test inputs. While separately exploring kernel thread interleavings or test inputs has been closely examined, jointly exploring interleavings and test inputs has received little attention, in part due to the resulting vast search space. Using precious, limited testing resources to explore this search space and execute just the right concurrent tests in the proper order is critical. This paper proposes Snowboard a testing framework that generates and executes concurrent tests by intelligently exploring thread interleavings and test inputs jointly. The design of Snowboard is based on a concept called potential memory communication (PMC), a guess about pairs of tests that, when executed concurrently, are likely to perform memory accesses to shared addresses, which in turn may trigger concurrency bugs. To identify PMCs, Snowboard runs tests sequentially from a fixed initial kernel state, collecting their memory accesses. It then pairs up tests that write and read the same region into candidate concurrent tests. It executes those tests using the associated PMC as a scheduling hint to focus interleaving search only on those schedules that directly affect the relevant memory accesses. By clustering candidate tests on various features of their PMCs, Snowboard avoids testing similar behaviors, which would be inefficient. Finally, by executing tests from small clusters first, it prioritizes uncommon suspicious behaviors that may have received less scrutiny. Snowboard discovered 14 new concurrency bugs in Linux kernels 5.3.10 and 5.12-rc3, of which 12 have been confirmed by developers. Six of these bugs cause kernel panics and filesystem errors, and at least two have existed in the kernel for many years, showing that this approach can uncover hard-to-find, critical bugs. Furthermore, we show that covering as many distinct pairs of uncommon read/write instructions as possible is the test-prioritization strategy with the highest bug yield for a given test-time budget.",

Recently, several methods have been proposed for explaining models of machine learning. However, it is unclear whether these methods are suitable for GNNs and support the task of vulnerability discovery. In this paper we present a framework for evaluating explanation methods on GNNs. We develop a set of criteria for comparing graph explanations and linking them to properties of source code. Based on these criteria, we conduct an experimental study of nine regular and three graph-specific explanation methods. Our study demonstrates that explaining GNNs is a non-trivial task and all evaluation criteria play a role in assessing their efficacy. We further show that graph-specific explanations relate better to code semantics and provide more information to a security expert than regular methods.",

We implement MRT in a testing framework called Revizor, and showcase its effectiveness on real Intel x86 CPUs.

Hence, there is a constant race for defenders to find and patch them before attackers are able to exploit them. Measuring different aspects of this process is important in order to better understand it and improve the odds for defenders. (Aims) The human factor of the vulnerability discovery and patching process has received limited attention. Better knowledge of the characteristics of the people and organizations who discover and report security vulnerabilities can considerably enhance our understanding of the process, provide insights regarding the expended effort in vulnerability hunting, contribute to better security metrics, and help guide practical decisions regarding the strategy of projects to attract vulnerability researchers. (Method) In this paper, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale empirical study on the people and organizations who report vulnerabilities in popular FLOSS projects. Collecting data from a multitude of publicly available sources (NVD, bug-tracking platforms, vendor advisories, source code repositories), we create a dataset of reporter information for 2193 unique reporting entities of 4756 CVEs affecting the Mozilla suite, Apache httpd, the PHP interpreter, and the Linux kernel. We use the dataset to investigate several aspects of the vulnerability discovery process, specifically regarding the distribution of contributions, their temporal characteristics, and the motivations of reporters. (Results) Among our results: around 80% of reports come from 20% of reporters; first time reporters are significant contributors to the yearly total in all 4 projects; productive reporters are specialized w.r.t. the project and vulnerability types; around half of all reports come from reporters acknowledging an affiliation. (Conclusions) Projects depend both on a core of dedicated and productive reporters, and on small contributions from a large number of community reporters. The generalized Pareto principle (the (1 - p)/p law) can be used as a metric for the concentration of contributions in the vulnerability-reporting ecosystem of a project.",

        "abstract": "JavaScript is one of the mainstream programming languages for client-side programming, server-side programming, and even embedded systems. Various JavaScript engines developed and maintained in diverse fields must conform to the syntax and semantics described in ECMAScript, the standard specification of JavaScript. Since an incorrect description in ECMAScript can lead to wrong JavaScript engine implementations, checking the correctness of ECMAScript is critical and essential. However, all the specification updates are currently manually reviewed by the Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39) without any automated tools. Moreover, in late 2014, the committee announced the yearly release cadence and open development process of ECMAScript to quickly adapt to evolving development environments. Because of such frequent updates, checking the correctness of ECMAScript becomes more labor-intensive and error-prone. To alleviate the problem, we propose JSTAR, a JavaScript Specification Type Analyzer using Refinement. It is the first tool that performs type analysis on JavaScript specifications and detects specification bugs using a bug detector. For a given specification, JSTAR first compiles each abstract algorithm written in a structured natural language to a corresponding function in IRES, an untyped intermediate representation for ECMAScript. Then, it performs type analysis for compiled functions with specification types defined in ECMAScript. Based on the result of type analysis, JSTAR detects specification bugs using a bug detector consisting of four checkers. To increase the precision of the type analysis, we present condition-based refinement for type analysis, which prunes out infeasible abstract states using conditions of assertions and branches. We evaluated JSTAR with all 864 versions in the official ECMAScript repository for the recent three years from 2018 to 2021. JSTAR took 137.3 seconds on average to perform type analysis for each version, and detected 157 type-related specification bugs with 59.2% precision; 93 out of 157 bugs are true bugs. Among them, 14 bugs are newly detected by JSTAR, and the committee confirmed them all.",

In addition, noisy qubits require repeatedly performed quantum experiments, which explicitly operate low-level configurations, such as pulses and timing of operations. This requirement is beyond the scope or capability of most existing QPLs.We summarize three execution models to depict the quantum-classical interaction of existing QPLs. Based on the refined HQCC model, we propose the Quingo framework to integrate and manage quantum-classical software and hardware to provide the programmability over HQCC applications and map them to NISQ hardware. We propose a six-phase quantum program life-cycle model matching the refined HQCC model, which is implemented by a runtime system. We also propose the Quingo programming language, an external domain-specific language highlighting timer-based timing control and opaque operation definition, which can be used to describe quantum experiments. We believe the Quingo framework could contribute to the clarification of key techniques in the design of future HQCC systems.",

We first characterize privacy violations that may arise with the integration of heterogeneous systems and services. Based on this knowledge, we propose Taifu, a dynamic testing approach to identify privacy weaknesses from the TAIP. The key insight of Taifu is that the applets which actually program the trigger-action rules can be used as test cases to explore the behavior of the TAIP. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it on the TAIPs that are built around the IFTTT platform. To our great surprise, we find that privacy violations are prevalent among them. Using the automatically generated 407 applets, each from a different TAIP, Taifu detects 194 cases with access policy breaches, 218 access control missing, 90 access revocation missing, 15 unintended flows, and 73 over-privilege access.",

We propose an integrated approach for detecting and discarding overfitting patches via systematic co-exploration of the patch space and input space. We leverage concolic path exploration to systematically traverse the input space (and generate inputs), while ruling out significant parts of the patch space. Given a long enough time budget, this approach allows a significant reduction in the pool of patch candidates, as shown by our experiments. We implemented our technique in the form of a tool called 'CPR' and evaluated its efficacy in reducing the patch space by discarding overfitting patches from a pool of plausible patches. We evaluated our approach for fixing real-world software vulnerabilities and defects, for fixing functionality errors in programs drawn from SV-COMP benchmarks used in software verification, as well as for test-suite guided repair. In our experiments, we observed a patch space reduction due to our concolic exploration of up to 74% for fixing software vulnerabilities and up to 63% for SV-COMP programs.

        "abstract": "Binder, the main mechanism for Android applications to access system services, adopts a client-server role model in its design, assuming the system service as the server and the application as the client. However, a growing number of scenarios require the system service to act as a Binder client and to send queries to a Binder server possibly instantiated by the application. Departing from this role-reversal possibility, this paper proposes the Binder Transaction Redirection (BiTRe) attacks, where the attacker induces the system service to transact with a customized Binder server and then attacks from the Binder server---an often unprotected direction. We demonstrate the scale of the attack surface by enumerating the utilizable Binder interfaces in BiTRe, and discover that the attack surface grows with the Android release version. In Android 11, more than 70% of the Binder interfaces are affected by or can be utilized in BiTRe. We prove the attacks' feasibility by (1) constructing a prototype system that can automatically generate executable programs to reach a substantial part of the attack surface, and (2) identifying a series of vulnerabilities, which are acknowledged by Google and assigned ten CVEs.",

Its effectiveness strongly depends on the guidance of the fitness function. Unfortunately, a common issue in SBST is the so-called flag problem, where the fitness landscape presents a plateau that provides no guidance to the search. In this article, we provide a series of novel testability transformations aimed at providing guidance in the context of commonly used API calls (e.g., strings that need to be converted into valid date/time objects). We also provide specific transformations aimed at helping the testing of REST Web Services. We implemented our novel techniques as an extension to EvoMaster, an SBST tool that generates system-level test cases. Experiments on nine open-source REST web services, as well as an industrial web service, show that our novel techniques improve performance significantly.",

        "abstract": "Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) in Natural Language Processing has seen great progress recently. But almost all the current MRC software is validated with a reference-based method, which requires well-annotated labels for test cases and tests the software by checking the consistency between the labels and the outputs. However, labeling test cases of MRC could be very costly due to their complexity, which makes reference-based validation hard to be extensible and sufficient. Furthermore, solely checking the consistency and measuring the overall score may not be sensible and flexible for assessing the language understanding capability. In this paper, we propose a property-based validation method for MRC software with Metamorphic Testing to supplement the reference-based validation. It does not refer to the labels and hence can make much data available for testing. Besides, it validates MRC software against various linguistic properties to give a specific and in-depth picture on linguistic capabilities of MRC software. Comprehensive experimental results show that our method can successfully reveal violations to the target linguistic properties without the labels. Moreover, it can reveal problems that have been concealed by the traditional validation. Comparison according to the properties provides deeper and more concrete ideas about different language understanding capabilities of the MRC software.",

Our Fall 2021 upper-division entering student cohort is 70% female and 80% people of color. Our new computer science program builds on our strong and internationally recognized track record in applying project-based learning (PBL) in engineering. We believe our PBL CS program to be the first program of its type in North America. Key components of the program are: project-based learning across multiple courses in the upper-division, project-based learning within lower-division courses, straightforward articulation with regional and national community colleges that are minority serving institutions (MSIs), industry and research connections that drive projects, and vertical integration of teams across upper-division semesters. Core to this is a commitment to addressing access and equity issues. The foundation for the new upper-division program is a revamped lower-division core curriculum that also feeds into the information technology and information systems majors offered at our school. The core curriculum is designed to reduce barriers to a degree in computing while encouraging more students to explore a degree in the math-intensive computer science program.

Many CCAI testing problems can be solved by exploring the numerical state space of CCAIs, which is defined by a group of numerical (and nonnumerical) state variables of the CCAIs. However, the current practices for automated numerical state space exploration are either limited by the approximate abstract CCAI models or inefficient due to the large space of network environment parameters and the complicated relation between the CCAI states and network environment parameters. In this paper, we propose an automated numerical state space exploration method, called ACT, which leverages the model-agnostic feature of random testing and greatly improves its efficiency by guiding random testing under the feedback iteratively obtained in a test. Our experiments on five representative Linux TCP CCAIs show that ACT can more efficiently explore a large numerical state space than manual testing, undirected random testing, and symbolic execution based testing, while without requiring an abstract CCAI model. ACT detects multiple design and implementation bugs of these Linux TCP CCAIs, including some new bugs not reported before.",

Reusing tests of attack vectors to industrialize testing them on multiple SUTs mandates an abstraction mechanism to port an attack from one system to another.

As a result, novel data plane verification solutions have been proposed that use formal methods to ensure that network policies are adhered to and that the data plane is free of bugs. While the number of these verification solutions continues to grow, only a few are equipped to verify the data plane when a malicious adversary is present. As research continues to expand the remit of data plane functionality, these solutions may become key to securing an increasingly valuable attack target. In this survey, we review the work that has been dedicated to preventing and detecting attacks on data planes in software-defined networks and discuss some of the unsolved problems in this field that must be addressed in future adversarial verification solutions.",

Unlike prior noncompliance checking approaches which rely on property-guided testing, DIKEUE adopts a property-agnostic, differential testing approach, which leverages the existence of many different control-plane protocol implementations in COTS UEs. DIKEUE uses deviant behavior observed during differential analysis of pairwise COTS UEs as a proxy for identifying noncompliance instances. For deviant behavior identification, DIKEUE first uses black-box automata learning, specialized for 4G LTE control-plane protocols, to extract input-output finite state machine (FSM) for a given UE. It then reduces the identification of deviant behavior in two extracted FSMs as a model checking problem. We applied DIKEUE in checking noncompliance in 14 COTS UEs from 5 vendors and identified 15 new deviant behavior as well as 2 previous implementation issues. Among them, 11 are exploitable whereas 3 can cause potential interoperability issues.",

        "abstract": "Since the emergence of Ethereum, blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps) have become increasingly popular and important. To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework, ÐArcher, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have evaluated ÐArcher on 11 popular real-world DApps. ÐArcher achieves high precision (99.3%), recall (87.6%), and accuracy (89.4%) in bug detection and significantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs in the 11 DApps. So far, six of the 15 bugs have been confirmed by the developers, and three have been fixed. These promising results demonstrate the usefulness of ÐArcher.",

        "abstract": "Unit testing focuses on verifying the functions of individual units of a software system. It is challenging due to the high inter-dependencies among software units. Developers address this by mocking-replacing the dependency by a \"faked\" object. Despite the existence of powerful, dedicated mocking frameworks, developers often turn to a \"hand-rolled\" approach-inheritance. That is, they create a subclass of the dependent class and mock its behavior through method overriding. However, this requires tedious implementation and compromises the design quality of unit tests. This work contributes a fully automated refactoring framework to identify and replace the usage of inheritance by using Mockito-a well received mocking framework. Our approach is built upon the empirical experience from five open source projects that use inheritance for mocking. We evaluate our approach on four other projects. Results show that our framework is efficient, generally applicable to new datasets, mostly preserves test case behaviors in detecting defects (in the form of mutants), and decouples test code from production code. The qualitative evaluation by experienced developers suggests that the auto-refactoring solutions generated by our framework improve the quality of the unit test cases in various aspects, such as making test conditions more explicit, as well as improved cohesion, readability, understandability, and maintainability with test cases.",

Motivated by this, we propose a multi-objective search-based approach (employing NSGA-II) to find minimum changes to the configuration of a set of configurable parameters of a vehicle design, such that the collision probability is maximized, consequently leading to a reversal change in its safety. We conducted experiments, in a vehicle driving simulator, to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach with NSGA-II significantly outperforms the random search. Moreover, based on the detailed analyses of the results, we identify some parameters for which minor changes to their values lead the vehicle into collisions, and demonstrated the importance of studying the configuration of multiple parameters in a single search and the impact of their interactions on causing collisions.",

        "abstract": "Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers have been widely applied in automated software analysis to reason about the queries that encode the essence of program semantics, relieving the heavy burden of manual analysis. Many SMT solving techniques rely on solving Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), which is an NP-complete problem, so they use heuristic search strategies to seek possible solutions, especially when no known theorem can efficiently reduce the problem. An emerging challenge, named Mixed-Bitwise-Arithmetic (MBA) obfuscation, impedes SMT solving by constructing identity equations with both bitwise operations (and, or, negate) and arithmetic computation (add, minus, multiply). Common math theorems for bitwise or arithmetic computation are inapplicable to simplifying MBA equations, leading to performance bottlenecks in SMT solving.   In this paper, we first scrutinize solvers' performance on solving different categories of MBA expressions: linear, polynomial, and non-polynomial. We observe that solvers can handle simple linear MBA expressions, but facing a severe performance slowdown when solving complex linear and non-linear MBA expressions. The root cause is that complex MBA expressions break the reduction laws for pure arithmetic or bitwise computation. To boost solvers' performance, we propose a semantic-preserving transformation to reduce the mixing degree of bitwise and arithmetic operations. We first calculate a signature vector based on the truth table extracted from an MBA expression, which captures the complete MBA semantics. Next, we generate a simpler MBA expression from the signature vector. Our large-scale evaluation on 3000 complex MBA equations shows that our technique significantly boost modern SMT solvers' performance on solving MBA formulas.",

However, as Rust consists of an unsafe language subset unsafe, Rust programs are still vulnerable to severe security attacks which may defeat its safety guarantees. Existing studies on Rust security focus on the detection of vulnerabilities but seldom consider the bug fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for Rust developers to understand and fix bugs manually, due to Rust’s advanced language features. In this paper, we present Rupair, an automated rectification system, to detect and fix one sort of the most severe Rust vulnerabilities—buffer overflows, and to help developers release secure Rust projects. The key technical component of Rupair is a novel security oriented lightweight data-flow analysis algorithm, which makes use of Rust’s two primary intermediate representations and works across the boundary of Rust’s safe and unsafe sub-languages. To evaluate the effectiveness of Rupair, we first apply it to all 4 reported buffer overflow-related CVEs and vulnerabilities (as of June 20, 2021). Experiment results demonstrated that Rupair successfully detected and rectified all these CVEs. To testify the scalability of Rupair, we collected 36 open-source Rust projects from 8 different application domains, consisting of 5,108,432 lines of Rust source code, and applied Rupair on these projects. Experiment results showed that Rupair successfully identified 14 previously undiscovered buffer overflow vulnerabilities in these projects, and rectified all of them. Moreover, Rupair is efficient, only introduced 3.6% overhead to each rectified Rust program on average.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) components are routinely integrated into software systems that need to perform complex tasks such as image or natural language processing. The adequacy of the test data used to test such systems can be assessed by their ability to expose artificially injected faults (mutations) that simulate real DL faults. In this paper, we describe an approach to automatically generate new test inputs that can be used to augment the existing test set so that its capability to detect DL mutations increases. Our tool DEEPMETIS implements a search based input generation strategy. To account for the non-determinism of the training and the mutation processes, our fitness function involves multiple instances of the DL model under test. Experimental results show that DEEPMETIS is effective at augmenting the given test set, increasing its capability to detect mutants by 63% on average. A leave-one-out experiment shows that the augmented test set is capable of exposing unseen mutants, which simulate the occurrence of yet undetected faults.",

In this paper we briefly describe the technical process of digitization, and the possibilities opened up by converting the transactional information contained in the stock books into structured data. We then set this in the historical context of network structures, as embodied by the World Wide Web and social media, and especially the distinction that these types of network have entrenched between objects (or persons) and topics (or other abstract entities). We conclude with an argument that problematizing this distinction – which is enshrined in the whole concept of networks and network analysis – is key if this method is to be applied to art history research.",

In this work, we introduce a new dynamic approach for inferring the asymptotic complexity bounds of recursive programs. From program execution traces, we learn recurrence relations and solve them using pattern matching to obtain closed-form solutions representing the complexity bounds of the program. This approach allows us to efficiently infer simple recurrence relations that represent nontrivial, potentially nonlinear polynomial and non-polynomial, complexity bounds. We present Dynaplex, a tool that implements these ideas to automatically generate recurrence relations from execution traces. Our preliminary results on popular and challenging recursive programs show that Dynaplex can learn precise relations capturing worst-case complexity bounds (e.g., O(n logn) for mergesort, O(2n) for Tower of Hanoi and O(n1.58) for Karatsuba’s multiplication algorithm).",

It is important to understand why technological advances do not sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure code. To widen our understanding of developers' behaviour, we considered the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory from cognitive and social psychology. Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps. Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors. Interventions will be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication, psychological frameworks, and usability. Our analysis suggests “adaptive security interventions” as a solution that responds to the changing security needs of individual developers and a present a proof-of-concept tool to substantiate our suggestion.",

Since any two users are unlikely to look in the exact same direction as each other throughout the viewing of a video, the frame-by-frame video sequence displayed during a playback session is typically unique. This complicates the direct comparison of the perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) using popular metrics such as the Multiscale-Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM). Furthermore, there is an absence of light-weight emulation frameworks for tiled-based 360° video streaming that allow easy testing of different algorithm designs and tile sizes. To address these challenges, we present REEFT-360, which consists of (1) a real-time emulation framework that captures tile-quality adaptation under time-varying bandwidth conditions and (2) a multi-step evaluation process that allows the calculation of MS-SSIM scores and other frame-based metrics, while accounting for the user's head movements. Importantly, the framework allows speedy implementation and testing of alternative head-movement prediction and tile-based prefetching solutions, allows testing under a wide range of network conditions, and can be used either with a human user or head-movement traces. The developed software tool is shared with the paper. We also present proof-of-concept evaluation results that highlight the importance of including a human subject in the evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Security patches in open source software, providing security fixes to identified vulnerabilities, are crucial in protecting against cyber attacks. Security advisories and announcements are often publicly released to inform the users about potential security vulnerability. Despite the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) publishes identified vulnerabilities, a vast majority of vulnerabilities and their corresponding security patches remain beyond public exposure, e.g., in the open source libraries that are heavily relied on by developers. As many of these patches exist in open sourced projects, the problem of curating and gathering security patches can be difficult due to their hidden nature. An extensive and complete security patches dataset could help end-users such as security companies, e.g., building a security knowledge base, or researcher, e.g., aiding in vulnerability research.To efficiently curate security patches including undisclosed patches at large scale and low cost, we propose a deep neural-network-based approach built upon commits of open source repositories. First, we design and build security patch datasets that include 38,291 security-related commits and 1,045 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) patches from four large-scale C programming language libraries. We manually verify each commit, among the 38,291 security-related commits, to determine if they are security related.We devise and implement a deep learning-based security patch identification system that consists of two composite neural networks: one commit-message neural network that utilizes pretrained word representations learned from our commits dataset and one code-revision neural network that takes code before revision and after revision and learns the distinction on the statement level. Our system leverages the power of the two networks for Security Patch Identification. Evaluation results show that our system significantly outperforms SVM and K-fold stacking algorithms. The result on the combined dataset achieves as high as 87.93% F1-score and precision of 86.24%.We deployed our pipeline and learned model in an industrial production environment to evaluate the generalization ability of our approach. The industrial dataset consists of 298,917 commits from 410 new libraries that range from a wide functionalities. Our experiment results and observation on the industrial dataset proved that our approach can identify security patches effectively among open sourced projects.",

Using DevOps, a collection of modern software lifecycle management tactics, we propose to build an integrated platform to manage the OOE tasks. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and Infrastructure as Code, which are key aspects of DevOps, coordinate the building, testing, and deployment of software services. To bring the corresponding benefits of pure software systems to industrial CPS, we integrate engineering tasks using distributed version control and the W3C Web of Things. As a proof of concept, we implemented the concept for a mock system that includes the OOE tasks in a process automation scenario. The DevOps platform provides a structured transfer and exchange of engineering knowledge among stakeholders involved in industrial CPS.",

        "abstract": "Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes, i.e., either based on the operation codes (opcodes) of the smart contract binaries or the transaction patterns of addresses. However, state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability and high false positive rates. Moreover, machine-learning based methods are susceptible to evasion techniques, and transaction-based techniques do not work on smart contracts that have a small number of transactions. These limitations render existing methods for detecting Ponzi schemes ineffective. In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, by strictly following the definition of Ponzi schemes, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to first generate the semantic information for each feasible path in smart contracts and then identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims. Our observations confirm the urgency of identifying and mitigating Ponzi schemes in the blockchain ecosystem.",

We install a fisheye camera on the top of the phone to achieve a panoramic vision that can capture both user’s body and on-screen hands. Based on the captured video stream, we develop an algorithm to extract 1) features for user tracking, including body keypoints and their temporal and spatial association, near field hand status, and 2) features for user identity assignment.

However, the collection of security patches still remains a challenging problem. Existing works mainly adopt a matching-based design that uses auxiliary information in CVE/NVD to reduce the search scope of patch commits. However, our preliminary study shows that these approaches can only cover a small part of disclosed OSS vulnerabilities (about 12%-53%) even with manual assistance. To facilitate the collection of OSS security patches, this paper proposes a ranking-based approach, named PatchScout, which ranks the code commits in the OSS code repository based on their correlations to a given vulnerability. By exploiting the broad correlations between a vulnerability and code commits, patch commits are expected to be put to front positions in the ranked results. Compared with existing works, our approach could help to locate more security patches and meet a balance between the patch coverage and the manual efforts involved. We evaluate PatchScout with 685 OSS CVEs and the results show that it helps to locate 92.70% patches with acceptable manual workload. To further demonstrate the utility of PatchScout, we perform a study on 5 popular OSS projects and 225 CVEs to understand the patch deployment practice across branches, and we obtain many new findings.",

This paper analyzes the main reasons for such slowdown and introduces an effective containerization framework, FlashCube. Instead of building a container from scratch, FlashCube quickly and efficiently assembles it through a group of pre-created general container parts (e.g., namespaces, cgroups, and language runtimes). In addition, FlashCube's user-space implementation makes it easily applicable to existing commodity serverless platforms. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates that FlashCube can quickly provision containerized functions in less than 10 ms (vs. ~400 ms using Docker containers).",

However, fragmentation unleashed by its underlying concepts hinders different stakeholders from effectively utilizing blockchain-supported services, resulting in the obstruction of its wide-scale adoption. To explore synergies among the isolated frameworks requires comprehensively studying inter-blockchain communication approaches. These approaches broadly come under the umbrella of Blockchain Interoperability (BI) notion, as it can facilitate a novel paradigm of an integrated blockchain ecosystem that connects state-of-the-art disparate blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of studies that comprehensively review BI, which works as a stumbling block in its development. Therefore, this article aims to articulate potential of BI by reviewing it from diverse perspectives. Beginning with a glance of blockchain architecture fundamentals, this article discusses its associated platforms, taxonomy, and consensus mechanisms. Subsequently, it argues about BI’s requirement by exemplifying its potential opportunities and application areas. Concerning BI, an architecture seems to be a missing link. Hence, this article introduces a layered architecture for the effective development of protocols and methods for interoperable blockchains. Furthermore, this article proposes an in-depth BI research taxonomy and provides an insight into the state-of-the-art projects.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to produce a large variety of martial arts movements in a controllable manner from raw motion capture data. Our method imitates animation layering using neural networks with the aim to overcome typical challenges when mixing, blending and editing movements from unaligned motion sources. The framework can synthesize novel movements from given reference motions and simple user controls, and generate unseen sequences of locomotion, punching, kicking, avoiding and combinations thereof, but also reconstruct signature motions of different fighters, as well as close-character interactions such as clinching and carrying by learning the spatial joint relationships. To achieve this goal, we adopt a modular framework which is composed of the motion generator and a set of different control modules. The motion generator functions as a motion manifold that projects novel mixed/edited trajectories to natural full-body motions, and synthesizes realistic transitions between different motions. The control modules are task dependent and can be developed and trained separately by engineers to include novel motion tasks, which greatly reduces network iteration time when working with large-scale datasets. Our modular framework provides a transparent control interface for animators that allows modifying or combining movements after network training, and enables iterative adding of control modules for different motion tasks and behaviors. Our system can be used for offline and online motion generation alike, and is relevant for real-time applications such as computer games.",

        "abstract": "The use of design fiction to speculate an imaginative and critical future has increasingly been recognized in the design research community. Instead of focusing on speculation with a critical position, this paper reports an experiential approach to entangling everyday experiences in the process of speculating. As science fiction has successfully provided fictional-world-building as entanglement material for speculation, we held a workshop to conduct an entanglement experiment of personal photographs with cyberpunk literature, Neuromancer. We built a card deck consisting of 206 quotes from the novel and invited 15 participants to shuffle, draw, and re-compose sentences that best matched their personal photographs. Purposefully selected everyday anchors and sci-fi features in the quotes allowed us to investigate the moment when an everyday photograph encountered a fictional world. We describe the phenomena of imagination and entanglement, explain experiential entanglement, propose a conceptual model for entangled status, and present interpretations and implications in HCI.",

        "abstract": "Backscattering tags transmit passively without an on-board active radio transmitter. Almost all present-day backscatter systems, however, rely on active radio receivers. This presents a significant scalability, power and cost challenge for backscatter systems. To overcome this barrier, recent research has empowered these passive tags with the ability to reliably receive backscatter signals from other tags. This forms the building block of passive networks wherein tags talk to each other without an active radio on either the transmit or receive side. For wider functionality, accurate localization of such tags is critical. All known backscatter tag localization techniques rely on active receivers for measuring and characterizing the received signal. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to passive tag-to-tag networks. This paper overcomes the gap by developing a localization technique for such passive networks based on a novel method for phase-based ranging in passive receivers. This method allows pairs of passive tags to collaboratively determine the inter-tag channel phase while effectively minimizing the effects of multipath and noise in the surrounding environment. Building on this, we develop a localization technique that benefits from large link diversity uniquely available in a passive tag-to-tag network. We evaluate the performance of our techniques with extensive micro-benchmarking experiments in an indoor environment using fabricated prototypes of tag hardware. We show that our phase-based ranging performs similar to active receivers, providing median 1D ranging error <1 cm and median localization error also <1 cm. Benefiting from the large-scale link diversity our localization technique outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques that use active receivers.",

The literature shows that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems adopting classification models based on time series shapelets can be interpretable, more accurate, and significantly fast. Thus, in order to design a data-agnostic and interpretable classification approach, in this paper we first extend the notion of shapelets to different types of data, i.e., images, tabular and textual data. Then, based on this extended notion of shapelets we propose an interpretable data-agnostic classification method. Since the shapelets discovery can be time consuming, especially for data types more complex than time series, we exploit a notion of prototypes for finding candidate shapelets, and reducing both the time required to find a solution and the variance of shapelets. A wide experimentation on datasets of different types shows that the data-agnostic prototype-based shapelets returned by the proposed method empower an interpretable classification which is also fast, accurate, and stable. In addition, we show and we prove that shapelets can be at the basis of explainable AI methods.",

The potential for this success to continue and accelerate has placed machine learning (ML) at the top of research, economic, and political agendas.

Achieving this vision requires the use of ML in safety-critical applications that demand levels of assurance beyond those needed for current ML applications. Our article provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the assurance of ML, i.e., in the generation of evidence that ML is sufficiently safe for its intended use. The survey covers the methods capable of providing such evidence at different stages of the machine learning lifecycle, i.e., of the complex, iterative process that starts with the collection of the data used to train an ML component for a system, and ends with the deployment of that component within the system. The article begins with a systematic presentation of the ML lifecycle and its stages. We then define assurance desiderata for each stage, review existing methods that contribute to achieving these desiderata, and identify open challenges that require further research.",

However, behavioral safety in applying deep-neural-network-based (DNN based) systems for self-driving cars could not be guaranteed. Several real-world accidents involving self-driving cars have already happened, some of which have led to fatal collisions. In this paper, we present a novel and automated technique for verifying steering angle safety for self-driving cars. The technique is based on deep learning verification (DLV), which is an automated verification framework for safety of image classification neural networks. We extend DLV by leveraging neuron coverage and slack relationship to solve the judgement problem of predicted behaviors, and thus, to achieve verification of steering angle safety for self-driving cars. We evaluate our technique on the NVIDIA’s end-to-end self-driving architecture, which is a crucial ingredient in many modern self-driving cars. Experimental results show that our technique can successfully find adversarial misclassifications (i.e., incorrect steering decisions) within given regions if they exist. Therefore, we can achieve safety verification (if no misclassification is found for all DNN layers, in which case the network can be said to be stable or reliable w.r.t. steering decisions) or falsification (in which case the adversarial examples can be used to fine-tune the network).",

Despite its promise, HE has seen limited use due to performance overheads and compilation challenges. Recent work has made significant advances to address the performance overheads but automatic compilation of efficient HE kernels remains relatively unexplored.  This paper presents Porcupine, an optimizing compiler that generates vectorized HE code using program synthesis. HE poses three major compilation challenges: it only supports a limited set of SIMD-like operators, it uses long-vector operands, and decryption can fail if ciphertext noise growth is not managed properly. Porcupine captures the underlying HE operator behavior so that it can automatically reason about the complex trade-offs imposed by these challenges to generate optimized, verified HE kernels. To improve synthesis time, we propose a series of optimizations including a sketch design tailored to HE to narrow the program search space. We evaluate Porcupine using a set of kernels and show speedups of up to 52% (25% geometric mean) compared to heuristic-driven hand-optimized kernels. Analysis of Porcupine’s synthesized code reveals that optimal solutions are not always intuitive, underscoring the utility of automated reasoning in this domain.",

One important class of such complex vulnerabilities is what we call \"high-order taint style vulnerability\", where the taint flow from the user input to the vulnerable site crosses the boundary of a single entry function invocation (i.e., syscall). Due to the large scope and high precision requirement, few have attempted to solve the problem. In this paper, we present SUTURE, a highly precise and scalable static analysis tool capable of discovering high-order vulnerabilities in OS kernels. SUTURE employs a novel summary-based high-order taint flow construction approach to efficiently enumerate the cross-entry taint flows, while incorporating multiple innovative enhancements on analysis precision that are unseen in existing tools, resulting in a highly precise inter-procedural flow-, context-, field-, index-, and opportunistically path-sensitive static taint analysis. We apply SUTURE to discover high-order taint vulnerabilities in multiple Android kernels from mainstream vendors (e.g., Google, Samsung, Huawei), the results show that SUTURE can both confirm known high-order vulnerabilities and uncover new ones. So far, SUTURE generates 79 true positive warning groups, of which 19 have been confirmed by the vendors, including a high severity vulnerability rated by Google. SUTURE also achieves a reasonable false positive rate (51.23%) perceived by users of our tool.",

With practical knowledge becoming easily accessible to clients, architects and urban planners, we notice a shift from traditional advertising screens to integrated context-aware installations. The challenge now becomes to understand investment return of media architecture in order to ensure ongoing support by clients and funders. In this paper we study The Digital Bricks, a 208 megapixel media façade integrated within a university building. We describe the project vision, engagement strategy and design outcome, and analyse in detail the business case for the project. We share considerations to support development of business cases for media architecture projects that favour engagement, cultural and innovation capacity over financial returns. As the discipline matures, our insights will help in the endeavour to convince clients to invest in media architecture that inspires and engages audiences.",

        "abstract": "Background: Distributed data-intensive systems are increasingly designed to be only eventually consistent. Persistent data is no longer processed with serialized and transactional access, exposing applications to a range of potential concurrency anomalies that need to be handled by the application itself. Controlling concurrent data access in monolithic systems is already challenging, but the problem is exacerbated in distributed systems. To make it worse, only little systematic engineering guidance is provided by the software architecture community regarding this issue. Aims: In this paper, we report on our study of the effectiveness and applicability of the novel design guidelines we are proposing in this regard. Method: We used action research and conducted it in the context of the software architecture design process of a multi-site platform development project. Results: Our hypotheses regarding effectiveness and applicability have been accepted in the context of the study. The initial design guidelines were refined throughout the study. Thus, we also contribute concrete guidelines for architecting distributed data-intensive systems with eventually consistent data. The guidelines are an advancement of Domain-Driven Design and provide additional patterns for the tactical design part. Conclusions: Based on our results, we recommend using the guidelines to architect safe eventually consistent systems. Because of the relevance of distributed data-intensive systems, we will drive this research forward and evaluate it in further domains.",

        "abstract": "Programming languages like P4 enable specifying the behavior of network data planes in software. However, with increasingly powerful and complex applications running in the network, the risk of faults also increases. Hence, there is growing recognition of the need for methods and tools to statically verify the correctness of P4 code, especially as the language lacks basic safety guarantees. Type systems are a lightweight and compositional way to establish program properties, but there is a significant gap between the kinds of properties that can be proved using simple type systems (e.g., SafeP4) and those that can be obtained using full-blown verification tools (e.g., p4v). In this paper, we close this gap by developing Π4, a dependently-typed version of P4 based on decidable refinements. We motivate the design of Π4, prove the soundness of its type system, develop an SMT-based implementation, and present case studies that illustrate its applicability to a variety of data plane programs.",

        "abstract": "Cryptographic techniques have the potential to enable distrusting parties to collaborate in fundamentally new ways, but their practical implementation poses numerous challenges. An important class of such cryptographic techniques is known as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Developing Secure MPC applications in realistic scenarios requires extensive knowledge spanning multiple areas of cryptography and systems. And while the steps to arrive at a solution for a particular application are often straightforward, it remains difficult to make the implementation efficient, and tedious to apply those same steps to a slightly different application from scratch. Hence, it is an important problem to design platforms for implementing Secure MPC applications with minimum effort and using techniques accessible to non-experts in cryptography.  In this paper, we present the HACCLE (High Assurance Compositional Cryptography: Languages and Environments) toolchain, specifically targeted to MPC applications. HACCLE contains an embedded domain-specific language Harpoon, for software developers without cryptographic expertise to write MPC-based programs, and uses Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) for code generation.  Harpoon programs are compiled into acyclic circuits represented in HACCLE’s Intermediate Representation (HIR) that serves as an abstraction over different cryptographic protocols such as secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, or garbled circuits. Implementations of different cryptographic protocols serve as different backends of our toolchain. The extensible design of HIR allows cryptographic experts to plug in new primitives and protocols to realize computation. And the use of standard metaprogramming techniques lowers the development effort significantly.  We have implemented Harpoon and HACCLE, and used them to program interesting applications (e.g., secure auction) and key computation components of Secure MPC applications (e.g., matrix-vector multiplication and merge sort). We show that the performance is improved by using our optimization strategies and heuristics.",

Our language comprises a set of core constructs for expressing high-level computation detail and a set of what we call reshape operators, which can be derived from core constructs but trigger low-level decisions about storage patterns and ordering. We demonstrate that not only is this system capable of deriving the optimizations of existing state-of-the-art languages like Halide and generating comparably performant code, it is also able to schedule a family of useful program transformations beyond what is reachable in Halide.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, vaccine incidents occurred around the world, which endangers people’s lives. In the technical respect, these incidents are partially due to the fact that existing vaccine management systems are distributively managed by different entities in the vaccine supply chain. This architecture makes it relatively easy to modify or even delete the vaccine circulation data maliciously, which makes tracing problematic vaccine hard and identifying the responsibility for a vaccine accident hard. To solve these issues, this article presents a blockchain-based solution to protect the whole process of vaccine circulation. We first propose a model to supervise the vaccine circulation process by incorporating existing regulatory practices. Then, we propose a blockchain-based tracing system to implement this model. The proposed system takes the blockchain as a global, unique, and verifiable database to store all the circulation data. Through data insertions and queries on the global and unique database, the proposed system achieves the protection of vaccine circulation. We also implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed system. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system is beneficial.",

We find that these don't-guidelines go far beyond UI aesthetics, and involve seven general design dimensions (layout, typography, iconography, navigation, communication, color, and shape) and four component design aspects (anatomy, placement, behavior, and usage). Violating these guidelines results in visual design smells in UIs (or UI design smells). In a study of 60,756 UIs of 9,286 Android apps, we find that 7,497 UIs of 2,587 apps have at least one violation of some Material Design guidelines. This reveals the lack of developer training and tool support to avoid UI design smells. To fill this gap, we design an automated UI design smell detector (UIS-Hunter) that extracts and validates multi-modal UI information (component metadata, typography, iconography, color, and edge) for detecting the violation of diverse don't-guidelines in Material Design. The detection accuracy of UIS-Hunter is high (precision=0.81, recall=0.90) on the 60,756 UIs of 9,286 apps. We build a guideline gallery with real-world UI design smells that UIS-Hunter detects for developers to learn the best Material Design practices.

Current research often assumes a one-shot interaction paradigm, where the users’ preferences are estimated based on past observed behavior and where the presentation of a ranked list of suggestions is the main, one-directional form of user interaction. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can, for example, help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing, the emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants, and the increased use of chatbot technology. With this article, we provide a detailed survey of existing approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in various dimensions, e.g., in terms of the supported user intents or the knowledge they use in the background. Moreover, we discuss technological approaches, review how CRS are evaluated, and finally identify a number of gaps that deserve more research in the future.",

However, assumptions like this tend to lead to failures in challenging cases even undergo costly training since they usually don't hold in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, our model achieves to be invariant to facial biases by learning through the landmark-anchored distributions. Specifically, we generate faces from these distributions, then group them based on the appearance sources and the probe facial landmarks into intra-identities and intra-landmarks classes, respectively. Thus, we construct intra-class invariance losses to disentangle the spatial structures from appearances. In addition, we adopt a reconstruction loss to produce more realistic faces with probe landmarks. Extensive experimental results on four standard facial landmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves compelling performance compared with supervised and unsupervised methods.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper presents counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) to automatically synthesise probabilistic models. The starting point is a family of finite-stateMarkov chains with related but distinct topologies. Such families can succinctly be described by a sketch of a probabilistic program. Program sketches are programs containing holes. Every hole has a finite repertoire of possible program snippets by which it can be filled.We study several synthesis problems—feasibility, optimal synthesis, and complete partitioning—for a given quantitative specification φ. Feasibility amounts to determine a family member satisfying φ, optimal synthesis amounts to find a family member that maximises the probability to satisfy φ, and complete partitioning splits the family in satisfying and refuting members. Each of these problems can be considered under the additional constraint of minimising the total cost of instantiations, e.g., what are all possible instantiations for φ that are within a certain budget? The synthesis problems are tackled using a CEGIS approach. The crux is to aggressively prune the search space by using counterexamples provided by a probabilistic model checker. Counterexamples can be viewed as sub-Markov chains that rule out all family members that share this sub-chain. Our CEGIS approach leverages efficient probabilisticmodel checking,modern SMT solving, and programsnippets as counterexamples. Experiments on case studies froma diverse nature—controller synthesis, program sketching, and security—show that synthesis among up to a million candidate designs can be done using a few thousand verification queries.",

        "abstract": "Displacement mapping is a powerful mechanism for adding fine to medium geometric details over a 3D surface using a 2D map encoding them. While GPU rasterization supports it through the hardware tessellation unit, ray tracing surface meshes textured with high quality displacement requires a significant amount of memory. More precisely, the input surface needs to be pre-tessellated at the displacement map resolution before being enriched with its mandatory acceleration data structure. Consequently, designing displacement maps interactively while enjoying a full physically-based rendering is often impossible, as simply tiling multiple times the map quickly saturates the graphics memory. In this work we introduce a new tessellation-free displacement mapping approach for ray tracing. Our key insight is to decouple the displacement from its base domain by mapping a displacement-specific acceleration structures directly on the mesh. As a result, our method shows low memory footprint and fast high resolution displacement rendering, making interactive displacement editing possible.",

The paper provides evidence that the practice is quite common among curators, that is used as part of their collaborative practices, and that the embedded knowledge can be mined by algorithms. Further, this meta-knowledge can be integrated, using neuro-symbolic algorithms, to the machine learning-based conversational system, to improve its run-time accuracy and to enable tools to support curatorial tasks. Those results point towards new ways of designing development tools which explore an integrated use of code and documentation by machines.",

        "abstract": "The solution space of detailed placement becomes intractable with increase in thenumber of placeable cells and their possible locations. So, the existing works either focus on the sliding window-based optimization or row-based optimization. Though these region-based methods enable us to use linear-programming, pseudo-greedy or dynamic-programming algorithms, locally optimal solutions from these methods are globally sub-optimal with inherent heuristics. The heuristics such as the order in which we choose these local problems or size of each sliding window (runtime vs. optimality tradeoff) account for the degradation of solution quality. Our hypothesis is that learning-based techniques (with their richer representation ability) have shown a great success in problems with huge solution spaces, and can offer an alternative to the existing rudimentary heuristics. We propose a two-stage detailed-placement algorithm RLPlace that uses reinforcement learning (RL) for coarse re-arrangement and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) for fine-grain refinement. With global placement output of two critical IPs as the start point, RLPlace achieves upto 1.35% HPWL improvement as compared to the commercial tool's detailed-placement result. In addition, RLPlace shows at least 1.2% HPWL improvement over highly optimized detailed-placement variants of the two IPs.",

Therefore, based on neural network algorithm, this paper studies AI broadcasting host expression technology. Firstly, this paper expounds the concept of AI broadcasting, and then expounds the impact of AI on future broadcasting hosts and the problems of existing AI broadcasting. Finally, according to the optimization of neural network algorithm, this paper tests all aspects of AI broadcast host expression technology. The test results show that after the optimization of neural network algorithm, the average value of emotional expression of AI broadcast host is relatively stable in expression technology, and the audio output is also stable. At the same time, there is a sense of law in speech speed and speech rhythm, but it will still be unstable.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has made great progress in medical diagnosis. However, due to data standardization and privacy restriction, the acquisition and sharing of medical image data have been hindered, leading to the unacceptable accuracy of some intelligent medical diagnosis models. Another concern is data quality. If insufficient quantity and low-quality data are used for training and testing medical diagnosis models, it may cause serious medical accidents. We always use data augmentation to deal with it, and one of the most representative ways is through mutation relation. However, although common mutation methods can increase the amount of medical data, the quality of the image cannot be guaranteed due to the particularity of medical image. Therefore, combined with the characteristics of medical images, we propose TauMed, which implements augmentation techniques based on a series of mutation rules and domain semantics on medical datasets to generate sufficient and high-quality images. Moreover, we chose the ResNet-50 model to experiment with the augmented dataset and compared the results with two main popular mutation tools. The experimental result indicates that TauMed can improve the classification accuracy of the model effectively, and the quality of augmented images is higher than the other two tools.

In addition to the intrinsic value of being inclusive, looking to the 2LGBTQIA+ community can help us to break away from traditional ideas of gender and sexuality, to unlock the full potential of this technology to be flexible and offer new possibilities. Further, we reflect on the importance of considering how the designs of sex robots, as politically charged technological artifacts, can contribute to reinforcing ideas about heteronormativity; instead, sex robots have the potential to positively contribute to breaking down traditional barriers surrounding gender and sex. We envision a future of sex robots that reach their full potential as fluid, individualized companions that enable people to comfortably engage their interests and identity.",

This study focuses on how moderators (mods) make decisions about their actions after the violation takes place but before the sanction by examining how they \"profile\" the violators. Through observations and interviews with volunteer mods on Twitch, we found that mods engage in a complex process of collaborative evidence collection and profile violators into different categories to decide the type and extent of punishment. Mods consider violators' characteristics as well as behavioral history and violation context before taking moderation action. The main purpose of the profiling was to avoid excessive punishment and aim to integrate violators more into the community. We discuss the contributions of profiling to moderation practice and suggest design mechanisms to facilitate mods' profiling processes.",

To enable natural thumb-to-finger interaction, we develop a high-frequency AC circuit for on-body contact detection. Based on the sensing information of DualRing, we outline the interaction space and divide it into three sub-spaces: within-hand interaction, hand-to-surface interaction, and hand-to-object interaction. By analyzing the accuracy and performance of our system, we demonstrate the informational advantage of DualRing in sensing comprehensive hand gestures compared with single-ring-based solutions.

In recent years, many tools have been developed to help understand attacks using visualisation, but few aim to predict real-world consequences. We have developed a visualisation tool that aims to improve decision support during attacks in Security Operation Centres (SOCs). Our tool visualises propagation of risks from sensor alert data to Business Process (BP) tasks. This is an important capability gap present in many SOCs today, as most threat detection tools are technology-centric. In this article, we present a user study that assesses our tool’s usability and ability to support the analyst. Ten analysts from seven SOCs performed carefully designed tasks related to understanding risks and recovery decision-making. The study was conducted in laboratory conditions with simulated attacks and used a mixed-method approach to collect data from questionnaires, eye tracking, and semi-structured interviews. Our findings suggest that relating business tasks to network asset in visualisations can help analysts prioritise response strategies. Finally, our article also provides an in-depth discussion on user studies conducted with SOC analysts more generally, including lessons learned, recommendations and a critique of our own study.",

Classical approaches for testing are not sufficient: A purely statistical approach based on a dataset split is not enough, as testing needs to address various purposes and not only average case performance. Additionally, a complete specification is elusive due to the complexity of the perception task in the open context of automated driving. In this article, we review and discuss existing work on testing DNNs for visual perception with a special focus on automated driving for test input and test oracle generation as well as test adequacy.

This often leads to programs obscure and unintuitive, which not only raise the difficulty of completing experiments, but also raise the difficulty of understanding and relating programs to involving algorithms. To address this issue, we introduced monadic programming which is from functional language background. It shields minor details by a set of monad operators to enable programmers to focus on the main ideas. The similarity between a monadic program and the algorithm behind it also makes it possible for teachers to give effective, comprehensive feedback on students’ programs in time. The teaching reform based on this idea is introduced in detail. And the past three years of practice have shown promising results.",

RPBs are teacher-facing statements that describe what needs to be learned about the behavior of a specific sort of programs. Different programming languages, student cohorts, and contexts call for different RPBs. Instructional designers may define progressions of RPB rulesets for different stages of a programming course or curriculum; we identify evaluation criteria for RPBs and discuss tradeoffs in RPB design. As a proof-of-concept example, we present a progression of rulesets designed for teaching beginners how expressions, variables, and functions work in Python. We submit that the RPB framework is valuable to practitioners and researchers as a tool for design and communication. Within computing education research, the framework can inform, among other things, the ongoing exploration of “notional machines” and the design of assessments and visualizations. The theoretical work that we report here lays a foundation for future empirical research that compares the effectiveness of RPB rulesets as well as different methods for teaching a particular ruleset.",

        "abstract": "Thinking of technology as a design material is appealing. It encourages designers to explore the material’s properties to understand its capabilities and limitations—a prerequisite to generative design thinking. However, as a material, AI resists this approach because its properties only emerge as part of the user experience design. Therefore, designers and AI engineers must collaborate in new ways to create both the material and its application experience. We investigate the co-creation process through a design study with 10 pairs of designers and engineers. We find that design ‘probes’ with user data are a useful tool in defining AI materials. Through data probes, designers construct designerly representations of the envisioned AI experience (AIX) to identify desirable AI characteristics. Data probes facilitate divergent design thinking, material testing, and design validation. Based on our findings, we propose a process model for co-creating AIX and offer design considerations for incorporating data probes in AIX design tools.",

Specifically, the technical innovation image shows fully mediated positive effects on customer participation through both cognitive and affective customer-company identification. However, non-technical innovation image's positive effect on customer participation is partially mediated by affective customer-company identification. non-technical innovation image's effect on cognitive customer-company identification is not significant.",

When, in 2020, the situation of social isolation imposed on the world by the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, only the audiovisual image continued to travel between media, to transit in the interstices, across borders, towards the meeting with the other, as a being of passage and of uncertain nature and identities, adrift through networks, whether as an archive or in real time. In this context, it is worth reflecting on video as a media-image and metaphor of contemporary man himself: borderless, nomadic, in constant flux, which, even without being able to transit, surpassed technological mediation, becoming an omnipresence whether in video files or video in real time here we name videonomadism. The phenomenon of telepresence, already experienced, is here expanded to think of the video image as a symbol of the diaspora image, drift. It is about thinking video as a contemporary cultural phenomenon aiming to describe the complexity of the videographic system. For this, we opted for decolonial approaches whose critical stance and contrary to the hegemonic and canonical systems of the history of art and culture, have significantly contributed to the production of other perspectives on phenomena such as media, technology, and art, and by extension as we intend with this research, promote new readings of video art. The basic reasoning was mainly related to the decolonial approach of Latin American authors such as Zulma Palermo [8] and Boaventura de Souza Santos [9], having as object of study, the video Small fragments of a suspension machine with interstices by Paloma Oliveira and Mateus Knelsen who was part of the first Pink Umbrellas Art Residency Festival, curated by artists Mirella Brandi and Mueptemo [12], whose video works are audiovisual site specifics created collaboratively by artist duos and exclusively for the Internet.",

Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people’s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel and robust long-term tracking algorithm to address continuous target tracking problems. The continuous target tracking demands handling of correct re-initialization of the lost target when it reappears. The main limitation of the currently popular Siamese class of deep trackers is their inability to re-initialize a target when it is lost for sufficiently long duration or when it re-appears at a location away from the lost location. Most of the Siamese class of deep trackers search for the lost targets in a limited region, close to where it disappears. Hence, they fail in automated re-initialization, tracking resumption and maintaining track after long-term occlusion or tracker-loss. This puts a serious impediment on the current state-of-the-art deep tracker frameworks for many real applications. Here, we propose integration of a lightweight and efficient Cascaded Classifier based detection mechanism with the Siamese trackers for re-initialization of the target. While the proposed approach is generic and applicable to all Siamese class of deep trackers, we have taken SiamRPN++ as a base tracker to illustrate the effectiveness of our tracking framework. The proposition enables Cascaded Classifier based detector to adaptively direct the search region for the base tracker. Extensive experimental results on the well known tracking benchmark datasets such as UAV123, VOT2019, VOT2016, VOT2018 and VOT2018-LT show that the proposed integration significantly improves the performance of the base tracker under occlusion and tracker-loss scenarios. Further, the proposed tracker improves the precision by 1.71% and the recall by 13.98% over the base tracker for the long-term tracking on the VOT2018-LT dataset.",

Our theoretical results indicate that, for any sample size in the target domain, the proposed TLCp estimator performs better than the Cp estimator by the mean squared error (MSE) metric in the case of orthogonal predictors, provided that i) the dissimilarity between the tasks from source domain and target domain is small, and ii) the procedure parameters (complexity penalties) are tuned according to certain explicit rules. Moreover, we show that our transfer learning framework can be extended to other feature selection criteria, such as the Bayesian information criterion. By analyzing the solution of the orthogonalized Cp, we identify an estimator that asymptotically approximates the solution of the Cp criterion in the case of non-orthogonal predictors. Similar results are obtained for the non-orthogonal TLCp. Finally, simulation studies and applications with real data demonstrate the usefulness of the TLCp scheme.",

We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b) they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC rates under diverse real-world conditions. DeepLight's key innovation is the design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition, DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen extraction (IoU values ≥ 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly achieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high data goodput (≥0.95 Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over larger screen-camera distances (ã 2m).",

Its clinical evaluation relies on a rating system called MDS-UPDRS, which includes subjective and error-prone motor examinations. This paper proposes an objective and interpretable visual system (PD-Net ) to quantitatively evaluate motor function of PD patients using video footage. The PD-Net consists of three modules: 1) a pose detector to infer 21 hand keypoints directly from RGB videos, 2) a movement analysis module to study temporal patterns of hand keypoints and discover motor symptoms, and 3) a scoring module to predict MDS-UPDRS ratings with retrieved symptoms. Trained with an in-house clinical dataset, PD-Net can effectively handle the unique challenges of PD examination videos, such as clinically-defined gestures, distinct self-occlusion/foreshortening effect and contextual background. And it detects hand keypoints of PD patients with an average accuracy of 84.1%, a 32.9% improvement over OpenPose. When compared to the ratings of experienced clinicians, PD-Net achieves an overall MDS-UPDRS rating score accuracy of 87.6% and Cohen's kappa of 0.82 on a testing dataset of 509 examination videos at a level exceeding human raters. This study demonstrates a clinically applicable automated video analysis system for PD clinical evaluation, which can facilitate early detection, routine monitoring, and treatment assessment.",

Analysis shows that two classical models of monitoring and environmental protection systems (“top-down” and “bottom-top”) couldn't be realized because of the state passivity and lack of the trust for the civil society.

In industry, over time, a plethora of CPPSs are developed to satisfy varying customer requirements and changing technologies. Managing variability is challenging, especially in multidisciplinary environments like in CPPS engineering. For instance, when supporting the automatic derivation and configuration of control software, one needs to understand variability from not only a software perspective, but also a mechatronic, electrical, process, and business perspective. It is unrealistic to use a single model or even one type of model across these perspectives. In this paper, we describe a Multidisciplinary Delta-Oriented Variability Management approach for CPPSs that we are currently developing. Our approach aims to express CPPS variability in different disciplines using heterogeneous variability models, relating models via cross-discipline constraints, and automatically generating control software based on variability models. We implemented a prototype of our approach by realizing delta-oriented variability modeling for IEC 61499-based distributed control software and a configuration tool to enact the configuration options from multiple variability models. We performed a feasibility study of our approach using two systems of different size and complexity. We conclude that, despite current limitations, our approach can successfully and automatically generate control software based on related multidisciplinary variability models. We think that our approach is a good starting point to manage CPPS variability in practice.",

As users store more and more photos in the cloud, significant privacy concerns arise because even a single compromise of a user's credentials give attackers unfettered access to all of the user's photos. We have created Easy Secure Photos (ESP) to enable users to protect their photos on cloud photo services such as Google Photos. ESP introduces a new client-side encryption architecture that includes a novel format-preserving image encryption algorithm, an encrypted thumbnail display mechanism, and a usable key management system. ESP encrypts image data such that the result is still a standard format image like JPEG that is compatible with cloud photo services. ESP efficiently generates and displays encrypted thumbnails for fast and easy browsing of photo galleries from trusted user devices. ESP's key management makes it simple to authorize multiple user devices to view encrypted image content via a process similar to device pairing, but using the cloud photo service as a QR code communication channel. We have implemented ESP in a popular Android photos app for use with Google Photos and demonstrate that it is easy to use and provides encryption functionality transparently to users, maintains good interactive performance and image quality while providing strong privacy guarantees, and retains the sharing and storage benefits of Google Photos without any changes to the cloud service.",

        "abstract": "We discover user-preferred picture settings on smart TVs and investigate whether it is possible to predict the users’ picture setting preferences through machine learning methods. We first perform K-means clustering on large-scale smart TV usage log data to understand how users fine-tune the factory default picture settings. Clustering results recognize 3–4 user groups who have reasonably different preferences toward the default settings. By characterizing these user preferences, we come up with new user-preferred picture settings. We perform an in-depth analysis of the newly discovered picture settings regarding diverse TV device characteristics. We also perform lab experiments to demonstrate how these new settings deliver different picture quality than the default. Next, we construct a deep learning-based classifier that learns and predicts the picture setting preferences of the users. The final trained model shows 86% accuracy in predicting users’ decisions to choose a specific picture setting out of four available options.",

We have therefore extended the notion of empowered design and consequent technology appropriations and show that scaffolding, assistance that fades away, is a viable method to facilitate inter-community engagements with technology. This leads to technology appropriation by communities who did not participate in the original design, and they do this independently of the original academic design team. In this paper we report on our project process over an extended period of time. A collaborator and co-author on this paper is an elder from the original community who is acting to extend and adapt the technology with other, distant, communities from the same ethnic group, the ovaHimba.

The crux is that, by leveraging generative machine learning, we can generate fresh test inputs that vary in their high-level features (for images, these include object shape, location, texture, and colour). We demonstrate that our approach is capable of detecting deliberately injected faults as well as new faults in state-of-the-art DNNs, and that in both cases, existing methods are unable to find these faults.",

A leading technology for obtaining time-correlated light measurements are single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), which are extremely sensitive and capable of temporal resolution on the order of tens of picoseconds. However, the rare and expensive optical setups used by researchers have so far prohibited these novel sensing techniques from entering the mass market. Fortunately, SPADs also exist in a radically cheaper and more power-efficient version that has been widely deployed as proximity sensors in mobile devices for almost a decade. These commodity SPAD sensors can be obtained at a mere few cents per detector pixel. However, their inferior data quality and severe technical drawbacks compared to their high-end counterparts necessitate the use of additional optics and suitable processing algorithms. In this paper, we adopt an existing evaluation platform for commodity SPAD sensors, and modify it to unlock time-of-flight (ToF) histogramming and hence computational imaging. Based on this platform, we develop and demonstrate a family of hardware/software systems that, for the first time, implement applications that had so far been limited to significantly more advanced, higher-priced setups: direct ToF depth imaging, non-line-of-sight object tracking, and material classification.",

We present novel explorations that illustrate the potential of CUIs as critical design material, by critiquing present norms and conversing with imaginary species. As micro-level interventions, we show that conversations with diverse futures through CUIs can persuade us to critically shape our discourse on macro-scale concerns of the present, e.g., sustainability.

In this process, teachers found themselves subject to surveilling gazes from parents, school administrators, and students. As a result, teachers had to manipulate the student behavior data to navigate the balance between presenting a professional image to surveillants and enacting care/control that they deemed appropriate. In this paper we locate two nuanced forms of teachers' data work that have been under-studied in CSCW: (1) data work as recontextualizing meanings and (2) data work as resisting surveillance. We discuss teachers' struggle over (in)visibility and their negotiation of autonomy and subjectivity in these two forms of data work.

To ensure early detection of erroneous data and avoid training ML models using bad data, research and industrial practice suggest incorporating a data validation process and tool in ML system development process. Aim: The study investigates the adoption of a data validation process and tool in industrial ML projects. The data validation process demands significant engineering resources for tool development and maintenance. Thus, it is important to identify the best practices for their adoption especially by development teams that are in the early phases of deploying ML-enabled software systems. Method: Action research was conducted at a large-software intensive organization in telecommunications, specifically within the analytics R&D organization for an ML use case of classifying faults from returned hardware telecommunication devices. Results: Based on the evaluation results and learning from our action research, we identified three best practices, three benefits, and two barriers to adopting the data validation process and tool in ML projects. We also propose a data validation framework (DVF) for systematizing the adoption of a data validation process. Conclusions: The results show that adopting a data validation process and tool in ML projects is an effective approach of testing ML-enabled software systems. It requires having an overview of the level of data (feature, dataset, cross-dataset, data stream) at which certain data quality tests can be applied.",

Bayesian optimization sequentially generates new fonts on the fly to progressively increase individuals’ reading speed.

A good GUI design is crucial to the success of the software in the market, but designing a good GUI which requires much innovation and creativity is difficult even to well-trained designers. Besides, the requirement of the rapid development of GUI design also aggravates designers' working load. So, the availability of various automated generated GUIs can help enhance the design personalization and specialization as they can cater to the taste of different designers. To assist designers, we develop a model GUIGAN to automatically generate GUI designs. Different from conventional image generation models based on image pixels, our GUIGAN is to reuse GUI components collected from existing mobile app GUIs for composing a new design that is similar to natural-language generation. Our GUIGAN is based on SeqGAN by modeling the GUI component style compatibility and GUI structure. The evaluation demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms the best of the baseline methods by 30.77% in Fréchet Inception distance (FID) and 12.35% in 1-Nearest Neighbor Accuracy (1-NNA). Through a pilot user study, we provide initial evidence of the usefulness of our approach for generating acceptable brand new GUI designs.",

These applications rely on video pipelines, represented as DAGs of operations, to transform videos, process extracted metadata, and answer questions like, \"Is this intersection congested?\" The latency and resource efficiency of pipelines can be optimized using configurable knobs for each operation (e.g., sampling rate, batch size, or type of hardware used). However, determining efficient configurations is challenging because (a) the configuration search space is exponentially large, and (b) the optimal configuration depends on users' desired latency and cost targets, (c) input video contents may exercise different paths in the DAG and produce a variable amount intermediate results. Existing video analytics and processing systems leave it to the users to manually configure operations and select hardware resources. We present Llama: a heterogeneous and serverless framework for auto-tuning video pipelines. Given an end-to-end latency target, Llama optimizes for cost efficiency by (a) calculating a latency target for each operation invocation, and (b) dynamically running a cost-based optimizer to assign configurations across heterogeneous hardware that best meet the calculated per-invocation latency target. This makes the problem of auto-tuning large video pipelines tractable and allows us to handle input-dependent behavior, conditional branches in the DAG, and execution variability. We describe the algorithms in Llama and evaluate it on a cloud platform using serverless CPU and GPU resources. We show that compared to state-of-the-art cluster and serverless video analytics and processing systems, Llama achieves 7.8x lower latency and 16x cost reduction on average.",

However, various types of graphical glitches may arise from such GUI complexity and have become one of the main component of software compatibility issues. Our study on bug reports from game development teams in NetEase Inc. indicates that graphical glitches frequently occur during the GUI rendering and severely degrade the quality of graphically-rich applications such as video games. Existing automated testing techniques for such applications focus mainly on generating various GUI test sequences and check whether the test sequences can cause crashes. These techniques require constant human attention to captures non-crashing bugs such as bugs causing graphical glitches. In this paper, we present the first step in automating the test oracle for detecting non-crashing bugs in graphically-rich applications. Specifically, we propose GLIB based on a code-based data augmentation technique to detect game GUI glitches. We perform an evaluation of GLIB on 20 real-world game apps (with bug reports available) and the result shows that GLIB can achieve 100% precision and 99.5% recall in detecting non-crashing bugs such as game GUI glitches. Practical application of GLIB on another 14 real-world games (without bug reports) further demonstrates that GLIB can effectively uncover GUI glitches, with 48 of 53 bugs reported by GLIB having been confirmed and fixed so far.",

In this work, we reexamine the inter-related problems of “topic identification” and “text segmentation” for sparse document learning, when there is a single new text of interest. In developing a methodology to handle single documents, we face two major challenges. First is sparse information: with access to only one document, we cannot train traditional topic models or deep learning algorithms. Second is significant noise: a considerable portion of words in any single document will produce only noise and not help discern topics or segments. To tackle these issues, we design an unsupervised, computationally efficient methodology called Biclustering Approach to Topic modeling and Segmentation (BATS). BATS leverages three key ideas to simultaneously identify topics and segment text: (i) a new mechanism that uses word order information to reduce sample complexity, (ii) a statistically sound graph-based biclustering technique that identifies latent structures of words and sentences, and (iii) a collection of effective heuristics that remove noise words and award important words to further improve performance. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines when considering topic coherence, topic diversity, segmentation, and runtime comparison metrics.",

This extra complexity allows for a rich browsing experience, but it hurts the majority of mobile users which still pay for their traffic. This has motivated several data-saving solutions, which aim at reducing the complexity of webpages by transforming their content. Despite each method being unique, they either reduce user privacy by further centralizing web traffic through data-saving middleboxes or introduce web compatibility (Web-compat) issues by removing content that breaks pages in unpredictable ways.  In this paper, we argue that data-saving is still possible without impacting either users privacy or Web-compat. Our main observation is that Web images make up a large portion of Web traffic and have negligible impact on Web-compat. To this end we make two main contributions. First, we quantify the potential savings that image manipulation, such as dimension resizing, quality compression, and transcoding, enables at large scale: 300 landing and 880 internal pages. Next, we design and build BrowseLite, an entirely client-side tool that achieves such data savings through opportunistically instrumenting existing server-side tooling to perform image compression, while simultaneously reducing the total amount of image data fetched. The effect of BrowseLite on the user experience is quantified using standard page load metrics and a real user study of over 200 users across 50 optimized web pages. BrowseLite allows for similar savings to middlebox approaches, while offering additional security, privacy, and Web-compat guarantees.",

        "abstract": "To achieve high performance with FPGA-equipped heterogeneous compute systems, it is crucial to co-optimize data placement and compute scheduling to maximize data reuse and bandwidth utilization for both on- and off-chip memory accesses. However, optimizing the data placement for FPGA accelerators is a complex task. One must acquire in-depth knowledge of the target FPGA device and its associated memory system in order to apply a set of advanced optimizations. Even with the latest high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, programmers often have to insert many low-level vendor-specific pragmas and substantially restructure the algorithmic code so that the right data are accessed at the right loop level using the right communication schemes. These code changes can significantly compromise the composability and portability of the original program. To address these challenges, we propose HeteroFlow, an FPGA accelerator programming model that decouples the algorithm specification from optimizations related to orchestrating the placement of data across a customized memory hierarchy. Specifically, we introduce a new primitive named .to(), which provides a unified programming interface for specifying data placement optimizations at different levels of granularity: (1) coarse-grained data placement between host and accelerator, (2) medium-grained kernel-level data placement within an accelerator, and (3) fine-grained data placement within a kernel. We build HeteroFlow on top of the open-source HeteroCL DSL and compilation framework. Experimental results on a set of realistic benchmarks show that, programs written in HeteroFlow can match the performance of extensively optimized manual HLS design with much fewer lines of code.",

        "abstract": "The data abuse issue has risen along with the widespread development of the deep learning inference service (DLIS). Specifically, mobile users worry about their input data being labeled to secretly train new deep learning models that are unrelated to the DLIS they subscribe to. This unique issue, unlike the privacy problem, is about the rights of data owners in the context of deep learning. However, preventing data abuse is demanding when considering the usability and generality in the mobile scenario. In this work, we propose, to our best knowledge, the first data abuse prevention mechanism called DAPter. DAPter is a user-side DLIS-input converter, which removes unnecessary information with respect to the targeted DLIS. The converted input data by DAPter maintains good inference accuracy and is difficult to be labeled manually or automatically for the new model training. DAPter’s conversion is empowered by our lightweight generative model trained with a novel loss function to minimize abusable information in the input data. Furthermore, adapting DAPter requires no change in the existing DLIS backend and models. We conduct comprehensive experiments with our DAPter prototype on mobile devices and demonstrate that DAPter can substantially raise the bar of the data abuse difficulty with little impact on the service quality and overhead.",

One possible mechanism for addressing misinformation is social: there is evidence seeing misinformation being challenged can ‘inoculate’ a reader against it. To date, no research has examined how discussions sparked by misinformation play out; What are the different ways in which people reply to posts containing misinformation? How does the discussion flow in each case? Are there differences between platforms? We address these questions through an inductive qualitative analysis of discussion threads on three public discussion platforms (Twitter, YouTube and two news sites) and on three topics (COVID, Brexit and climate change). We present a classification scheme of types of replies to misinformation, and show that replies show different patterns between platforms. Knowing how people reply to posts that contain misinformation enriches our knowledge of ‘human misinformation interaction,’ and provides an understanding of how socio-technical factors in platform design can reduce the risk of misinformation spreading.",

        "abstract": "Low-code application platforms enable citizen developers to autonomously build complete applications, such as web applications or mobile applications. Some of these platforms also offer support for reuse to facilitate the development of similar applications. The offered mechanisms are usually elementary, they allow module reuse or building a new application from a template. However, they are insufficient to achieve the industrial level reuse necessary for software product lines (SPL). In fact, these platforms were conceived to help build standalone applications, not software families and even fewer software product lines. In this paper, we argue that the major limitation is that these platforms seldom provide access to their metamodel, the access to applications’ models and code is also limited and, therefore, makes it harder to analyze commonality and variability and construct models based on it. An approach is proposed to surpass these limitations: firstly, a metamodel of the applications built with the platform is obtained, and then, based on the metamodel, a domain-specific language (DSL) that can express the models of the applications, including variability, is constructed. With this DSL, users can combine and reuse models from different applications to explore and build similar applications. The solution is illustrated with an industrial case study. A discussion of the results is presented as well as its limitations and related work. The authors hope that this work provides inspiration and some ideas that the community can explore to facilitate the adoption and implementation of SPLs in the context, and supported by, low-code platforms.",

In recent years, pervasive RF signals are further exploited for sensing; RF sensing has since attracted attentions from both academia and industry. Existing developments mainly employ commodity Wi-Fi hardware or rely on sophisticated SDR platforms. While promising in many aspects, there still remains a gap between lab prototypes and real-life deployments. On one hand, due to its narrow bandwidth and communication-oriented design, Wi-Fi sensing offers a coarse sensing granularity and its performance is very unstable in harsh real-world environments. On the other hand, SDR-based designs may hardly be adopted in practice due to its large size and high cost. To this end, we propose, design, and implement Octopus, a compact and flexible wideband MIMO sensing platform, built using commercial-grade low-power impulse radio. Octopus provides a standalone and fully programmable RF sensing solution; it allows for quick algorithm design and application development, and it specifically leverages the wideband radio to achieve a competent and robust performance in practice. We evaluate the performance of Octopus via micro-benchmarking, and further demonstrate its applicability using representative RF sensing applications, including passive localization, vibration sensing, and human/object imaging.",

        "abstract": "Historical Islamic ornaments include a fantastic treasury of geometric and mathematical algorithms. Inevitably, restoration of these ornaments in periodic patterns consisting of repeated elements has been faced following and substituting the other available similar ingredients instead of vanished parts. Still, the prediction of parametric, quasi, or non-periodic patterns, where components are not identical, needs to be carried out in a more challenging process than the periodic ones due to shape, scale, or angle of rotation alteration. Intelligent restoration could facilitate the forecasting of damaged parts in such geometric patterns that an algorithm has changed their geometric characteristics. In some architectural heritage, geometric patterns include a parametric algorithm like parametric patterns in the ceiling of Sheikh Lotfollahmosque in Isfahan, Iran, and the dominant structure of Persian domes Karbandi. In this article, the aim is to propose a new method for the smart restoration of the parametric geometric patterns in which, by having access to the image of the existing patterns, the vanished parts could be reconstructed spontaneously. Our approach is based on image processing by detecting boundaries of deterioration, finding every individual element, and extracting features of detected individual patterns via Zernike moments. The order of individual patterns starts from the farthest pattern to detected deterioration. Then by creating a time series, the Back-propagation neural network would be trained by extracted features, and the vanished patterns’ features could be predicted and reconstructed. Eventually, the reconstructed and real patterns are compared to determine differences between them by mean-squared error and to evaluate the performance of our method. To validate the process, a parametric geometric pattern is designed by the assumption that some parts are disappeared. The proposed method’s results, in this case, hold an efficient performance with the accuracy of 92.99%. Furthermore, Sheikh Lotfollah’s patterns and Naseredin Mirza mansion’s patterns as two real cases are tested by the proposed method, representing reliable and suitable performance results.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted in various privacy-critical applications, e.g., face recognition and medical image analysis. However, recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to attacks against their training data. Membership inference is one major attack in this domain: Given a data sample and model, an adversary aims to determine whether the sample is part of the model's training set. Existing membership inference attacks leverage the confidence scores returned by the model as their inputs (score-based attacks). However, these attacks can be easily mitigated if the model only exposes the predicted label, i.e., the final model decision. In this paper, we propose decision-based membership inference attacks and demonstrate that label-only exposures are also vulnerable to membership leakage. In particular, we develop two types of decision-based attacks, namely transfer attack and boundary attack. Empirical evaluation shows that our decision-based attacks can achieve remarkable performance, and even outperform the previous score-based attacks in some cases. We further present new insights on the success of membership inference based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, i.e., member samples of a model are more distant to the model's decision boundary than non-member samples. Finally, we evaluate multiple defense mechanisms against our decision-based attacks and show that our two types of attacks can bypass most of these defenses.",

The overall objective is then to produce code embeddings that capture the maximum of program semantics. State-of-the-art approaches invariably rely on a syntactic representation (i.e., raw lexical tokens, abstract syntax trees, or intermediate representation tokens) to generate embeddings, which are criticized in the literature as non-robust or non-generalizable. In this work, we investigate a novel embedding approach based on the intuition that source code has visual patterns of semantics. We further use these patterns to address the outstanding challenge of identifying semantic code clones. We propose the WySiWiM (‘‘What You See Is What It Means”) approach where visual representations of source code are fed into powerful pre-trained image classification neural networks from the field of computer vision to benefit from the practical advantages of transfer learning. We evaluate the proposed embedding approach on the task of vulnerable code prediction in source code and on two variations of the task of semantic code clone identification: code clone detection (a binary classification problem), and code classification (a multi-classification problem). We show with experiments on the BigCloneBench (Java), Open Judge (C) that although simple, our WySiWiM  approach performs as effectively as state-of-the-art approaches such as ASTNN or TBCNN. We also showed with data from NVD and SARD that WySiWiM  representation can be used to learn a vulnerable code detector with reasonable performance (accuracy ∼90%). We further explore the influence of different steps in our approach, such as the choice of visual representations or the classification algorithm, to eventually discuss the promises and limitations of this research direction.",

We discuss our experiences developing Modin, our first cut at a parallel dataframe system, which already has users across several industries and over 1M downloads. Modin translates pandas functions into a core set of operators that are individually parallelized via columnar, row-wise, or cell-wise decomposition rules that we formalize in this paper. We also introduce metadata independence to allow metadata---such as order and type---to be decoupled from the physical representation and maintained lazily. Using rule-based decomposition and metadata independence, along with careful engineering, Modin is able to support pandas operations across both rows and columns on very large dataframes---unlike Koalas and Dask DataFrames that either break down or are unable to support such operations, while also being much faster than pandas.",

First, the input is processed and the KnitNet data structure is generated. This graph structure serves as an abstract interface between the high-level geometric and knitting configuration and the low-level, machine-specific knitting instructions. Second, a graph rewriting procedure is applied on the KnitNet that produces a sequence of abstract machine actions. Finally, the low-level machine instructions are generated by adapting those abstract actions to a specific machine context. We showcase the potential of this computational approach by designing and fabricating a variety of objects with complex geometries, multiple yarns, and multiple stitch patterns.",

        "abstract": "For compute-intensive iterative queries over a streaming graph, it is critical to evaluate the queries continuously and incrementally for best efficiency. However, the existing incremental graph processing requires a priori knowledge of the query (e.g., the source vertex of a vertex-specific query); otherwise, it has to fall back to the expensive full evaluation that starts from scratch. To alleviate this restriction, this work presents a principled solution to generalizing the incremental graph processing, such that queries, without their a priori knowledge, can also be evaluated incrementally. The solution centers around the concept of graph triangle inequalities, an idea inspired by the classical triangle inequality principle in the Euclidean space. Interestingly, similar principles can also be derived for many vertex-specific graph problems. These principles can help establish rigorous constraints between the evaluation of one graph query and the results of another, thus enabling reusing the latter to accelerate the former. Based on this finding, a novel streaming graph system, called Tripoline, is built which enables incremental evaluation of queries without their a priori knowledge. Built on top of a state-of-the-art shared-memory streaming graph engine (Aspen), Tripoline natively supports high-throughput low-cost graph updates. A systematic evaluation with a set of eight vertex-specific graph problems and four real-world large graphs confirms both the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and the efficiency of Tripoline.",

Simurgh guarantees consistency, durability, and ordering of updates without sacrificing scalability. Security is enforced by only allowing NVMM access from protected user space functions, which can be implemented through two proposed instructions.

We present heap fragments as a general technique to allow these theories to reason about recursion in a general and robust way.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the results of an ethnographic study focusing on food deliveries for the digital platform Wolt. The platform manages food transport ordered by customers to be delivered at home from restaurants, and subcontracts the transport to workers called 'couriers', who act as independent firms or entrepreneurs. The paper is based on six months of participant observation, during which time the first author worked as a courier, as well as on ad-hoc conversations and semi-structured interviews with other couriers. We describe couriers' work for the platform and discuss our findings using Möhlmann and Zalmanson's definition of algorithmic management. We found both similarities and differences. It was noticeable that the couriers were positive about their work that no penalties or wage reductions were enforced, and that human support complemented the platform's algorithmic management. Thus, the algorithmic management we observed is neither harsh (as it has been described on other platforms including Uber), nor like the algorithmic despotism present on Instacart, for example. Hence, we refer to it as 'lenient algorithmic management' and underline the importance of adding new perspectives to our understanding of what algorithmic management can be, as well as looking at the context in which it is practised. To complement this finding of lenient algorithmic management, we present a set of strategies couriers must engage in to be effective on the platform: Thus, couriers must 1) schedule their work for peak hours to limit the amount of time they waste, 2) bundle orders to increase their payment per tour, 3) make use of support to handle customers and cancel orders involving delays, and 4) make use of the ecology of local support structures. The contribution of this paper is to add new perspectives to the way we perceive algorithmic management by presenting a lenient form of algorithmic management and indicating the importance of looking at the context in which it is practised, while describing what it takes to be an effective worker on the Wolt platform.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has become a crucial component in software products, either as part of the user experience or used internally by software teams. Prior studies have explored how ML is affecting development team roles beyond data scientists, including user experience designers, program managers, developers and operations engineers. However, there has been little investigation of how team members in different roles on the team communicate about ML, in particular about the quality of models. We use the general term quality to look beyond technical issues of model evaluation, such as accuracy and overfitting, to any issue affecting whether a model is suitable for use, including ethical, engineering, operations, and legal considerations. What challenges do teams face in discussing the quality of ML models? What work practices mitigate those challenges? To address these questions, we conducted a mixed-methods study at a large software company, first interviewing15 employees in a variety of roles, then surveying 168 employees to broaden our understanding. We found several challenges, including a mismatch between user-focused and model-focused notions of performance, misunderstandings about the capabilities and limitations of evolving ML technology, and difficulties in understanding concerns beyond one's own role. We found several mitigation strategies, including the use of demos during discussions to keep the team customer-focused.",

We introduce Unikraft, a novel micro-library OS that (1) fully modularizes OS primitives so that it is easy to customize the unikernel and include only relevant components and (2) exposes a set of composable, performance-oriented APIs in order to make it easy for developers to obtain high performance. Our evaluation using off-the-shelf applications such as nginx, SQLite, and Redis shows that running them on Unikraft results in a 1.7x-2.7x performance improvement compared to Linux guests. In addition, Unikraft images for these apps are around 1MB, require less than 10MB of RAM to run, and boot in around 1ms on top of the VMM time (total boot time 3ms-40ms). Unikraft is a Linux Foundation open source project and can be found at www.unikraft.org.",

They are a significant threat to Internet privacy since simply visiting a web page may reveal if the victim is a drug addict or leak a sexual orientation. Numerous different attack vectors, as well as mitigation strategies, have been proposed, but a clear and systematic understanding of XS-Leak' root causes is still missing. Recently, Sudhodanan et al. gave a first overview of XS-Leak at NDSS 2020. We build on their work by presenting the first formal model for XS-Leaks. Our comprehensive analysis of known XS-Leaks reveals that all of them fit into this new model. With the help of this formal approach, we (1) systematically searched for new XS-Leak attack classes, (2) implemented XSinator.com, a tool to automatically evaluate if a given web browser is vulnerable to XS-Leaks, and (3) systematically evaluated mitigations for XS-Leaks. We found 14 new attack classes, evaluated the resilience of 56 different browser/OS combinations against a total of 34 XS-Leaks, and propose a completely novel methodology to mitigate XS-Leaks.",

While remote work has received much scholarly and public attention over the years, we still know little about how people with disabilities engage in remote work from their homes and what access means in this context. To understand and rethink accessibility in remote work, the present paper studies work-from-home practices of neurodivergent professionals who have Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia) and psychosocial disabilities (e.g., anxiety, depression). We report on interviews with 36 US-based neurodivergent professionals who have been working from home during the pandemic. Our findings reveal that while working from home, neurodivergent professionals create accessible physical and digital workspaces, negotiate accessible communication practices, and reconcile tensions between productivity and wellbeing. Our analysis reconsiders what access means in remote work for neurodivergent professionals and offers practical insights for inclusive work practices and accessibility improvements in remote collaboration tools.",

        "abstract": "Even in the turn toward justice-oriented pedagogy, computing education tends to overlook the quality of intergroup relationships, which risks entrenching division. In this article, we establish an intercultural approach to computing education, informed by intercultural and peace education, prejudice reduction, and the sociology of racism and ethnicity. We outline three major concerns of intercultural computing: shifting from content toward relationships, from cultural responsiveness to cultural reflexivity, and from identity to identification. For the last, we complicate discourses of race and identity widespread in U.S. education. Drawing from studies of youth programming classes in East Africa and U.S. contexts, we then reflect on our attempts to address the first shift of fostering relationships across difference. We highlight three promising design tactics: intergroup pairing, interdependent programming, and making relational goals explicit. Overall, we find that computing can indeed be a site of intergroup bonding across difference, but that bonding can carry complications and tensions with other equity goals and tactics. Rather than framing justice-oriented CS primarily as changes to the aims of computational learning, we argue that future work should explore making relational goals explicit and teach students how to attend to friction.",

This article presents an in-depth field study of a large-scale Agile transformation in a mission-critical environment, where stakeholders’ commitment was a critical success factor. The goal of such a transformation was to implement mission-oriented features, reducing costs and time to operate in critical scenarios. The project lasted several years and involved over 40 professionals. We report how a hierarchical and plan-driven organization exploited Agile methods to develop a Command & Control (C2) system. Accordingly, we first abstract our experience, inducing a success model of general use for other comparable organizations by performing a post-mortem study. The goal of the inductive research process was to identify critical success factors and their relations. Finally, we validated and generalized our model through Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling, surveying 200 software engineers involved in similar projects. We conclude the article with data-driven recommendations concerning the management of Agile projects.",

        "abstract": "The large variety of compute-heavy and data-driven applications accelerate the need for a distributed I/O solution that enables cost-effective scaling of resources between networked hosts. For example, in a cluster system, different machines may have various devices available at different times, but moving workloads to remote units over the network is often costly and introduces large overheads compared to accessing local resources. To facilitate I/O disaggregation and device sharing among hosts connected using Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) non-transparent bridges, we present SmartIO. NVMes, GPUs, network adapters, or any other standard PCIe device may be borrowed and accessed directly, as if they were local to the remote machines. We provide capabilities beyond existing disaggregation solutions by combining traditional I/O with distributed shared-memory functionality, allowing devices to become part of the same global address space as cluster applications. Software is entirely removed from the data path, and simultaneous sharing of a device among application processes running on remote hosts is enabled. Our experimental results show that I/O devices can be shared with remote hosts, achieving native PCIe performance. Thus, compared to existing device distribution mechanisms, SmartIO provides more efficient, low-cost resource sharing, increasing the overall system performance.",

Drawing on two cases, the analysis shows the ways in which digital technologies oftentimes overshadow communities' key concerns for care, and how attempts to design for community settings can result in anti-designs, that is sociotechnical configurations that can disrupt caring practices. The contribution of the paper is twofold: first, an analysis of the different configurations of caring and efficiency and, second, a focus on care in the design and appropriation of technologies into this space.",

This paper dwells on the affects of tech workers facing critique and scrutiny. Through this approach, we find that emotional habitus conditions the possibilities of personal and political action and inaction in response to critique. By emotional habitus, we refer to the emotional dispositions honed among tech workers by tech culture's rationality and optimism. This habitus must shift if people are to access new ways of relating and acting. We argue for more fruitful attitudes and practices in relation to critique.",

With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), live video analytics are enabling various useful services, including traffic monitoring and campus surveillance.

In this paper, we envision a full-fledged system for software-defined video analytics with cross-camera collaboration that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. We illustrate its detailed system architecture, carefully analyze the key system requirements with representative app scenarios, and derive potential research issues along with a summary of the status quo of existing works.",

        "abstract": "The HTTP adaptive streaming technique opened the door to cope with the fluctuating network conditions during the streaming process by dynamically adjusting the volume of the future chunks to be downloaded. The bitrate selection in this adjustment inevitably involves the task of predicting the future throughput of a video session, owing to which various heuristic solutions have been explored. The ultimate goal of the present work is to explore the theoretical upper bounds of the QoE that any ABR algorithm can possibly reach, therefore providing an essential step to benchmarking the performance evaluation of ABR algorithms. In our setting, the QoE is defined in terms of a linear combination of the average perceptual quality and the buffering ratio. The optimization problem is proven to be NP-hard when the perceptual quality is defined by chunk size and conditions are given under which the problem becomes polynomially solvable. Enriched by a global lower bound, a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm along the dynamic programming approach is presented. When the minimum buffering is given higher priority over higher perceptual quality, the problem is shown to be also NP-hard, and the above algorithm is simplified and enhanced by a sequence of lower bounds on the completion time of chunk downloading, which, according to our experiment, brings a 36.0% performance improvement in terms of computation time. To handle large amounts of data more efficiently, a polynomial-time algorithm is also introduced to approximate the optimal values when minimum buffering is prioritized. Besides its performance guarantee, this algorithm is shown to reach 99.938% close to the optimal results, while taking only 0.024% of the computation time compared to the exact algorithm in dynamic programming.",
