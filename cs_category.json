        "abstract": "The shutdown measures necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19 have amplified the role of technology in intimate partner violence (IPV). Survivors may be forced to endure lockdowns with their abusers, intensifying the dangers of technology-enabled abuse (e.g. stalking, harassment, monitoring, surveillance). They may also be forced to rely on potentially compromised devices to reach support networks: a dangerous dilemma for digital safety. This qualitative study examines how technologists with computer security expertise provided remote assistance to IPV survivors during the pandemic. Findings from 24 consults with survivors and five focus groups with technologist consultants show how remote delivery of technology support services raised three fundamental challenges: (1) ensuring safety for survivors and consultants; (2) assessing device security over a remote connection; and (3) navigating new burdens for consultants, including emotional labor. We highlight implications for HCI researchers creating systems that enable access to remote expert services for vulnerable people.",

The market is providing various consumer-oriented smart IoT devices; the mainstream cloud service providers are building their software stacks to support IoT services. With this emerging trend even growing, the security of such smart IoT cloud systems has drawn much research attention in recent years. To better understand the emerging consumer-oriented smart IoT cloud systems for practical engineers and new researchers, this article presents a review of the most recent research efforts on existing, real, already deployed consumer-oriented IoT cloud applications in the past five years using typical case studies. Specifically, we first present a general model for the IoT cloud ecosystem. Then, using the model, we review and summarize recent, representative research works on emerging smart IoT cloud system security using 10 detailed case studies, with the aim that the case studies together provide insights into the insecurity of current emerging IoT cloud systems. We further present a systematic approach to conduct a security analysis for IoT cloud systems. Based on the proposed security analysis approach, we review and suggest potential security risk mitigation methods to protect IoT cloud systems. We also discuss future research challenges for the IoT cloud security area.",

        "abstract": "As of January 2021 there are 4.66 billion active internet users worldwide [39]. Moreover, during the COVID-19 lock downs, people's online traffic increased significantly, to the extent that many are still doing their shopping, banking, learning, working, exercise, entertainment and even socialising online. In this increasingly digital existence, the security issue cannot be ignored especially internet security. As more of users daily tasks are performed online, people's mobile phone, laptop, and tablet interfaces have become extensions of themselves and it is crucial that these afford and support a user in remaining secure. To ensure this, the research proposes that the everyday user needs to be able to engage and use the security driven mechanisms on these devices and applications (i.e. warnings and cautions). However, in reality many users often ignore and discard online warning and caution signs. This paper will introduce plans for some future research that will explore aesthetics for the design of a new body of online security warning and cautions. Like in the physical world, the aim is to ensure that people are equipped with effective warning and caution signs to protect them as they go about their day to day online tasks. Making future design suggestions for not just usable and secure but also engaging online warnings, the research proposes to open up an entirely new avenue of study around usable security aesthetics.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we provide the first comprehensive study of user-chosen four- and six-digit PINs (n=1705) collected on smartphones with participants being explicitly primed for device unlocking. We find that against a throttled attacker (with 10, 30, or 100 guesses, matching the smartphone unlock setting), using six-digit PINs instead of four-digit PINs provides little to no increase in security and surprisingly may even decrease security. We also study the effects of blocklists, where a set of “easy to guess” PINs is disallowed during selection. Two such blocklists are in use today by iOS, for four digits (274 PINs) as well as six digits (2,910 PINs). We extracted both blocklists and compared them with six other blocklists, three for each PIN length. In each case, we had a small (four-digit: 27 PINs; six-digit: 29 PINs), a large (four-digit: 2,740 PINs; six-digit: 291,000 PINs), and a placebo blocklist that always excluded the first-choice PIN. For four-digit PINs, we find that the relatively small blocklist in use today by iOS offers little to no benefit against a throttled guessing attack. Security gains are only observed when the blocklist is much larger. In the six-digit case, we were able to reach a similar security level with a smaller blocklist. As the user frustration increases with the blocklists size, developers should employ a blocklist that is as small as possible while ensuring the desired security. Based on our analysis, we recommend that for four-digit PINs a blocklist should contain the 1,000 most popular PINs to provide the best balance between usability and security and for six-digit PINs the 2,000 most popular PINs should be blocked.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computing is rapidly shifting from high-tech lab to mainstream commercial use in the next few years, representing the next breakthrough in modern ICT. It is motivated by quantum computer's ability to perform computational tasks with efficiencies that are not possible with classical computers. Quantum computing technology has a lasting potential impact on society and broad implications on many aspects of our lives. Although quantum computing has several advantages, it threatens the security of current cryptographic techniques. It is expected that quantum computers will be able to solve the key distribution problem and break every single cryptography and authentication algorithm based on asymmetric cryptography. New emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, 5G, artificial intelligence and robotics all rely on cryptography for their secure operation. Therefore, the realisation of quantum computing will pose significant challenges to the current progress and future development of these technologies. In this paper, the quantum technology preliminaries are discussed. The possible impact of quantum technologies on emerging technologies is investigated. Finally, some of the currently available quantum-safe cryptosystems devoted to protecting computer systems in the quantum era are discussed.",

These tools typically use rule-based approaches to scan source code for security vulnerabilities. However, due to the significant shortcomings of these tools (i.e., high false positive rates), learning-based approaches for Software Vulnerability Prediction (SVP) are becoming a popular approach. Aims: Despite the similar objectives of these two approaches, their comparative value is unexplored. We provide an empirical analysis of SAST tools and SVP models, to identify their relative capabilities for source code security analysis. Method: We evaluate the detection and assessment performance of several common SAST tools and SVP models on a variety of vulnerability datasets. We further assess the viability and potential benefits of combining the two approaches. Results: SAST tools and SVP models provide similar detection capabilities, but SVP models exhibit better overall performance for both detection and assessment. Unification of the two approaches is difficult due to lacking synergies. Conclusions: Our study generates 12 main findings which provide insights into the capabilities and synergy of these two approaches. Through these observations we provide recommendations for use and improvement.",

        "abstract": "Despite the availability of various methods and tools to facilitate secure coding, developers continue to write code that contains common vulnerabilities. It is important to understand why technological advances do not sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure code. To widen our understanding of developers' behaviour, we considered the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory from cognitive and social psychology. Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps. Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors. Interventions will be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication, psychological frameworks, and usability. Our analysis suggests “adaptive security interventions” as a solution that responds to the changing security needs of individual developers and a present a proof-of-concept tool to substantiate our suggestion.",

By analyzing telemetry data from many clients these services are able to offer enhanced insights, identifying global trends and spotting threats before they reach most customers. Unfortunately, the aggregation that drives these insights simultaneously risks exposing sensitive client data if it is not properly sanitized and tracked. In this work, we present SCIFFS, an automated information flow monitoring framework for preventing sensitive data exposure in third-party security analytics platforms. SCIFFS performs decentralized information flow control over customer data it in a serverless setting, leveraging the innate polyinstantiated nature of serverless functions to assure precise and lightweight tracking of data flows. Evaluating SCIFFS against a proof-of-concept security analytics framework on the widely-used OpenFaaS platform, we demonstrate that our solution supports common analyst workflows data ingestion, custom dashboards, threat hunting) while imposing just 3.87% runtime overhead on event ingestion and the overhead on aggregation queries grows linearly with the number of records in the database (e.g., 18.75% for 50,000 records and 104.27% for 500,000 records) as compared to an insecure baseline. Thus, SCIFFS not only establishes a privacy-respecting model for third-party security analytics, but also highlights the opportunities for security-sensitive applications in the serverless computing model.",

These tools are mainly evaluated in terms of their accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, but the evaluation of their usability is a commonly neglected topic. Usability of automated security tools is particularly crucial when dealing with problems of cryptographic protocols for which even small—apparently insignificant—changes in their configuration can result in vulnerabilities that, if exploited, pave the way to attacks with dramatic consequences for the confidentiality and integrity of exchanged messages. This becomes even more acute when considering such ubiquitous protocols as the one for Transport Layer Security (TLS for short). In this paper, we present the design and the lessons learned of a user study, meant to compare two different approaches when reporting misconfigurations. Results reveal that including contextualized actionable mitigations in security reports significantly impact the accuracy and the time needed to patch TLS vulnerabilities. Along with the lessons learned, we share the experimental material that can be used during cybersecurity labs to let students configure and patch TLS first-hand.",

Through all the eleven years of running the software security course, the course objectives have been comprehensive - ranging from security testing, to secure design and coding, to security requirements to security risk management. For the first time in this eleventh year, a theme of the course assignments was to map vulnerability discovery to the security controls of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). Based upon student performance on a final exploratory penetration testing project, this mapping may have increased students' depth of understanding of a wider range of security topics. The students efficiently detected 191 unique and verified vulnerabilities of 28 different Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types during a three-hour period in the OpenMRS project, an electronic health record application in active use.",

        "abstract": "The technologies for real-time multimedia transmission and immersive 3D gaming applications are rapidly emerging, posing challenges in terms of performance, security, authentication, data privacy, and encoding. The communication channel for these multimedia applications must be secure and reliable from network attack vectors and data-contents must employ strong encryption to preserve privacy and confidentiality. Towards delivering secure multimedia application environment for 5G networks, we propose an SDN/NFV (Software-Defined-Networking/Network-Function-Virtualization) framework called STREK, which attempts to deliver highly adaptable Quality-of-Experience (QoE), Security, and Authentication functions for multi-domain Cloud to Edge networks. The STREK architecture consists of a holistic SDNFV dataplane, NFV service-chaining and network slicing, a lightweight adaptable hybrid cipher scheme called TREK, and an open RESTful API for applications to deploy custom policies at runtime for multimedia services. For multi-domain/small-cell deployments, the key-generation scheme is dynamic at flow/session-level, and the handover authentication scheme uses a novel method to exchange security credentials with the Access Points (APs) of neighborhood cells. This scheme is designed to improve authentication function during handover with low overhead, delivering the 5G ultra-low latency requirements. We present the experiments with both software and hardware-based implementations and compare our solution with popular lightweight cryptographic solutions, standard open source software, and SDN-based research proposals for 5G multimedia. In the microbenchmarks, STREK achieves smaller hardware, low overhead, low computation, higher attack resistance, and offers better network performance for multimedia streaming applications. In real-time multimedia use-cases, STREK shows greater level of quality distortion for multimedia contents with minimal encryption bitrate overhead to deliver data confidentiality, immunity to common cryptanalysis, and significant resistance to communication channel attacks, in the context of low-latency 5G networks.",

        "abstract": "Isolated execution is a concept commonly used for increasing the security of a computer system. In the embedded world, ARM TrustZone technology enables this goal and is currently used on mobile devices for applications such as secure payment or biometric authentication. In this work, we investigate the security benefits achievable through the usage of ARM TrustZone on FPGA-SoCs. We first adapt Microsoft’s implementation of a firmware Trusted Platform Module (fTPM) running inside ARM TrustZone for the Zynq UltraScale+ platform. This adaptation consists in integrating hardware accelerators available on the device to fTPM’s implementation and to enhance fTPM with an entropy source derived from on-chip SRAM start-up patterns. With our approach, we transform a software implementation of a TPM into a hybrid hardware/software design that could address some of the security drawbacks of the original implementation while keeping its flexibility. To demonstrate the security gains obtained via the usage of ARM TrustZone and our hybrid-TPM on FPGA-SoCs, we propose a framework that combines them for enabling a secure remote bitstream loading. The approach consists in preventing the insecure usages of a bitstream reconfiguration interface that are made possible by the manufacturer and to integrate the interface inside a Trusted Execution Environment.",

        "abstract": "Google Search is where most developers start their Web journey looking for code examples to reuse. It is highly likely that code that is linked to the top results will be among those candidates that find their way into production software. However, as a large amount of secure and insecure code has been identified on the Web, the question arises how the providing webpages are ranked by Google and whether the ranking has an effect on software security. We investigate how secure and insecure cryptographic code examples from Stack Overflow are ranked by Google Search. Our results show that insecure code ends up in the top results and is clicked on more often. There is at least a 22.8% chance that one out of the top three Google Search results leads to insecure code. We introduce security-based re-ranking, where the rank of Google Search is updated based on the security and relevance of the provided source code in the results. We tested our re-ranking approach and compared it to Google's original ranking in an online developer study. Participants that used our modified search engine to look for help online submitted more secure and functional results, with statistical significance. In contrast to prior work on helping developers to write secure code, security-based re-ranking completely eradicates the requirement for any action performed by developers. Our intervention remains completely invisible, and therefore the probability of adoption is greatly increased. We believe security-based re-ranking allows Internet-wide improvement of code security and prevents the far-reaching spread of insecure code found on the Web.",

        "abstract": "As the complexity of software applications increases, there has been a growing demand for intra-process memory isolation. The commercially available intra-process memory isolation mechanisms in modern processors, e.g., Intel’s memory protection keys, trade-off between efficiency and security guarantees. Recently, researchers have tended to leverage the features with low security guarantees for intra-process memory isolation. Subsequently, they have relied on binary scanning and runtime binary rewriting to prevent the execution of unsafe instructions, which improves the security guarantees. Such intra-process memory isolation mechanisms are not the only security solutions that have to prevent the execution of unsafe instructions in untrusted parts of the code. In fact, we identify a similar requirement in a variety of other security solutions. Although binary scanning and runtime binary rewriting approaches can be leveraged to address this requirement, it is challenging to efficiently implement these approaches.  In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible hardware-assisted feature for runtime filtering of user-specified instructions. This flexible feature, called FlexFilt, assists with securing various isolation-based mechanisms. FlexFilt enables the software developer to create up to 16 instruction domains, where each instruction domain can be configured to filter the execution of user-specified instructions. In addition to filtering unprivileged instructions, FlexFilt is capable of filtering privileged instructions. To illustrate the effectiveness of FlexFilt compared to binary scanning approaches, we measure the overhead caused by scanning the JIT compiled code while browsing various webpages. We demonstrate the feasibility of FlexFilt by implementing our design on the RISC-V Rocket core, providing the Linux kernel support for it, and prototyping our full design on an FPGA.",

The present work constructs the intelligent prevention system of infectious diseases based on edge computing by using the edge computing algorithm, and further deploys and optimizes the privacy information security defense strategy of users in the system, controls the cost, constructs the optimal conditions of the system security defense, and finally analyzes the performance of the model. The results show that the system delay decreases with the increase of power in the downlink. In the analysis of the security performance of personal privacy information, it is found that six different nodes can maintain the optimal strategy when the cost is minimized in the finite time domain and infinite time domain. In comparison with other classical algorithms in the communication field, when the intelligent prevention system of infectious diseases constructed adopts the best defense strategy, it can effectively reduce the consumption of computing resources of edge network equipment, and the prediction accuracy is obviously better than that of other algorithms, reaching 83%. Hence, the results demonstrate that the model constructed can ensure the safety performance and forecast accuracy, and achieve the best defense strategy at low cost, which provides experimental reference for the prevention and detection of infectious diseases in the later period.",

        "abstract": "Background: Automated unit and integration tests allow software development teams to continuously evaluate their application's behavior and ensure requirements are satisfied. Interest in explicitly testing security at the unit and integration levels has risen as more teams begin to shift security left in their workflows, but there is little insight into any potential pain points developers may experience as they learn to adapt their existing skills to write these tests. Aims: Identify security unit and integration testing pain points that could negatively impact efforts to shift security (testing) left to this level. Method: An mixed-method empirical study was conducted on 525 Stack Overflow and Security Stack Exchange posts related to security unit and integration testing. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to identify commonly discussed topics, pain points were learned through qualitative analysis, and links were analyzed to study commonly-shared resources. Results: Nine topics representing security controls, components, and scenarios were identified; Authentication was the most commonly tested control. Developers experienced seven pain points unique to security unit and integration testing, which were all influenced by the complexity of security control designs and implementations. Most linked resources were other Q&A posts, but repositories and documentation for security tools and libraries were also common. Conclusions: Developers may experience several unique pain points when writing tests at this level involving security controls. Additional resources are needed to guide developers through these challenges, which should also influence the creation of strategies and tools to help shift security testing to this level. To accelerate this, actionable recommendations for practitioners and future research directions based on these findings are highlighted.",

The interconnectivity and mobility brought by IoT devices led to extremely variable networks, as well as unpredictable information flows. In turn, security proved to be a serious issue for the IoT, far more serious than it has been in the past for other technologies. We claim that IoT devices need detailed descriptions of their behaviour to achieve secure default configurations, sufficient security configurability, and self-configurability. In this article, we propose S×C4IoT, a framework that addresses these issues by combining two paradigms: Security by Contract (S×C) and Fog computing. First, we summarise the necessary background such as the basic S×C definitions. Then, we describe how devices interact within S×C4IoT and how our framework manages the dynamic evolution that naturally result from IoT devices life-cycles. Furthermore, we show that S×C4IoT can allow legacy S×C-noncompliant devices to participate with an S×C network, we illustrate two different integration approaches, and we show how they fit into S×C4IoT. Last, we implement the framework as a proof-of-concept. We show the feasibility of S×C4IoT and we run different experiments to evaluate its impact in terms of communication and storage space overhead.",

Objective research on industry use of software security practices is needed to help development teams, academic researchers, and educators to focus their activities.   Since 2008, a team of researchers, including two of the authors, has been gathering objective data on the use of 121 software security activities. The Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) study explores the activity use of 675,000 software developers, in companies including some of the world’s largest and most security-focused.   Our analysis of the study data shows little consistent growth in security activity adoption industry-wide until 2015. Since then, the data shows a strong increasing trend, along with the adoption of new activities to support cloud-based deployment, an emphasis on component security, and a reduction in security professionals’ policing role. Exploring patterns of adoption, activities related to detecting and responding to vulnerabilities are adopted marginally earlier than activities related to preventing vulnerabilities; and activities related to particular job roles tend to be used together. We also found that 12 developer security activities are adopted early, together, and notably more often than any others.   From these results, we offer recommendations for software and security engineers, and corresponding education and research suggestions for academia. These recommendations offer a strong contribution to improving security in development teams in the future.",

Organizational Psychology offers the paradigm Intentional Forgetting (IF) and associated tools for replacing old (insecure) behaviors with new (secure) ones by identifying and eliminating different cues (sensoric, routine-based, time and space based as well as situational strength cues) that trigger old behavior.

The model needs to strike a difficult balance between security, privacy, and usability for end users, assurances for app developers, and system performance under tight hardware constraints. While many of the underlying design principles have implicitly informed the overall system architecture, access control mechanisms, and mitigation techniques, the Android security model has previously not been formally published. This article aims to both document the abstract model and discuss its implications. Based on a definition of the threat model and Android ecosystem context in which it operates, we analyze how the different security measures in past and current Android implementations work together to mitigate these threats. There are some special cases in applying the security model, and we discuss such deliberate deviations from the abstract model.",

Researchers and practitioners have paid attention to the security vulnerabilities of SGX and investigated optimization solutions in real applications. Unfortunately, existing literature lacks a thorough review of security vulnerabilities of SGX and their countermeasures. In this article, we fill this gap. Specifically, we propose two sets of criteria for estimating security risks of existing attacks and evaluating defense effects brought by attack countermeasures. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy of SGX security vulnerabilities and shed light on corresponding attack vectors. After that, we review published attacks and existing countermeasures, as well as evaluate them by employing our proposed criteria.

However, despite practicing mandatory code reviews, many Open Source Software (OSS) projects still encounter a large number of post-release security vulnerabilities, as some security defects escape those. Therefore, a project manager may wonder if there was any weakness or inconsistency during a code review that missed a security vulnerability. Answers to this question may help a manager pinpointing areas of concern and taking measures to improve the effectiveness of his/her project's code reviews in identifying security defects. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors that differentiate code reviews that successfully identified security defects from those that missed such defects. With this goal, we conduct a case-control study of Chromium OS project. Using multi-stage semi-automated approaches, we build a dataset of 516 code reviews that successfully identified security defects and 374 code reviews where security defects escaped. The results of our empirical study suggest that the are significant differences between the categories of security defects that are identified and that are missed during code reviews. A logistic regression model fitted on our dataset achieved an AUC score of 0.91 and has identified nine code review attributes that influence identifications of security defects. While time to complete a review, the number of mutual reviews between two developers, and if the review is for a bug fix have positive impacts on vulnerability identification, opposite effects are observed from the number of directories under review, the number of total reviews by a developer, and the total number of prior commits for the file under review.",

In this work, we construct and examine a proof-of-concept prototype of such a system of systems, which consists of heterogeneous commercial off-the-shelf components, and utilises diverse communication protocols. We recognise the inherent need for lightweight security in this context, and address it by employing a low-cost state-of-the-art security solution. Our solution is based on a novel hardware and software co-engineering paradigm, utilising well-known software-based cryptographic algorithms, in order to maximise the security potential of the hardware security primitive (a Physical Unclonable Function) that is used as a security anchor. The performance of the proposed security solution is evaluated, proving its suitability even for real-time applications. Additionally, the Dolev-Yao attacker model is considered in order to assess the resilience of our solution towards attacks against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the examined system of systems. In this way, it is confirmed that the proposed solution is able to address the emerging security challenges of the oncoming era of systems of systems.",

For designing security measures that can be used in software development, we must understand the obstacles that prevent the adoption of secure software development practices. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed security efforts and constraints of software development projects through an online survey of software development professionals in the US and Japan (N=664). We revealed how certain characteristics of a development project, such as the project’s contractual relationships or the software’s target users, influence security efforts and constraints. In addition, by comparing the survey results of two groups (developers and managers), we revealed how the gap in their security efforts and constraints influences software security. We believe the results provide insights toward designing usable measures to assist security-related decision-making in software development and conducting appropriate surveys targeting software development professionals.",

As a result, the users’ needs and values are not sufficiently addressed, which has implications on security usability. In this paper, we report our lessons learned from applying a user-centered security design process to a well-understood security usability challenge, namely key authentication in secure instant messaging. Users rarely perform these key authentication ceremonies, which makes their end-to-end encrypted communication vulnerable. Our approach includes collaborative design workshops, an expert evaluation, iterative storyboard prototyping, and an online evaluation.  While we could not demonstrate that our design approach resulted in improved usability or user experience, we found that user-centered prototypes can increase the users’ comprehension of security implications. Hence, prototypes based on users’ intuitions, needs, and values are useful starting points for approaching long-standing security challenges. Applying complementary design approaches may improve usability and user experience further.",

        "abstract": "Improving the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for users of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the key to the widespread promotion and deployment of this technology. Network latency is an important factor affecting users' network experience. Due to the limited processing capacity of a single device node of CPS, the communication relationship between equipment is extremely complicated, and multi-hop device nodes may be passed through in the middle, so designing an efficient routing scheme for CPS is a serious challenge. CPS routing also faces a security crisis. System nodes may send viruses or erroneous results to user equipment, and user equipment may also refuse to pay for routing services to system nodes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a secure routing scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is used to ensure secure transactions between system nodes and user equipment. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is used, and two deep neural networks are used to train intelligent agent to achieve low-latency adaptive traffic scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed autonomous routing technology can reduce the system communication latency by about 31.7%-45.4%.",

        "abstract": "The number of citations attracted by publications is a key criteria for measuring their success. To avoid discriminating newer research, such a metric is usually measured in average yearly citations. Understanding and characterizing how citations behave have been prime research topics, yet investigations targeting the cybersecurity domain seem to be particularly scarce. In this perspective, the paper aims at filling this gap by analyzing average yearly citations for 6,693 papers published in top-tier conferences and journals in cybersecurity. Results indicate the existence of three clusters, i.e., general security conferences, general security journals, and cryptography-centered publications. The analysis also suggests that the amount of conference-to-conference citations stands out compared to journal-to-journal and conference-to-journal citations. Besides, papers published at top conferences attract more citations although a direct comparison against other venues is not straightforward. To better quantify the impact of works dealing with cybersecurity aspects, the paper introduces two new metrics, namely the number of main words in the title, and the combined number of unique main words in title, abstract and keywords. Collected results show that they can be associated with average yearly citations (together with the number of cited references). Finally, the paper draws some ideas to take advantage from such findings.",

As cars are evolving towards autonomy and taking over control, e.g. in the form of autopilots, it becomes harder for drivers to pinpoint the root causes of a car’s malfunctioning. Drivers may need additional information to assess these ambiguous situations correctly. However, it is yet unclear which information is relevant and helpful to drivers in such situations. Hence, we conducted a mixed-methods online survey (N = 60) on Amazon MTurk where we exposed participants to two security- and safety-critical situations with one of three different explanations. We applied Thematic and Correspondence Analysis to understand which factors in these situations moderate drivers’ information demand. We identified a fundamental information demand across scenarios that is expanded by error-specific information types. Moreover, we found that it is necessary to communicate error sources, since drivers might not be able to identify them correctly otherwise. Thereby, malicious intrusions are typically perceived as more critical than technical malfunctions.",

In this paper, we provide a client certificates-oriented perspective on the security analysis of IoT devices, which proves that although the TLS protocol is used, it is still not enough to ensure security. We utilized our self-developed passive traffic-based client certificate collection tool to conduct extensive TLS certificate collection on the ISP-level network CSTNET. We use the keywords already collected to filter out certificates related to IoT smart devices from these certificates, and analyze the security issues that exist. We designed an active crawling subsystem, put the keywords that identify the manufacturer in the certificate into the Internet to crawl its homepage, and use the characteristics of page elements to dig out unknown IoT smart devices, and conduct research on the issue of its certificate. It turns out that more needs to be done to meet the advanced security requirements in practice and deployment.",

        "abstract": "In the past few years blockchains have been a major focus for security research, resulting in significant progress in the design, formalization, and analysis of blockchain protocols. However, the more general class of distributed ledgers, which includes not just blockchains but also prominent non-blockchain protocols, such as Corda and OmniLedger, cannot be covered by the state-of-the-art in the security literature yet. These distributed ledgers often break with traditional blockchain paradigms, such as block structures to store data, system-wide consensus, or global consistency. In this paper, we close this gap by proposing the first framework for defining and analyzing the security of general distributed ledgers, with an ideal distributed ledger functionality, called Fledger, at the core of our contribution. This functionality covers not only classical blockchains but also non-blockchain distributed ledgers in a unified way. To illustrate Fledger, we first show that the prominent ideal block-chain functionalities Gledger and GPL realize (suitable instantiations of) Fledger, which captures their security properties. This implies that their respective implementations, including Bitcoin, Ouroboros Genesis, and Ouroboros Crypsinous, realize Fledger as well. Secondly, we demonstrate that Fledger is capable of precisely modeling also non-blockchain distributed ledgers by performing the first formal security analysis of such a distributed ledger, namely the prominent Corda protocol. Due to the wide spread use of Corda in industry, in particular the financial sector, this analysis is of independent interest. These results also illustrate that Fledger not just generalizes the modular treatment of blockchains to distributed ledgers, but moreover helps to unify existing results.",

To understand users’ security and privacy perceptions and requirements for secure group chat, we surveyed 996 respondents in the US and UK. Our results show that group chat presents important security and privacy challenges, some of which are not present in one-to-one chat. For example, users need to be able to manage and monitor group membership, establish trust for new group members, and filter content that they share in different chat contexts. We also find that respondents lack mechanisms for determining which tools are secure and instead rely on non-technical strategies for protecting their privacy—for example, self-filtering and carefully tracking group membership.To better understand how these results relate to existing tools, we conduct cognitive walkthroughs (a form of expert usability review) for five popular group chat tools. Our results demonstrate that while existing tools address some items identified in our surveys, this support is partial and is insufficient in many cases. As such, there is a need for improved group chat tools that better align with user perceptions and requirements. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations on improving the security and usability of secure group chat.",

In earlier years, the GSMA provided a detailed description of the architecture and configuration protocol of the eSIM over-the-air writing technology. The remote configuration protocol of eSIM cards is divided into the processes of configuration file download, installation, activation, de-activation, and deletion. In this protocol, there are attacks such as identity impersonation threats, tampering threats, denial of service and eavesdropping threats, etc. This paper analyzes the security of key session establishment during the download and the installation of configuration files. And it uses a four-channel parallel method to simulate the session establishment process. The attacker is modeled based on the Dolev-Yao model. Through the test of the SPIN model detection tool, it is found that the attacker can intercept information from eSIM and SM-DP during the establishment of the key session. However, because the attacker lacks the key, he cannot obtain valid information from the obtained ciphertext. Therefore, the attacker cannot forge or modify the message. Our work proves the security of the eSIM system.",

To address this gap, we conducted a systematic mapping study based on an automated search, covering ten years (2011--2020) and 65 relevant (out of 367) publications. We classified each publication based on established security and safety concerns (e.g., CIA triad) as well as the connection to configurable systems (e.g., ensuring security of such a system). In the end, we found that considerably more research has been conducted on safety concerns, but both properties seem under-explored in the context of configurable systems. Moreover, existing research focuses on two directions: Ensuring safety and security properties in product-line engineering; and applying product-line techniques to ensure safety and security properties.

        "abstract": "Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) have as major goal the bringing of safety and expediency to roads traffic. To do this, vehicles in these networks are enabled to exchange safety related messages containing valuable information about the traffic environment. With the help of these information, vehicles/their drivers can take early actions concerning unusual situations. However, since these messages are with critical nature, they have to be secured before being relied on. A crucial security requirement is message authentication; yet, in VANETs context, during this authentication process, the privacy of the sending vehicles should be preserved; at the same time, it should be kept possible for legal authorities to lift this privacy in liability related cases. In dealing with these demands, we proposed in our work that we called TASVPP [1] a scheme enabling vehicles to authenticate the received safety related messages while conditionally preserving the privacy of the sending vehicles. In this scheme, Road Side Units (RSUs) play the important role of authenticating vehicles to prevent outsiders from accessing the network. Hence, compromising RSUs may lead to serious consequences. Due to this, we proposed in [2] preventive, detective and reactive mechanisms to treat this problem. The main preventive mechanism we proposed is a RSU's identity/corresponding private key pair updating strategy. In the present paper, we formally validate the security of this strategy using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. We verified two security properties: authentication and confidentiality. AVISPA reports that the checked strategy is safe.",

In contrast to functional bugs, such hidden issues are not immediately visible to developers and users, and the software may still be fully usable. Consequently, developers are not forced to fix these issues, not even to investigate them. Security vulnerabilities are hidden isssues as well. However, they can put systems and users’ data at risk and lead to financial losses as well as liability and fines under data protection acts. Therefore, from a risk minimization perspective, avoiding security issues may seem more critical than avoiding quality issues when dealing with limited development resources.   In this paper, we show that both types of hidden issues are correlated. Our study of more than 400 real-world Android apps shows that apps with a high number of quality issues are likely to also have a higher number of security vulnerabilities. We argue that security and quality issues should be seen as two sides of the same coin. We investigate which types of quality problems correlate with which types of security issues and give insights into potential causes.",

In this paper we adapt secure group messaging for decentralized networks that have no central authority. Servers may still optionally be used, but they are trusted less. We define decentralized continuous group key agreement (DCGKA), a new cryptographic primitive encompassing the core of a decentralized secure group messaging protocol; we give a practical construction of a DCGKA protocol and prove its security; and we describe how to construct a full messaging protocol from DCGKA. In the face of device compromise our protocol achieves forward secrecy and post-compromise security.

This paper contributes quantitative results from a survey of 395 crypto-asset users recruited by a novel combination of deep and broad sampling. The analysis accounts for heterogeneity with a new typology that partitions the sample in three robust clusters – cypherpunks, hodlers, and rookies – using five psychometric constructs. The constructs originate from established behavioral theories with items purposefully adapted to the domain. We demonstrate the utility of this typology in better understanding users’ characteristics and security behaviors. These insights inform the design of crypto-asset solutions, guide risk communication, and suggest directions for future digital currencies.",

However, the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in an IIoT environment has problems such as low security and high cost. To overcome such issues, a mutual authentication scheme that is suitable for RFID systems, wherein techniques in Deep Learning (DL) are incorporated onto the Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function (APUF) for the secured access authentication of the IC circuits on the IoT, is proposed. The design applies the APUF-MPUF mutual authentication structure obtained by DL to generate essential real-time authentication information, thereby taking advantage of the feature that the tag in the PUF circuit structure does not need to store any essential information and resolving the problem of key storage. The proposed scheme also uses a bitwise comparison method, which hides the PUF response information and effectively reduces the resource overhead of the system during the verification process, to verify the correctness of the two strings. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has high robustness and security against different conventional attack methods, and the storage and communication costs are 95.7% and 42.0% lower than the existing schemes, respectively.",

However, the literature does not include an analysis of the security implications carried through HLS-generated RTL translations (e.g., from an untimed high-level sequential specification to a fully scheduled implementation). This article demonstrates the evidence of security vulnerabilities that emerge during the HLS translation of a high-level description of system-on-chip (SoC) intellectual properties to their corresponding RTL.

Practitioners may wonder if there is any missing piece in the puzzle that leads code reviews to miss those security defects. Therefore, the primary objective of this dissertation study is to improve the effectiveness of peer code review in identifying security defects.   To meet this goal, I plan to empirically investigate: (i) why security defects escape code reviews, (ii) what are the challenges developers face to conduct effective security code reviews, (iii) how to build effective security code review strategy, and (iv) how to make effective utilization of security experts during code reviews.",

We rectify this situation. We prove a multi-user security bound on the AEAD security of ChaCha20-Poly1305 and establish the tightness of each term in our bound through matching attacks. We show how our bound differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from the known bounds for AES-GCM, highlighting how subtle design choices lead to distinctive security properties. We translate our bound to the nonce-randomized setting employed in TLS 1.3 and elsewhere, and we additionally improve the corresponding security bounds for GCM.

        "abstract": "The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) project is an IETF effort aiming to establish an industry-wide standard for secure group messaging (SGM). Its development is supported by several major secure-messaging providers (with a combined user base in the billions) and a growing body of academic research. MLS has evolved over many iterations to become a complex, non-trivial, yet relatively ad-hoc cryptographic protocol. In an effort to tame its complexity and build confidence in its security, past analyses of MLS have restricted themselves to sub-protocols of MLS---most prominently a type of sub-protocol embodying so-called continuous group key agreement (CGKA). However, to date the task of proving or even defining the security of the full MLS protocol has been left open. In this work, we fill in this missing piece. First, we formally capture the security of SGM protocols by defining a corresponding security game, which is parametrized by a safety predicate that characterizes the exact level of security achieved by a construction. Then, we cast MLS as an SGM protocol, showing how to modularly build it from the following three main components (and some additional standard cryptographic primitives) in a black-box fashion: (a) CGKA, (b) forward-secure group AEAD (FS-GAEAD), which is a new primitive and roughly corresponds to an \"epoch'' of group messaging, and (c) a so-called PRF-PRNG, which is a two-input hash function that is a pseudorandom function (resp.\\ generator with input) in its first (resp.\\ second) input. Crucially, the security predicate for the SGM security of MLS can be expressed purely as a function of the security predicates of the underlying primitives, which allows to swap out any of the components and immediately obtain a security statement for the resulting SGM construction. Furthermore, we provide instantiations of all component primitives, in particular of CGKA with MLS's TreeKEM sub-protocol (which we prove adaptively secure) and of FS-GAEAD with a novel construction (which has already been adopted by MLS). Along the way we introduce a collection of new techniques, primitives, and results with applications to other SGM protocols and beyond. For example, we extend the Generalized Selective Decryption proof technique (which is central in CGKA literature) and prove adaptive security for another (practical) more secure CGKA protocol called RTreeKEM (Alwen et al.,\\ CRYPTO '20). The modularity of our approach immediately yields a corollary characterizing the security of an SGM construction using RTreeKEM.",

        "abstract": "Over the years, the complexity of the Linux Security Module (LSM) is keeping increasing (e.g. 10,684 LOC in Linux v2.6.0 vs. 64,018 LOC in v5.3), and the count of the authorization hooks is nearly doubled (e.g. 122 hooks in v2.6.0 vs. 224 hooks in v5.3). In addition, the computer industry has seen tremendous advancement in hardware (e.g., memory and processor frequency) in the past decade. These make the previous evaluation on LSM, which was done 18 years ago, less relevant nowadays. It is important to provide up-to-date measurement results of LSM for system practitioners so that they can make prudent trade-offs between security and performance. This work evaluates the overhead of LSM for file accesses on Linux v5.3.0. We build a performance evaluation framework for LSM. It has two parts, an extension of LMBench2.5 to evaluate the overhead of file operations for different security modules, and a security module with tunable latency for policy enforcement to study the impact of the latency of policy enforcement on the end-to-end latency of file operations. In our evaluation, we find opening a file would see about 87% (Linux v5.3) performance drop when the kernel is integrated with SELinux hooks (policy enforcement disabled) than without, while the figure was 27% (Linux v2.4.2). We found that the performance of the above downgrade is affected by two parts, policy enforcement, and hook placement. To further investigate the impact of policy enforcement and hook placement respectively, we build a Policy Testing Module, which reuses hook placements of LSM, while alternating latency of policy enforcement. With this module, we are able to quantitatively estimate the impact of the latency of policy enforcement on the end-to-end latency of file operations by using a multiple linear regression model and count policy authorization frequencies for each syscall. We then discuss and justify the evaluation results with static analysis on syscalls' call graphs.",

This paper describes a measuring approach to assess twelve aspects of this security maturity; its use to assess the impact of a lightweight package of workshops designed to increase security maturity; and a novel approach within that package to support developers in resource negotiation. Based on trials in eight organizations, involving over 80 developers, this paper demonstrates that (1) development teams can notably improve their security maturity even in the absence of security specialists; and (2) suitably guided, developers can find effective ways to promote security to product management.

These end-user Android emulators have attracted millions of users due to their advantages of running mobile apps on desktops and are especially appealing for mobile game players who demand larger screens and better performance. Besides, they commonly provide some customized assistant functionalities to improve the user experience, such as keyboard mapping and app installation from the host. To implement these services, emulators inevitably introduce communication channels between host OS and Android OS (in the Virtual Machine), thus forming a unique architecture which mobile phone does not have. However, it is unknown whether this architecture brings any new security risks to emulators. This paper performed a systematic study on end-user Android emulators and discovered a series of security flaws on communication channel authentication, permission control, and open interfaces. Attackers could exploit these flaws to bypass Android security mechanisms and escalate their privileges inside emulators, ultimately invading users' privacy, such as stealing valuable game accounts and credentials. To understand the impact of our findings, we studied six popular emulators and measured their flaws. The results showed that the issues are pervasive and could cause severe security consequences. We believe our work just shows the tip of the iceberg, and further research can be done to improve the security of this ecosystem.",

Privilege separation is the process of automatically partitioning a software system into least privileged components, and we argue that it is effective at reducing the attack surface. However, previous privilege-separation systems do not provide fine-grained separation of privileged code and non-privileged code co-existing in the same function for C/C++ applications. We propose a fine-grained partitioning technique for supporting fine-grained separation in automatic program partitioning. The technique has been applied to a set of security-sensitive networking and interactive programs. Results show that it can automatically generate executable partitions for C applications; further, partitioned programs incur acceptable runtime overheads.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new privacy threat, the Invisible Infrared Shadow Attack (IRSA), which leverages the inconspicuous infrared (IR) light emitted by indoor security cameras, to reveal in-home human activities behind opaque curtains. The key observation is that the in-home IR light source can project invisible shadows on the window curtains, which can be captured by an attacker outside using an IR-capable camera. The major challenge for IRSA lies in the shadow deformation caused by a variety of environmental factors involving the IR source position and curtain shape, which distorts the body contour. A two-stage attack scheme is proposed to circumvent the challenge. Specifically, a DeShaNet model performs accurate shadow keypoint detection through multi-dimension feature fusion. Then a scene constructor maps the 2D shadow keypoints to 3D human skeletons by iteratively reproducing the on-site shadow projection process in a virtual Unity 3D environment. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that the proposed attack scheme can be successfully launched to recover 3D skeleton of the victims, even under severe shadow deformation. Finally, we propose potential defense mechanisms against the IRSA.",

        "abstract": "Many recent works have proposed methods to train classifiers with local robustness properties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks for most inputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very common in security applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection, local robustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at the time of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to enforce global robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is strictly stronger than local robustness. In this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that satisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global robustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel booster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We structure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new verifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster increases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global robustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis. We show that we can train classifiers to satisfy different global robustness properties for three security datasets, and even multiple properties at the same time, with modest impact on the classifier's performance. For example, we train a Twitter spam account classifier to satisfy five global robustness properties, with 5.4% decrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in false positive rate, compared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn't satisfy any property.",

        "abstract": "With technological advances and the use of the Internet everywhere, And the widespread use of machine learning has become important to pay attention to security in all areas of life, especially in the healthcare field, many concerns have arisen regarding the security of patient confidential data in health systems. As it became possible to change patient data, which would lead to a change in data accuracy or to data theft, which would lead to a violation of the safety system in the field of health care. In this paper, a health system was studied in a hospital in Jordan after collecting information on 769 records for pregnant diabetics. The analysis used Python to test the accuracy of this information and improve the performance of the model being created using machine learning algorithms, including decision trees and random forests. Since patient information in any health system has been exposed to many threats and weaknesses, the main goal was to reduce them, and obtain accurate information with good performance and excellent quality, to avoid compromising health rights and data protection for patients.",

        "abstract": "With the construction of smart cities, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is growing rapidly, leading to an explosive growth of malware designed for IoT devices. These malware pose a serious threat to the security of IoT devices. The traditional malware classification methods mainly rely on feature engineering. To improve accuracy, a large number of different types of features will be extracted from malware files in these methods. That brings a high complexity to the classification. To solve these issues, a malware classification method based on Word2Vec and Multilayer Perception (MLP) is proposed in this article. First, for one malware sample, Word2Vec is used to calculate a word vector for all bytes of the binary file and all instructions in the assembly file. Second, we combine these vectors into a 256x256x2-dimensional matrix. Finally, we designed a deep learning network structure based on MLP to train the model. Then the model is used to classify the testing samples. The experimental results prove that the method has a high accuracy of 99.54%.",

However, in the IoT system, while information exchange and communication, wireless sensor network devices may not be able to resist all forms of attacks, which may lead to security issues such as user data disclosure. Aiming at the information security risks in smart city, the typical technologies in IoT is analyzed from the perspective of IoT perception layer and provides corresponding security solutions for the existing security threats. Regarding the communication security, the emerging wireless technology, long range (LoRa), is discussed, and the performance of wireless communication protocol is analyzed through simulation experiments, to verify that the IoT technology based on LoRa communication technology can improve the security of the system in the construction of smart city. The results show that REBEB, a new backoff algorithm, is similar to the binary exponential backoff algorithm in terms of throughput performance. REBEB focuses more on fairness, which is up to 0.985, and to a certain extent, its security is significantly improved. The fairness of REBEB algorithm is more than 0.4 in different nodes and competing windows, and the fairness of the system is better when the number of nodes is small. To sum up, the IoT system based on LoRa communication can effectively improve the security performance of the system in the construction of smart city and avoid the security threats in the IoT signal transmission.",

To address the alert fatigue problem that is common for security experts operating the SIEM, we propose a new alert screening scheme that leverages artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted tools to distinguish actual threats from false alarms without investigating every alert. The proposed scheme incorporates carefully chosen learning algorithms and newly designed visualization tools to facilitate speedy alert analysis and incident response. The proposed scheme is evaluated on an alert dataset collected in the security operation center of an enterprise. With a recall rate of 99.598% for highly critical alerts and a false positive rate of 0.001% reported, the proposed scheme demonstrated very promising potential for real world security operations. We believe the proposed scheme is effective in addressing the alert fatigue problem, and therefore paves the way for a consolidated security solution for network security at the enterprise level.",

        "abstract": "Security function outsourcing has witnessed both research and deployment in the recent years. While most existing services take a straight-forward approach of cloud hosting, on-path transit networks (such as ISPs) are increasingly more interested in offering outsourced security services to end users. Recent proposals (e.g., SafeBricks [40] and mbTLS [34]) have made it possible to outsource sensitive security applications to untrusted, arbitrary networks, rendering on-path security function outsourcing more promising than ever. However, to provide on-path security function outsourcing, there is one crucial component that is still missing — a practical end-to-end network protocol. Thus, the discovery and orchestration of multiple capable and willing transit networks for user-requested security functions have only been assumed in many studies without any practical solutions. In this work, we propose Opsec, an end-to-end security-outsourcing protocol that fills this gap and brings us closer to the vision of on-path security function outsourcing. Opsec automatically discovers one or more transit ISPs between a client and a server, and requests user-specified security functions efficiently. When designing Opsec, we prioritize the practicality and applicability of this new end-to-end protocol in the current Internet. Our proof-of-concept implementation of Opsec for web sessions shows that an end user can easily start a new web session with a few clicks of a browser plug-in, to specify a series of security functions of her choice. We show that it is possible to implement such a new end-to-end service model in the current Internet for the majority of the web services without any major changes to the standard protocols (e.g., TCP, TLS, HTTP) and the existing network infrastructure (e.g., ISP’s routing primitives).",

        "abstract": "Missing a security operation such as a bound check has been a major cause of security-critical bugs. Automatically checking whether the code misses a security operation in large programs is challenging since it has to understand whether the security operation is indeed necessary in the context. Recent methods typically employ cross-checking to identify deviations as security bugs, which collects functionally similar program slices and infers missed security operations through majority-voting. An inherent limitation of such approaches is that they heavily rely on a substantial number of similar code pieces to enable cross-checking. In practice, many code pieces are unique, and thus we may be unable to find adequate similar code snippets to utilize cross-checking. In this paper, we present IPPO (Inconsistent Path Pairs as a bug Oracle), a static analysis framework for detecting security bugs based on differential checking. IPPO defines several novel rules to identify code paths that share similar semantics with respect to an object, and collects them as similar-path pairs. It then investigates the path pairs for identifying inconsistent security operations with respect to the object. If one path in a path pair enforces a security operation while the other does not, IPPO reports it as a potential security bug. By utilizing on object-based path-similarity analysis, IPPO achieves a higher precision, compared to conventional code-similarity analysis methods. Through differential checking of a similar-path pair, IPPO eliminates the requirement of constructing a large number of similar code pieces, addressing the limitation of traditional cross-checking approaches. We implemented IPPO and extensively evaluated it on four widely used open-source programs: Linux kernel, OpenSSL library, FreeBSD kernel, and PHP. IPPO found 154, 5, 1, and 1 new security bugs in the above systems, respectively. We have submitted patches for all these bugs, and 136 of them have been accepted by corresponding maintainers. The results confirm the effectiveness and usefulness of IPPO in practice.",

The aim of this study is to classify the standard threats of the database according to the violation of security properties followed by the examination of different data models from their security viewpoint. A system is said to be secure if it follows three basic pillars of security i.e. confidentiality, integrity and availability. The current research analyses the security threats in database according to violation of basic pillars of security with detailed analysis of SQL injection attack for three data modeling techniques, namely relational model, Entity Attribute Value (EAV) model and dynamic tables. It presents a comparison of achieving security parameters by performing various experiments on the database stored in MySQL and proposes techniques for the application of mandatory access control in EAV model and dynamic table. After the rigorous survey and experiments performed, it has been found that EAV model is still not a completely secured model. The data leakage in EAV model is more and the application of security properties is relatively more complex than relational model and dynamic tables. Researches have been conducted in the past on these models but very few of them have discussed the security concerns of EAV model and dynamic tables. This paper tries to compare various data models based on security concerns and highlights the security issues in EAV model.",

Drawing from work in CS education and Science & Technology Studies, we designed an integrated and interdisciplinary ethics intervention to help computer security students identify where ethics and politics intersect with their technical field and encourage students to see themselves as practitioners of politics and ethics. Through analysis of student assignments, post-course surveys, and instructor reflections, we found that, while our intervention had benefits for students and instructors, it only weakly encouraged students to think of themselves as practitioners of ethics and politics. Students also struggled to confidently adjudicate ethical dilemmas given only a set of ethical principles. Finally, the ethical principles we gave students strongly shaped their analysis -- for example, students were more likely to consider disparate impacts of technology on marginalized groups when directly prompted to do so. Our results suggest that integrated and inter-disciplinary approaches have many benefits, but they require additional resources beyond a single course to effectively support students in adjudicating ethical dilemmas.",

There is an intuitive natural justice to using such strategies in the belief that the need to avoid repeated shaming occurrences will encourage them to exercise more care.

To explore and investigate this in the cyber domain, we asked those who had inadvertently triggered an adverse cyber security incident to tell us about their responses and to recount the emotions they experienced when this occurred. We also examined the impact of the organization’s management of the incident on the “culprit’s” future behaviors and attitudes. We discovered that those who had caused a cyber security incident often felt guilt and shame, and their employers’ responses either exacerbated or ameliorated these negative emotions. In the case of the former, there were enduring unfavorable consequences, both in terms of employee well-being and damaged relationships. We conclude with a set of recommendations for employers, in terms of responding to adverse cyber security incidents. The aim is to ensure that negative emotions, such as shame, do not make the incident much more damaging than it needs to be.",

        "abstract": "Due to standardization, AES is today’s most widely used block cipher. Its security is well-studied and hardware acceleration is available on a variety of platforms. Following the success of the Intel AES New Instructions (AES-NI), support for Vectorized AES (VAES) has been added in 2018 and already shown to be useful to accelerate many implementations of AES-based algorithms where the order of AES evaluations is fixed a priori.  In our work, we focus on using VAES to accelerate the computation in secure multi-party computation protocols and applications. For some MPC building blocks, such as OT extension, the AES operations are independent and known a priori and hence can be easily parallelized, similar to the original paper on VAES by Drucker et al. (ITNG’19). We evaluate the performance impact of using VAES in the AES-CTR implementations used in Microsoft CrypTFlow2, and the EMP-OT library which we accelerate by up to 24%.  The more complex case that we study for the first time in our paper are dependent AES calls that are not fixed yet in advance and hence cannot be parallelized manually. This is the case for garbling schemes. To get optimal efficiency from the hardware, enough independent calls need to be combined for each batch of AES executions. We identify such batches using a deferred execution technique paired with early execution to reduce non-locality issues and more static techniques using circuit depth and explicit gate independence. We present a performance and a modularity-focused technique to compute the AES operations efficiently while also immediately using the results and preparing the inputs. Using these techniques, we achieve a performance improvement via VAES of up to 244% for the ABY framework and of up to 28% for the EMP-AGMPC framework. By implementing several garbling schemes from the literature using VAES acceleration, we obtain a 171% better performance for ABY.",

While smart spaces are beneficial and desired in many aspects, they could be compromised and expose privacy, security, or render the whole environment a hostile space in which regular tasks cannot be accomplished anymore. In fact, ensuring the security of smart spaces is a very challenging task due to the heterogeneity of devices, vast attack surface, and device resource limitations. The key objective of this study is to minimize the manual work in enforcing the security of smart spaces by leveraging the autonomic computing paradigm in the management of IoT environments. More specifically, we strive to build an autonomic manager that can monitor the smart space continuously, analyze the context, plan and execute countermeasures to maintain the desired level of security, and reduce liability and risks of security breaches. We follow the microservice architecture pattern and propose a generic ontology named Secure Smart Space Ontology (SSSO) for describing dynamic contextual information in security-enhanced smart spaces. Based on SSSO, we build an autonomic security manager with four layers that continuously monitors the managed spaces, analyzes contextual information and events, and automatically plans and implements adaptive security policies.As the evaluation, focusing on a current BlackBerry customer problem, we deployed the proposed autonomic security manager to maintain the security of a smart conference room with 32 devices and 66 services.

Most notably, the central message brokers inherent in publish/subscribe systems introduce a designated weak spot for security as they can access all communication messages. To address this issue, we propose ENTRUST, a novel solution for key server-based end-to-end security in publish/subscribe systems. ENTRUST transparently realizes confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for publish/subscribe systems without any modification of the underlying protocol.

        "abstract": "To enhance the usability of password authentication, typo-tolerant password authentication schemes permit certain deviations in the user-supplied password, to account for common typographical errors yet still allow the user to successfully log in. In prior work, analysis by Chatterjee et al. demonstrated that typo-tolerance indeed notably improves password usability, yet (surprisingly) does not appear to significantly degrade authentication security. In practice, major web services such as Facebook have employed typo-tolerant password authentication systems. In this paper, we revisit the security impact of typo-tolerant password authentication. We observe that the existing security analysis of such systems considers only password spraying attacks. However, this threat model is incomplete, as password authentication systems must also contend with credential stuffing and tweaking attacks. Factoring in these missing attack vectors, we empirically re-evaluate the security impact of password typo-tolerance using password leak datasets, discovering a significantly larger degradation in security. To mitigate this issue, we explore machine learning classifiers that predict when a password's security is likely affected by typo-tolerance. Our resulting models offer various suitable operating points on the functionality-security tradeoff spectrum, ultimately allowing for partial deployment of typo-tolerant password authentication, preserving its functionality for many users while reducing the security risks.",

Many people choose cloud computing for businesses because of it’s budget-friendly, excellent efficiency and performance features. But lately, the intrusion on cloud-based system raised a significant concern for choosing this platform. Due to the increasing rate of computer networks and their usage, the global IT infrastructure is prone to attacks. If the issue is left unattended, it can cause significant trouble for IT sector. Intrusion detection systems are signature-based, means it would look in a certain type of data packet, and it would watch all the traffic in a network which has visibility to and make a decision if it is good traffic or bad. It alerts analyst to look at the traffic that could be malicious. Snort is an open-source intrusion detection system that can monitor any traffic going in or out of the network and also monitor malicious behavior or any violation. To enable secure and trustworthy information transmission across diverse cloud companies in today’s networked business settings, a high level of security is required. Because cyber-attacks are only getting more complicated these days, it is critical that defense technology keeps up. After traditional security technologies fail, an intrusion detection system functions as an adaptive safeguard device for system security. In our research, we have shown by using this protocol traffic from source 0.0.0.0:68 to DST 255.255.255:67 (UDP) is being blocked on our WAN. It prevents the user from obtaining a DHCP address.",

The frequency and sophistication of past attacks against such embedded platforms highlight the need for better defense mechanisms. Existing estimation-based control monitors have tradeoffs, with lightweight linear state estimators lacking sufficient coverage, and heavier data-driven learned models facing implementation and accuracy issues on a constrained real-time RAV. We present Mini-Me, a data-driven online monitoring framework that models the program-level control state dynamics to detect runtime data-oriented attacks against RAVs. Mini-Me leverages the internal dataflow information and control variable dependencies of RAV controller functions to train a neural network-based approximate model as the lightweight replica of the original controller programs. Mini-Me runs the minimal approximate model and detects malicious control state deviation by comparing the estimated outputs with those outputs calculated by the original controller program. We demonstrate Mini-Me on a widely adopted RAV physical model as well as popular RAV virtual models based on open-source firmware, ArduPilot and PX4, and show its effectiveness in detecting five types of attack cases with an average 0.34% space overhead and 2.6% runtime overhead.",

We compare the effect of remotely played out training content on user behavior, i.e, on getting employees to change their password. The first content was directly embedded into an e-mail, the second was compiled on an intranet web page, and the third content was embedded into a video. Password changes were observed solely within the IT backend on the basis of events and timestamps generated by the company’s Active Directory service. For the campaign four representative samples (140 employees per sample) among the staff were selected and assigned to the different training contents. A fourth group served as a control group. During a period of 6 weeks, the content was played out two times. Unexpectedly, the measured password change rate observed was very low. Further, compared to the control group’s behavior, none of the different content formats played out led to significant more password changes. Clearly, the campaign failed according to its aim. Based on our observations, we provide several possible explanations for which there is some evidence from the literature.",

        "abstract": "Cyber attacks become more and more prevalent every day. One type of cyber attack is known as a side channel attack, where attackers exploit information leakage from the physical execution of a program, e.g. timing or power leakage, to uncover secret information, such as encryption keys or other sensitive data. There have been various attempts at addressing the problem of preventing side-channel attacks, often relying on various measures to decrease the discernibility of several code variants or code paths. Most techniques require a high-degree of expertise by the developer, who often employs ad hoc, hand-crafted code-patching in an attempt to make it more secure. In this paper, we take a different approach: building on the idea of ladderisation, inspired by Montgomery Ladders. We present a semi-automatic tool-supported technique, aimed at the non-specialised developer, which refactors (a class of) C programs into functionally (and even algorithmically) equivalent counterparts with improved security properties. Our approach provides refactorings that transform the source code into its ladderised equivalent, driven by an underlying verified rewrite system, based on dependent types. Our rewrite system automatically finds rewritings of selected C expressions, facilitating the production of their equivalent ladderised counterparts for a subset of C. We demonstrate our approach on a number of representative examples from the cryptographic domain, showing increased security.",

        "abstract": "Demonstrating that a system satisfies a complete, adequate, and consistent set of security requirements to protect its critical assets is an essential aspect of security evaluation and assurance. Arguing that each of the security properties for a given system is satisfied and supported by evidence is a requirement for presenting an effective and compelling security assurance argument. The decomposition of a security assurance case to support this argumentation can be challenging as different systems have different security objectives and, consequently, different security requirements. In this paper, we propose a security assurance argument pattern called Security Property Decomposition. This pattern is extracted by studying existing security assurance case models and their decomposition to argue the satisfaction of security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It also considers the requirements prescribed by several prominent security standards for developing secure and trustworthy systems in different application domains. As a result, the Security Property Decomposition pattern can be instantiated in the context of different application domains to demonstrate that the security requirements related to the functionality of the system have been adequately satisfied as part of a structured security assurance case. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed pattern, we present an application of the pattern demonstrating compliance with a relevant security standard in the automotive domain.",

However, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to the adoption of DL models in practice. Unfortunately, existing interpretation approaches are proposed for supervised learning models and/or non-security domains, which are unadaptable for unsupervised DL models and fail to satisfy special requirements in security domains. In this paper, we propose DeepAID, a general framework aiming to (1) interpret DL-based anomaly detection systems in security domains, and (2) improve the practicality of these systems based on the interpretations. We first propose a novel interpretation method for unsupervised DNNs by formulating and solving well-designed optimization problems with special constraints for security domains. Then, we provide several applications based on our Interpreter as well as a model-based extension Distiller to improve security systems by solving domain-specific problems. We apply DeepAID over three types of security-related anomaly detection systems and extensively evaluate our Interpreter with representative prior works. Experimental results show that DeepAID can provide high-quality interpretations for unsupervised DL models while meeting the special requirements of security domains. We also provide several use cases to show that DeepAID can help security operators to understand model decisions, diagnose system mistakes, give feedback to models, and reduce false positives.",

In this article and through an analysis of work already carried out in the area, we propose a metrics framework suitable for supply chains and in the industrial context. Additionally, and to promote the level of trust between the nodes of a supply chain, it is also elaborated on a model of continuous safety assessment, using the same metrics and goals related to certification (based on the IEC 62443 standard). In addition to the contribution to the trust level, the proposed framework can also facilitate the certification process from the perspective of the technological infrastructure.

Defenses exist, but many require efficient intra-address-space isolation. Execute-only memory, for example, requires read protection on code segments, and shadow stacks require protection from buffer overwrites. Intel’s Protection Keys for Userspace (PKU) could, in principle, provide the intra-kernel isolation needed by such defenses, but, when used as designed, it applies only to user-mode application code.  This paper presents an unconventional approach to memory protection, allowing PKU to be used within the operating system kernel on existing Intel hardware, replacing the traditional user/supervisor isolation mechanism and, simultaneously, enabling efficient intra-kernel isolation. We call the resulting mechanism Protection Keys for Kernelspace (PKK). To demonstrate its utility and efficiency, we present a system we call IskiOS: a Linux variant featuring execute-only memory (XOM) and the first-ever race-free shadow stacks for x86-64.  Experiments with the LMBench kernel microbenchmarks display a geometric mean overhead of about 11% for PKK and no additional overhead for XOM. IskiOS’s shadow stacks bring the total to 22%. For full applications, experiments with the system benchmarks of the Phoronix test suite display negligible overhead for PKK and XOM, and less than 5% geometric mean overhead for shadow stacks.",

However, the collection of security patches still remains a challenging problem. Existing works mainly adopt a matching-based design that uses auxiliary information in CVE/NVD to reduce the search scope of patch commits. However, our preliminary study shows that these approaches can only cover a small part of disclosed OSS vulnerabilities (about 12%-53%) even with manual assistance. To facilitate the collection of OSS security patches, this paper proposes a ranking-based approach, named PatchScout, which ranks the code commits in the OSS code repository based on their correlations to a given vulnerability. By exploiting the broad correlations between a vulnerability and code commits, patch commits are expected to be put to front positions in the ranked results. Compared with existing works, our approach could help to locate more security patches and meet a balance between the patch coverage and the manual efforts involved. We evaluate PatchScout with 685 OSS CVEs and the results show that it helps to locate 92.70% patches with acceptable manual workload. To further demonstrate the utility of PatchScout, we perform a study on 5 popular OSS projects and 225 CVEs to understand the patch deployment practice across branches, and we obtain many new findings.",

        "abstract": "We highlight how Bitcoin addresses are reused in transactions (implicitly or explicitly), despite recommendations and best practice strongly advise to avoid this. We analyse the blockchain with the purpose to find and count highly reused Bitcoin addresses, starting from the birth of the protocol in 2009. In this study we also include hidden addresses: these addresses are not the explicit endpoints of a transaction, but they are somehow contained in it (e.g., in the script of a Pay to Script Hash transaction). Finally, we try to de-anonymise the top-100 reused addresses, grouping and linking them to their wallet owner. This work shows that such a misuse in reusing the address often corresponds to malicious activities in the bitcoin ecosystem. These results push towards a mandatory single usage, which mitigates dangerous consequences.",

        "abstract": "Closely monitoring the behavior of a software system during its execution enables developers and analysts to observe, and ultimately understand, how it works. This kind of dynamic analysis can be instrumental to reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and debugging. While these analyses are typically well-supported for homogeneous desktop platforms (e.g., x86 desktop PCs), they can rarely be applied in the heterogeneous world of embedded systems. One approach to enable dynamic analyses of embedded systems is to move software stacks from physical systems into virtual environments that sufficiently model hardware behavior. This process which we call \"rehosting\" poses a significant research challenge with major implications for security analyses. Although rehosting has traditionally been an unscientific and ad-hoc endeavor undertaken by domain experts with varying time and resources at their disposal, researchers are beginning to address rehosting challenges systematically and in earnest. In this paper, we establish that emulation is insufficient to conduct large-scale dynamic analysis of real-world hardware systems and present rehosting as a firmware-centric alternative. Furthermore, we taxonomize preliminary rehosting efforts, identify the fundamental components of the rehosting process, and propose directions for future research.",

In order to reduce frustration and help fulfill the promise of smart homes, we need to explore the experience of security and privacy in situ. We analyze an ethnographic study observing six UK households over six months to present a longitudinal view of security and privacy user experiences in smart products. We find inconsistencies in managing security and privacy, e.g., contrasting the ease of granting and difficulty of withholding consent. We identify security and privacy issues in repurposing smart home devices – using devices outside of their initial intended purposes.

We propose two novel chosen ciphertext transformations, ETC1 and ETC2, in which re-encryption is replaced by checking the error term of the input ciphertext. We show that our new ciphertext validity check can be securely applied to lattice based encryption schemes under specific conditions. For the NIST post-quantum standardization candidate Threebears we show a speed-up for decapsulation of up to 37.4%. Moreover, as our method only changes the validation check during decapsulation, it is fully backwards compatible with existing implementations of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation.",

        "abstract": "Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are trusted machines that perform sensitive operations in critical ecosystems. They are usually required by law in financial and government digital services. The most important feature of an HSM is its ability to store sensitive credentials and cryptographic keys inside a tamper-resistant hardware, so that every operation is done internally through a suitable API, and such sensitive data are never exposed outside the device. HSMs are now conveniently provided in the cloud, meaning that the physical machines are remotely hosted by some provider and customers can access them through a standard API. The property of keeping sensitive data inside the device is even more important in this setting as a vulnerable application might expose the full API to an attacker. Unfortunately, in the last 20+ years a multitude of practical API-level attacks have been found and proved feasible in real devices. The latest version of PKCS#11, the most popular standard API for HSMs, does not address these issues leaving all the flaws possible. In this paper, we propose the first secure HSM configuration that does not require any restriction or modification of the PKCS#11 API and is suitable to cloud HSM solutions, where compliance to the standard API is of paramount importance. The configuration relies on a careful separation of roles among the different HSM users so that known API flaws are not exploitable by any attacker taking control of the application. We prove the correctness of the configuration by providing a formal model in the state-of-the-art Tamarin prover and we show how to implement the configuration in a real cloud HSM solution.",

These systems are connected to IT systems and the Internet, the intersections of their users – typically control systems engineers and operators – with security requirements and systems add to the complexity of the threats faced by these environments. The challenges of usable security in IT systems have been studied extensively, including work on security-usability threat modeling (i.e. lack of usability exacerbating security issues). However, no work has examined similar challenges within ICS settings where, in addition to the regular requirements of information confidentiality, information integrity and information availability, requirements such as processsafety, processintegrity and processreliability are paramount for the users. Using the case of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), we detail the workflow that the user undertake for a security task. We analyze this workflow using STRIDE, an established threat modeling approach. We then map the threats against an existing security-usability threat model for IT systems whilst also taking into account the specific process-related requirements critical to ICS users. We then derive an initial security-usability threat model for ICS as a first step towards further work in this regard.",

        "abstract": "Within vehicles, the Controller Area Network (CAN) allows efficient communication between the electronic control units (ECUs) responsible for controlling the various subsystems. The CAN protocol was not designed to include much support for secure communication. The fact that so many critical systems can be accessed through an insecure communication network presents a major security concern. Adding security features to CAN is difficult due to the limited resources available to the individual ECUs and the costs that would be associated with adding the necessary hardware to support any additional security operations without overly degrading the performance of standard communication. Replacing the protocol is another option, but it is subject to many of the same problems. The lack of security becomes even more concerning as vehicles continue to adopt smart features. Smart vehicles have a multitude of communication interfaces an attacker could exploit to gain access to the networks. In this work, we propose a security framework that is based on physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and lightweight cryptography (LWC). The framework does not require any modification to the standard CAN protocol while also minimizing the amount of additional message overhead required for its operation. The improvements in our proposed framework result in major reduction in the number of CAN frames that must be sent during operation. For a system with 20 ECUs, for example, our proposed framework only requires 6.5% of the number of CAN frames that is required by the existing approach to successfully authenticate every ECU.",

        "abstract": "Cybercrime reports showed an increase in the number of attacks targeting financial institutions. Indeed, banks were the target of 30% of the total number of cyber-attacks. One of the recommended methods for driving the security challenges is to implement an Information Security Governance Framework (ISGF), a comprehensive practice that starts from the top management and ends with the smallest function in a bank. Although such initiatives are effective, they typically take years to achieve and require loads of resources, especially for larger banks or if there are multiple ISGFs available for the bank to choose. These implementation challenges showed the necessity of having a method for evaluating the adequacy of an ISGF for a bank. The research performed during the preparation of this article did not reveal any available structured evaluation method for an ISGF before its implementation. This chapter introduces a novel method for scoring an ISGF to assess its adequacy for a bank without implementing it. The suggested approach is based on ISGF decomposition and transformation into a survey that will be answered by security experts. The survey results were loaded into a Deep Learning Algorithm that produced a scoring model that could predict the adequacy of an ISGF for a bank with an accuracy of 75%.",

We propose that supporting the trading zone is a route to sustainable, workable security change improvements. Prompts for such improvements are already in place, in the security stories that reach business leaders through news media, or anecdotes from trusted peers. However, a shift in perspective is needed to view these stories and anecdotes as prompts for individual decision makers to enter into the trading zone with security specialists. We illustrate how to facilitate this shift by recasting security ontology tools, previously centred around security-specific expertise, as a support device to enrich conversations between business expertise and security advice toward finding workable security choices. We frame our proposal within a broader view of community transformation, exploring the important principle of identifying practical opportunities to inform discussions about security solutions that are appropriate in the business context. Community-level discussions have potential to lead to more lasting, effective improvements than those instigated by one-way interventions from security specialists. We extend the view, applying the paradigm to articulate the importance of two-way conversations between business peers and security specialists.",

Typically, keys are kept in designated schemes called wallets, whose main purpose is to store these keys securely. One such system is the BIP32 wallet (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32), which since its introduction in 2012 has been adopted by countless Bitcoin users and is one of the most frequently used wallet system today. Surprisingly, very little is known about the concrete security properties offered by this system. In this work, we propose the first formal analysis of the BIP32 system in its entirety and without any modification. Building on the recent work of Das et al. (CCS '19), we put forth a formal model for hierarchical deterministic wallet systems (such as BIP32) and give a security reduction in this model from the existential unforgeability of the ECDSA signature algorithm that is used in BIP32. We conclude by giving concrete security parameter estimates achieved by the BIP32 standard, and show that by moving to an alternative key derivation method we can achieve a tighter reduction offering an additional 20 bits of security (111 vs. 91 bits of security) at no additional costs.",

However, such devices also have many inherent vulnerabilities, which make them a popular target for cyberattacks. The heterogeneity of IoT devices and their interactions may make them susceptible to new types of attacks, and also make usability difficult for the aging population. Furthermore, the elderly may be particularly vulnerable and uncomfortable with new technologies. Existing network management interfaces are designed for domain experts, and are impracticable for non-technical users.  We propose an agenda for exploring the design of (1) interfaces and guidelines to enable senior users to manage the security posture of IoT devices, and (2) security tools that identify such issues and collaborate with the user to resolve them. We structure this agenda around the core concepts of autonomy, control, and delegation, summarized by the concept of explainable stewardship. We argue that goal (1) must be addressed with qualitative studies of user attitudes towards prototype interfaces. Goal (2) requires the integration of existing network anomaly detection algorithms into techniques which can summarize and explain their meaning.  Much remains to be done to ensure older users can take advantage of smart devices without suffering cybersecurity incidents.

        "abstract": "Security patches in open source software, providing security fixes to identified vulnerabilities, are crucial in protecting against cyber attacks. Security advisories and announcements are often publicly released to inform the users about potential security vulnerability. Despite the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) publishes identified vulnerabilities, a vast majority of vulnerabilities and their corresponding security patches remain beyond public exposure, e.g., in the open source libraries that are heavily relied on by developers. As many of these patches exist in open sourced projects, the problem of curating and gathering security patches can be difficult due to their hidden nature. An extensive and complete security patches dataset could help end-users such as security companies, e.g., building a security knowledge base, or researcher, e.g., aiding in vulnerability research.To efficiently curate security patches including undisclosed patches at large scale and low cost, we propose a deep neural-network-based approach built upon commits of open source repositories. First, we design and build security patch datasets that include 38,291 security-related commits and 1,045 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) patches from four large-scale C programming language libraries. We manually verify each commit, among the 38,291 security-related commits, to determine if they are security related.We devise and implement a deep learning-based security patch identification system that consists of two composite neural networks: one commit-message neural network that utilizes pretrained word representations learned from our commits dataset and one code-revision neural network that takes code before revision and after revision and learns the distinction on the statement level. Our system leverages the power of the two networks for Security Patch Identification. Evaluation results show that our system significantly outperforms SVM and K-fold stacking algorithms. The result on the combined dataset achieves as high as 87.93% F1-score and precision of 86.24%.We deployed our pipeline and learned model in an industrial production environment to evaluate the generalization ability of our approach. The industrial dataset consists of 298,917 commits from 410 new libraries that range from a wide functionalities. Our experiment results and observation on the industrial dataset proved that our approach can identify security patches effectively among open sourced projects.",

With truly global economies as well as wide-scale digitalization of services, e-banking is a key sector for development as well as advancement due to changing technological and security constraints which not only help create new transaction and user experiences but also create new interaction methods, use cases, and security domains. These aspects are prominent in countries with developing economies and banking sectors, such as Bangladesh. Alongside the country's growing economy, its e-banking sector is also rapidly developing to adapt to new technological advances and cater to the local market. With these new growth paradigms, questions of security and protection are commonplace. Historically, the country's banking sector has been subject to various cyber security attacks on both the consumer and enterprise side. While some of these are affected by technological vulnerabilities, others are due to fraud and extortion. With digitalization and e-banking, the country's banking sector has been able to mitigate various cyber security issues, while new cyber security threats have become prominent due various infrastructural or internal issues. This research aims to contextualize the current state of cyber security of the e-banking sector in Bangladesh, including threats, incidents, and mitigation techniques. The research tries to highlight the importance of security guidelines and solutions developed with new threat vectors and localization of Bangladesh in mind.

One of the fastest-growing Internet of Things' (IoT') technologies, Intelligent Home is becoming more involved in people's lives. Controlling and monitoring home appliances remotely with just a single click or touch of a smart device or a laptop is becoming a common practice. This is possible through IoT like Intelligent/Smart Home System. Since home appliances are required to be connected to internet in order to make them accessible and being monitored remotely, it is obvious that they are vulnerable to cyber-attack. Thus, security and privacy are the main concerns when implementing smart home systems. This paper has discussed and analyzed about security constraints, identify major potential security risks, security constraints, security requirements, the nature of attacks, the security threats at each layer of IoT architecture on smart home and finally design secure smart system.",

In this work, we characterize a wide variety of real-world WiFi threats at an unprecedented scale, involving 19 million WiFi access points (APs) mostly located in China, by deploying a crowdsourced security checking system on 14 million mobile devices in the wild. Leveraging the collected data, we reveal the landscape of nationwide WiFi threats for the first time. We find that the prevalence, riskiness, and breakdown of WiFi threats deviate significantly from common understandings and prior studies. In particular, we detect attacks at around 4% of all WiFi APs, uncover that most WiFi attacks are driven by an underground economy, and provide strong evidence of web analytics platforms being the bottleneck of its monetization chain. Further, we provide insightful guidance for defending against WiFi attacks at scale, and some of our efforts have already yielded real-world impact---effectively disrupted the WiFi attack ecosystem.",

While several security mechanisms exist that can be applied in an e-Health system, they may not be adequate due to the complexity of involved workflows, and to the possible inherent correlation among health-related concepts that may be exploited by unauthorized subjects. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for the validation of security and privacy policies in a complex e-Health system, that leverages a formal description of clinical workflows and a semantically enriched definition of the data model used by the workflows, in order to build a comprehensive model of the system that can be analyzed with automated model checking and ontology-based reasoning techniques. To validate the proposed methodology, we applied it to two case studies, subjected to the directives of the EU GDPR regulation for the protection of health data, and demonstrated its ability to correctly verify the fulfillment of desired policies in different scenarios.",

The public data shows that the vehicle networking configuration accounts for 21% in the new car listed in 2017, which is 16% of the listing of new cars in 2016. With the launch of new models, the car assembly ratio will continue to improve, in accordance with the consistency of the industry, to 2020 OTA will enter a large-scale application state, China's car network users will grow from existing 7 million to 2020 Around 44 million, China's car network market will reach nearly $ 33.8 billion. In this process, the vehicle operation is more convenient, and the use process becomes more intimate. All of this comes from the gradual improvement of vehicle enterprises' functionality. Among them, the real-time networking update of the vehicle electronic control unit (especially entertainment interactive system) is used in real time. The increasing number of automotive electronics, vehicles are facing more controller upgrade requirements after the R & D phase and SOP. Under the management method of existing vehicle electronic control components, the controller upgrade must be upgraded by the product engineer with special equipment or by 4S shop maintenance engineers to upgrade the special diagnostic. In recent years, the increase in electric control components has more and more cases requiring vehicles to be upgraded after the factory, whereby OTA technology came into being. Here, OTA technology specially refers to software / firmware upgrades for the in-vehicle electronic control unit (ECU) through wireless communication technology. With the rapid development of the vehicle industry in the direction of intelligence, connectivity and electrification, the number of Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is increasing in the automotive system. Updates and iterations for the vehicle and ECU have been realized by software updates (OTA) instead of physical approaches. At present, hacking incidents targeting on vehicles happen frequently. As a significant function of intelligent connected vehicles, the OTA function becomes a key target of hackers. Hijacking, tampering, replacing and other methods are used to attack the OTA upgrade link of vehicles. This paper proposes a design of a safe OTA upgrade scheme through the security analysis based on the current OTA upgrade architecture of intelligent connected vehicles to improve security of OTA upgrade.",

This addresses the scenario where a party P1 commits to a value x to be used in a subsequent secure computation with another party P2 that wants to receive assurance that P1 did not cheat, i.e. that x was indeed the value inputted into the secure computation. Our constructions operate in the publicly verifiable covert (PVC) security model, which is a relaxation of the malicious model of MPC, appropriate in settings where P1 faces a reputational harm if caught cheating. We introduce the notion of PVC commitment scheme and indexed hash functions to build commitment schemes tailored to the PVC framework, and propose constructions for both arithmetic and Boolean circuits that result in very efficient circuits. From a practical standpoint, our constructions for Boolean circuits are 60x faster to evaluate securely, and use 36x less communication than baseline methods based on hashing. Moreover, we show that our constructions are tight in terms of required non-linear operations, by proving lower bounds on the nonlinear gate count of commitment verification circuits. Finally, we present a technique to amplify the security properties our constructions that allows to efficiently recover malicious guarantees with statistical security.",

        "abstract": "OFDM is a widely used modulation scheme. It transmits data over multiple subcarriers in parallel, which provides high resilience against frequency-dependent channel drops (fading) and achieves high throughput. Due to the proliferation of OFDM-enabled devices and the increasing need for location information, the research community has suggested using OFDM symbols for secure (time-of-flight) distance measurements. However, a consequence of relying on multiple subcarriers is long symbols (time-wise). This makes OFDM systems not a natural fit for secure ranging, as long symbols allow an attacker longer observation and reaction times to mount a so-called early-detect/late-commit attack. Despite these concerns, a recent standardization effort (IEEE 802.11az [5]) envisions the use of OFDM-based signals for secure ranging. This paper lays the groundwork for analyzing OFDM time-of-flight measurements and studies the security guarantees of OFDM-based ranging against a physical-layer attacker. We use BPSK and 4-QAM, the most robust configurations, as examples to present a strategy that increases the chances for early-detecting the transmitted symbols. Our theoretical analysis and simulations show that such OFDM systems are vulnerable to early-detection/late-commit attacks, irrespective of frame length and number of subcarriers. We identify the underlying causes and explore a possible countermeasure, consisting of orthogonal noise and randomized phase.",

In this paper, we evaluate mobile autofill frameworks on iOS and Android, examining whether they achieve substantive benefits over the ad-hoc desktop environment or become a problematic single point of failure. Our results find that while the frameworks address several common issues, they also enforce insecure behavior and fail to provide password managers sufficient information to override the frameworks’ insecure behavior, resulting in mobile managers being less secure than their desktop counterparts overall. We also demonstrate how these frameworks act as a confused deputy in manager-assisted credential phishing attacks. Our results demonstrate the need for significant improvements to mobile autofill frameworks. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the design and implementation of secure autofill frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances indicate that quantum computers will soon be reality. Motivated by this ever more realistic threat for existing classical cryptographic protocols, researchers have developed several schemes to resist “quantum attacks.” In particular, for electronic voting (e-voting), several schemes relying on properties of quantum mechanics have been proposed. However, each of these proposals comes with a different and often not well-articulated corruption model, has different objectives, and is accompanied by security claims that are never formalized and are at best justified only against specific attacks. To address this, we propose the first formal security definitions for quantum e-voting protocols. With these at hand, we systematize and evaluate the security of previously proposed quantum e-voting protocols; we examine the claims of these works concerning privacy, correctness, and verifiability, and if they are correctly attributed to the proposed protocols. In all non-trivial cases, we identify specific quantum attacks that violate these properties. We argue that the cause of these failures lies in the absence of formal security models and references to the existing cryptographic literature.",

SecRSL is also, to our knowledge, the first security logic developed over an axiomatic memory model. Thus we also present the first definitions of information-flow security for an axiomatic weak memory model, against which we prove SecRSL sound. SecRSL ensures that programs satisfy a constant-time security guarantee, while being free of undefined behaviour.  We apply SecRSL to implement and verify the functional correctness and constant-time security of a range of concurrency primitives, including a spinlock module, a mixed-sensitivity mutex, and multiple synchronous channel implementations. Empirical performance evaluations of the latter demonstrate SecRSL’s power to support the development of secure and performant concurrent C programs.",

We show that in realistic deployments, despite countermeasures, HRP is hard to configure to be both performant and secure. If a distance missdetection rate is set to less than 10% (in benign scenarios), the probability of a successful distance shortening attacks ranges from 7% to over 90%.",

Though the advantages offered by BLE-enabled WHMDs in tracking, diagnosing, and intervening with patients are substantial, the risk of cyberattacks on these devices is likely to increase with device complexity and new communication protocols. Furthermore, vendors face risk and financial tradeoffs between speed to market and ensuring device security in all situations. Previous research has explored the security and privacy of such devices by manually testing popular BLE-enabled WHMDs in the market and generally discussed categories of possible attacks, while mostly focused on IP devices. In this work, we propose a new semi-automated framework that can be used to identify and discover both known and unknown vulnerabilities in WHMDs. To demonstrate its implementation, we validate it with a number of commercially available BLE-enabled enabled wearable devices. Our results show that the devices are vulnerable to a number of attacks, including eavesdropping, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks. The proposed framework could therefore be used to evaluate potential devices before adoption into a secure network or, ideally, during the design and implementation of new devices.",

        "abstract": "Electronic consent (e-consent) has the potential to solve many paper-based consent approaches. Existing approaches, however, face challenges regarding privacy and security. This literature review aims to provide an overview of privacy and security challenges and requirements proposed by papers discussing e-consent implementations, as well as the manner in which state-of-the-art solutions address them. We conducted a systematic literature search using ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed Central. We included papers providing comprehensive discussions of one or more technical aspects of e-consent systems. Thirty-one papers met our inclusion criteria. Two distinct topics were identified, the first being discussions of e-consent representations and the second being implementations of e-consent in data sharing systems. The main challenge for e-consent representations is gathering the requirements for a “valid” consent. For the implementation papers, many provided some requirements but none provided a comprehensive overview. Blockchain is identified as a solution to transparency and trust issues in traditional client-server systems, but several challenges hinder it from being applied in practice. E-consent has the potential to grant data subjects control over their data. However, there is no agreed-upon set of security and privacy requirements that must be addressed by an e-consent platform. Therefore, security- and privacy-by-design techniques should be an essential part of the development lifecycle for such a platform.",

A network policy satisfies the least privilege principle by minimizing the network permissions to only those needed by users and applications. However, administrators face many challenges in creating a least privilege policy since it requires a detailed understanding of the network topology and knowing the communication requirements of every network application and user. This paper addresses those challenges by introducing a graph-based policy specification framework to capture a network's communication requirements and a network compiler that turns those requirements into an enforceable policy. To offset the effort of building such a stringent policy, we incorporate patterns to spread the work of policy creation over time and people. In the paper, we first elaborate on how our framework's semantics enhances network security and resilience. We then introduce a Security Policy Regression Testing tool (SPRT), which leverages our framework's semantics, to test and reason about consistency, correctness, and relevance of network security policies. Finally, we outline relevant research directions.",

Functioning as a cache between the controller and the switches, the flow table mitigates this bottleneck by caching flow rules received from the controller at each switch, but is very limited in size due to the high cost and power consumption of the underlying storage medium. It thus presents an easy target for attacks. Observing that many existing defenses are based on simplistic attack models, we develop a model of intelligent attacks that exploit specific cache-like behaviors of the flow table to infer its internal configuration and state, and then design attack parameters accordingly. Our evaluations show that such attacks can accurately expose the internal parameters of the target flow table and cause measurable damage with the minimum effort.",

With this paper, we first propose a formal threat model which captures the above-mentioned wide class of attacks, and permits to quantitatively evaluate how tampering of one or more anchor locations undermines the user’s localization accuracy. We specifically derive a Cramér Rao Bound for the localization error, and we assess a number of example scenarios.

        "abstract": "There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently, which have not always considered security or data security concerns: A high degree of security is required when considering the sharing of medical data over networks. In most IoT-based systems, especially those within smart-homes and smart-cities, there is a bridging point (fog computing) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks, as well as small amounts of data processing. The fog nodes can have useful knowledge and potential for constructive security and control over both the sensor network and the data transmitted over the Internet. Smart healthcare services utilise such networks of IoT systems. It is therefore vital that medical data emanating from IoT systems is highly secure, to prevent fraudulent use, whilst maintaining quality of service providing assured, verified and complete data. In this article, we examine the development of a Cognitive Fog (CF) model, for secure, smart healthcare services, that is able to make decisions such as opting-in and opting-out from running processes and invoking new processes when required, and providing security for the operational processes within the fog system. Overall, the proposed ensemble security model performed better in terms of Accuracy Rate, Detection Rate, and a lower False Positive Rate (standard intrusion detection measurements) than three base classifiers (K-NN, DBSCAN, and DT) using a standard security dataset (NSL-KDD).",

Although much research done on behavioral economics separately, however, behavioral economics is mostly unexplored in the field of software requirements engineering process. With the growing needs of personal data security and privacy concerns, the software community needs to adapt it to software requirements optimization to incorporate and prioritize requirements related to personal data security and privacy. In this study, our main objective is to explore the behavioral economics issues towards data security and privacy and adapt them into the software requirement process.

        "abstract": "Today, the financial technology market (fintech market) has the highest growth rate among other emerging markets and is often considered the most promising. Cryptocurrency, crowdfunding, and P2P are no longer specific economic terms, now they are increasingly heard from the mouths of the common people. The rapid development of technology has led to the active advancement of the financial, monetary and credit systems of many developed and developing countries. This entails a transformation of the usual economic system. For instance, people increasingly prefer to use non-cash payment methods, refuse small bank loans, preferring to borrow through Internet platforms from other individuals. All this poses a direct threat to the economic security of an individual. The object of the research is new financial technologies. The subject of the study is the impact of the introduction of new financial technologies on economic security. The goal of the study is to determine the impact of financial technology on economic security, identifying ways to ensure it. The objectives are to analyze modern financial technologies and identify their importance for economic security; recognize trends in the financial market; reveal the specifics of legal regulation of new financial technologies; examine the impact of new financial technologies on the banking system; detect major technological trends in the financial market; develop methods for preventing threats to economic security originating from fintech. In conclusion, the authors argue that fast-growing modern financial technologies, in addition to the obvious advantages, can seriously threaten economic security of the state, companies, and individuals. A large number of emerging startup companies are a serious competition to traditional banks, offering more favorable terms of service. The introduction of new financial technologies on the one hand simplifies the interaction of consumers with the financial services market and accelerates many processes, but at the same time it makes the financial system much more vulnerable. To neutralize the identified threats arising from the introduction of new financial technologies, the authors propose measures improving the blockchain system, ensuring accessibility of data about individuals conducting operations with cryptocurrencies to law enforcement agencies, development and implementation of fundamentally new systems of protection against advanced persistent threat cyberattacks, training the personnel in the field of cybersecurity, and the introduction of new remote identification technologies in all areas of financial services.",

A significant challenge in developing these defenses is that the space of security vulnerabilities and exploits is large and not fully understood. This results in specific point defenses that aim to patch particular vulnerabilities. While these defenses are valuable, they are often blindsided by fresh attacks that exploit new vulnerabilities. This article aims to address this issue by suggesting ways to make future defenses more durable based on an organization of security vulnerabilities as they arise throughout the program life cycle. We classify these vulnerability sources through programming, compilation, and hardware realization, and we show how each source introduces unintended states and transitions into the implementation. Further, we show how security exploits gain control by moving the implementation to an unintended state using knowledge of these sources and how defenses work to prevent these transitions. This framework of analyzing vulnerability sources, exploits, and defenses provides insights into developing durable defenses that could defend against broader categories of exploits. We present illustrative case studies of four important attack genealogies—showing how they fit into the presented framework and how the sophistication of the exploits and defenses have evolved over time, providing us insights for the future.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain protocols come with a variety of security guarantees. For example, BFT-inspired protocols such as Algorand tend to be secure in the partially synchronous setting, while longest chain protocols like Bitcoin will normally require stronger synchronicity to be secure. Another fundamental distinction, directly relevant to scalability solutions such as sharding, is whether or not a single untrusted user is able to point to certificates, which provide incontrovertible proof of block confirmation. Algorand produces such certificates, while Bitcoin does not. Are these properties accidental? Or are they inherent consequences of the paradigm of protocol design? Our aim in this paper is to understand what, fundamentally, governs the nature of security for permissionless blockchain protocols. Using the framework developed in [12], we prove general results showing that these questions relate directly to properties of the user selection process, i.e. the method (such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake) which is used to select users with the task of updating state. Our results suffice to establish, for example, that the production of certificates is impossible for proof-of-work protocols, but is automatic for standard forms of proof-of-stake protocols. As a byproduct of our work, we also define a number of security notions and identify the equivalences and inequivalences among them.",

        "abstract": "To provide secure content delivery, Transport Layer Security (TLS) has become a de facto standard over a couple of decades. However, TLS has a long history of security weaknesses and drawbacks. Thus, the security of TLS has been enhanced by addressing security problems through continuous version upgrades. Meanwhile, to provide fast content delivery globally, websites (or origin web servers) need to deploy and administer many machines in globally distributed environments. They often delegate the management of machines to web hosting services or content delivery networks (CDNs), where the security configurations of distributed servers may vary spatially depending on the managing entities or locations. Based on these spatial differences in TLS security, we find that the security level of TLS connections (and their web services) can be lowered. After collecting the information of (web) domains that exhibit different TLS versions and cryptographic options depending on clients' locations, we show that it is possible to redirect TLS handshake messages to weak TLS servers, which both the origin server and the client may not be aware of. We investigate 7M domains with these spatial differences of security levels in the wild and conduct the analyses to better understand the root causes of this phenomenon. We also measure redirection delays at various locations in the world to see whether there are noticeable delays in redirections.",

        "abstract": "The ACME certificate issuance and management protocol, standardized as IETF RFC 8555, is an essential element of the web public key infrastructure (PKI). It has been used by Let's Encrypt and other certification authorities to issue over a billion certificates, and a majority of HTTPS connections are now secured with certificates issued through ACME. Despite its importance, however, the security of ACME has not been studied at the same level of depth as other protocol standards like TLS 1.3 or OAuth. Prior formal analyses of ACME only considered the cryptographic core of early draft versions of ACME, ignoring many security-critical low-level details that play a major role in the 100 page RFC, such as recursive data structures, long-running sessions with asynchronous sub-protocols, and the issuance for certificates that cover multiple domains. We present the first in-depth formal security analysis of the ACME standard. Our model of ACME is executable and comprehensive, with a level of detail that lets our ACME client interoperate with other ACME servers. We prove the security of this model using a recent symbolic protocol analysis framework called DY⋆, which in turn is based on the F⋆ programming language. Our analysis accounts for all prior attacks on ACME in the literature, including both cryptographic attacks and low-level attacks on stateful protocol execution. To analyze ACME, we extend DY⋆ with authenticated channels, key substitution attacks, and a concrete execution framework, which are of independent interest. Our security analysis of ACME totaling over 16,000 lines of code is one of the largest proof developments for a cryptographic protocol standard in the literature, and it serves to provide formal security assurances for a crucial component of web security.",

To let IoT devices be able to securely connect to blockchain services, a design based on blockchain SDK proxy node is proposed. The blockchain SDK proxy node runs the blockchain SDK client. IoT devices just need to construct and sign the blockchain transactions, then send the signed data through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided by the proxy node. The proxy node forwards the data to the blockchain network. However, a static proxy node will become the single point of performance bottleneck and failure, which is vulnerable for DDoS attacks.

In this paper, we report our work on developing several machine learning based classifiers for detecting cyber security related accounts on Twitter, including a base-line classifier for detecting cyber security related accounts in general, and three sub-classifiers for detecting three subsets of cyber security related accounts (individuals, hackers, and academia). To train and test the classifiers, we followed a more systemic approach (based on a cyber security taxonomy, real-time sampling of tweets, and crowdsourcing) to construct a dataset of cyber security related accounts with multiple tags assigned to each account. For each classifier, we considered a richer set of features than those used in past studies. Among five machine learning models tested, the Random Forest model achieved the best performance: 93% for the baseline classifier, 88-91% for the three sub-classifiers. We also studied feature reduction of the base-line classifier and showed that using just six features we can already achieve the same performance.",

We report on a Grounded Theory study of the role of coordination in security patch management. The reported theory consists of four inter-related dimensions, i.e., causes, breakdowns, constraints, and mechanisms. The theory explains the causes that define the need for coordination among interdependent software/hardware components and multiple stakeholders’ decisions, the constraints that can negatively impact coordination, the breakdowns in coordination, and the potential corrective measures. This study provides potentially useful insights for researchers and practitioners who can carefully consider the needs of and devise suitable solutions for supporting the coordination of interdependencies involved in security patch management.",

        "abstract": "Motivation: Recent efforts to expand K-12 computer science education highlight the great need for well-prepared computer science (CS) teachers. Teacher identity theory offers a particular conceptual lens for us to understand computer science teacher preparation and professional development. The emerging literature suggests that teacher identity is central to sustaining motivation, efficacy, job satisfaction, and commitment, and these attributes are crucial in determining teacher retention. While the benefits associated with a strong sense of teacher identity are great, teachers face unique challenges and tensions in developing their professional identity for teaching computer science. Objectives: This exploratory study attempts to operationalize computer science teacher identity through discussing the potential domains, proposing and testing a quantitative instrument for assessing computer science teachers’ professional identity. Method: We first discussed the potential domains of computer science teacher identity based on recent teacher identity literature and considerations on some unique challenges for computer science teachers. Then we proposed the computer science teacher identity scale, which was piloted through a national K-12 computer science teacher survey with 3,540 completed responses. The survey results were analyzed with a series of factor analyses to test the internal structure of the computer science teacher identity scale. Results: Our analyses reveal a four-factor solution for the computer science teacher identity scale, which is composed of CS teaching commitment, CS pedagogical confidence, confidence to engage students, and sense of community/belonging. There were significant differences among the teachers with different computer science teaching experiences. In general, teachers with more computer science teaching experience had higher computer science teacher identity scores on all four factors. Discussion: The four-factor model along with a large national dataset invites a deeper analysis of the data and can provide important benchmarks. Such an instrument can be used to explore developmental patterns in computer science teacher identity, and function as a pedagogical tool to provoke discussion and reflection among teachers about their professional development. This study may also contribute to understanding computer science teachers’ professional development needs and inform efforts to prepare, develop, and retain computer science teachers.",

        "abstract": "Digital technology provides unique opportunities to revolutionize the healthcare ecosystem and health research. However, this comes with serious security, safety, and privacy threats. The healthcare sector has been proven unequipped and unready to face cyberattacks while its vulnerabilities are being systematically exploited by attackers. The growing need and use of medical devices and smart equipment, the complexity of operations and the incompatible systems are leaving healthcare organizations exposed to various malware, including ransomware, which result in compromised healthcare access, quality, safety and care. To fully benefit from the advantages of technology, cybersecurity issues need to be resolved. Cybersecurity measures are being suggested via a number of healthcare standards which are often contradicting and confusing, making these measures ineffective and difficult to implement. To place a solid foundation for the healthcare sector, in improving the understanding of complex cybersecurity issues, this paper explores the existing vulnerabilities in the health care critical information infrastructures which are used in cyberattacks and discusses the reasons why this sector is under attack. Furthermore, the existing security standards in healthcare are presented alongside with their implementation challenges. The paper also discusses the use of living labs as a novel way to discover how to practically implement cybersecurity measures and also provides a set of recommendations as future steps. Finally, to our knowledge this is the first paper that analyses security in the context of living labs and provides suggestions relevant to this context.",

This paper studies the role of information in the security problem when the target information is sold by a data broker to multiple attackers. We formulate a novel multi-stage game model to characterize both the cooperative and competitive interactions of the data broker and attackers. The attackers&#x2019; competition with correlated purchasing and attacking decisions is modeled as a two-stage stochastic model, and the bargaining process between the data broker and the attackers is analyzed in a Stackelberg game. The study contributes to the literature by exploring the behaviors of the attackers with labor specialization, and providing quantitative measures of information value from an economic perspective. The proposed frameworks characterize both the attackers&#x2019; competitive equilibrium solutions and the data broker&#x2019;s pricing strategies under different market parameters. We also show how factors such as the quality of information, the heterogeneity in attackers&#x2019; utilities, and their cooperative purchasing strategy would have an impact on the results.",

We then formalize various suitable components, which we use to obtain full-fledged ZK protocols for general relations. We compare two approaches for obtaining verified executable implementations. The first uses a fully automated extraction from EasyCrypt to OCaml. The second reduces the trusted computing base (TCB) and provides better performance by combining code extraction with formally verified manual low-level components implemented in the Jasmin language. We conclude with a discussion of the trade-off between the formal verification effort and the performance of resulting executables, and how our approach opens the way for fully verified implementations of state-of the-art optimized protocols based on MitH.",

Studies show that it is better to think about these challenges during a software development process. Many ideas and approaches exist in the research community that define these challenges as goals within a software development process. In addition, major companies have published their own software development processes and methods addressing these goals in part. But major companies have very different work conditions compared to a work setting faced by an App-Developer (AD), a Small and Medium Company (SMC) and the Open Source Community (OSC) respectively. This leads us to the question: Are work settings of ADs, SMCs, or the OSCs considered sufficiently by research in order to make software development processes with special focus on security, usability and privacy goals work? Therefore we performed a literature review in order to investigate the current state of research. Using an appropriate query, publications relevant for our question were identified and categorised by two independent reviewers.  Our work shows that there are some publications proposing software processes supporting usability goals and taking work settings into account. We were not able to identify any contribution that proposes a software development process which addresses privacy, usability and security goals together and differentiates the work setting of ADs or as found in SMCs and in OSCs respectively.",

This article comprehensively summarizes the latest research on adversarial attacks against security solutions based on machine learning techniques and illuminates the risks they pose. First, the adversarial attack methods are characterized based on their stage of occurrence, and the attacker’ s goals and capabilities. Then, we categorize the applications of adversarial attack and defense methods in the cyber security domain. Finally, we highlight some characteristics identified in recent research and discuss the impact of recent advancements in other adversarial learning domains on future research directions in the cyber security domain. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to discuss the unique challenges of implementing end-to-end adversarial attacks in the cyber security domain, map them in a unified taxonomy, and use the taxonomy to highlight future research directions.",

Recently, a large volume of phishing attacks transit toward adopting HTTPS, leveraging TLS certificates issued from Certificate Authorities (CAs), to make the attacks more effective. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the security practices of CAs in the HTTPS phishing ecosystem. We focus on the CAs, critical actors under-studied in previous literature, to better understand the importance of the security practices of CAs and thwart the proliferating HTTPS phishing. In particular, we first present the current landscape and effectiveness of HTTPS phishing attacks comparing to traditional HTTP ones. Then, we conduct an empirical experiment on the CAs' security practices in terms of the issuance and revocation of the certificates. Our findings highlight serious conflicts between the expected security practices of CAs and reality, raising significant security concerns. We further validate our findings using a longitudinal dataset of abusive certificates used for real phishing attacks in the wild. We confirm that the security concerns of CAs prevail in the wild and these concerns can be one of the main contributors to the recent surge of HTTPS phishing attacks.",

Security is one of the main focuses in the development of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, a Hybrid Cryptography security mechanism was implemented using an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm to carry out a data security mechanism and a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) to ensure data integrity. Security testing is done by performing brute force and man-in-the-middle attacks. The results show that the system can determine the attacker's data changes and overcome the brute force attack carried out for 50 hours. The average time needed to perform the encryption process is 409 μs, and it takes an average of 7304 μs to do the decryption process.",

In order to improve the power grid enterprises' perception of the energy consumption status of users, a monitoring and early warning method for grid users' energy consumption based on multiple data perception is proposed. First, by collecting energy consumption monitoring data, multiple data perception characteristics are obtained, and the intrusion behavior sample data processing is performed in combination with the working condition characteristics of the energy consumption equipment. Subsequently, the fuzzy monitoring method is used to control the abnormal data according to the set authority threshold, and the monitoring and early warning level is set accordingly. Finally, the combination of multi-attention and GRU (Gate Recurrent Unit) is used to construct the security protection warning model, so as to realize state safety monitoring and early warning. The simulation result showed that this method further improved the system's monitoring and early warning accuracy by improving the multiple perception capabilities of the collected data.",

In 2008, in order to manage mobility, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed Proxy Mobile IPv6, which is a network-based mobility management protocol to support seamless connectivity of mobile devices. This protocol can play a key role in volunteer computing paradigms as a user can seamlessly access computing resources. The procedure of user authentication is not defined in this standard; thus, many studies have been carried out to propose suitable authentication schemes. However, in the current authentication methods, with reduced latency and packet loss, some security and privacy considerations are neglected. In this study, we propose a secure and anonymous ticket-based authentication (SATA) method to protect mobile nodes against existing security and privacy issues. The proposed method reduces the overhead of handover authentication procedures using the ticket-based concept. We evaluated security and privacy strengths of the proposed method using security theorems and BAN logic.",

Supporting each channel is a management framework integrated in the device and provided by different parties. For example, a device that integrates Apple HomeKit framework can be managed by Apple Home app. We call the management framework of this kind, including all its device- and cloud-side components, a device management channel (DMC). 4 third-party DMCs are widely integrated in today's IoT devices along with the device manufacturer's own DMC: HomeKit, Zigbee/Z-Wave compatible DMC, and smart-speaker Seamless DMC. Each of these DMCs is a standalone system that has full mandate on the device; however, if their security policies and control are not aligned, consequences can be serious, allowing a malicious user to utilize one DMC to bypass the security control imposed by the device owner on another DMC. We call such a problem Chaotic Device Management (Codema). This paper presents the first systematic study on Codema, based on a new model-guided approach. We purchased and analyzed 14 top-rated IoT devices and their integration and management of multiple DMCs. We found that Codema is both general and fundamental: these DMCs are generally not designed to coordinate with each other for security policies and control. The Codema problems enable the adversary to practically gain unauthorized access to sensitive devices (e.g., locks, garage doors, etc.). We reported our findings to affected parties (e.g., Apple, August, Philips Hue, ismartgate, Abode), which all acknowledged their importance. To mitigate this new threat, we designed and implemented CGuard, a new access control framework that device manufacturers can easily integrate into their IoT devices to protect end users. Our evaluation shows that CGuard is highly usable and acceptable to users, easy to adopt by manufacturers, and efficient and effective in security control.",

In 2012, a study conducted in the US found differences in how participants perceive their devices’ (laptop vs. smartphone) security and privacy. At the time, smartphones were still relatively new, and the participants had significantly less trust in their smartphones compared to laptops. Since then, smartphones and computers have improved a lot in soft- and hardware, and people are now much more familiar with smartphones in general. To understand the current state and the development of device perception, we repeated the original study in Germany, with minor adaptions, as online interviews with 30 participants. While the US study suggested security concerns limit smartphone usage, we did not find significant differences that would restrict the use of smartphones today.

        "abstract": "Ensuring security for the next-generation of millimeter-Wave and Terahertz networks, while simultaneously ensuring multi-Gbps data rates and ultra-low latency (sub-millisecond) is becoming increasingly challenging. Physical layer security that exploits the physics of wireless propagation to incorporate security features into the signal is becoming increasingly popular as a component for a holistic approach towards ensuring security. In this regard, there are prior works that have exposed severe vulnerabilities in the well-established principle of security that involve directional narrow beams. In this article we highlight security features using mm-Wave interface design, and present a generalized approach towards physical-layer security. Security in our approach is ensured by enforcing fundamental loss of information by selective spectral aliasing towards the direction of eavesdroppers while maintaining robust, high fidelity wireless link towards the intended receiver. In a custom-designed integrated transmitter array, spectral aliasing is achieved by dynamically reconfigurable symbol-to-antenna mapping principle that can synthesize a fast time-varying channel towards the direction of the eavesdroppers. We demonstrate this principle experimentally for the first time with mm-Wave directional links (71-76 GHz unlicensed spectrum). We also experimentally show the resilience of such links against distributed and synchronized eavesdropper attacks for the first time in the mm-Wave bands.",

For the most part, automated analyses have been confined to IoT hub or gateway devices, which tend to feature traditional operating systems such as Linux or VxWorks. However, most IoT peripherals, by their very nature of being resource-constrained, lacking traditional operating systems, implementing a wide variety of communication technologies, and (increasingly) featuring the ARM Cortex-M architecture, have only been the subject of smaller-scale analyses, typically confined to a certain class or brand of device. We bridge this gap with argXtract, a framework for performing automated static analysis of stripped Cortex-M binaries, to enable bulk extraction of security-relevant configuration data. Through a case study of 200+ Bluetooth Low Energy binaries targeting Nordic Semiconductor chipsets, as well as smaller studies against STMicroelectronics BlueNRG binaries and Nordic ANT binaries, argXtract has discovered widespread security and privacy issues in IoT, including minimal or no protection for data, weakened pairing mechanisms, and potential for device and user tracking.",

However, many of the current power data sets have serious problems of data island; furthermore, the centralized storage of large amounts of data may cause privacy leakage of the original data owners and faces regulations of security supervision. Therefore, federated learning is introduced to address these issues. Nevertheless, this approach is not sufficient to provide adequate data privacy protection. The present research proposes a federated learning model based on improved differential privacy algorithm. The model uses multi-scale Laplacian algorithm to analyze data distribution and generate noises in accordance with data patterns. Moreover, the parameters of the model are protected by attribute-based access control (ABAC). The simulation results show that the model proposed by the present research makes accurate forecasting and the improved differential privacy algorithm has less influence on the model's accuracy; the model also shows a good resistance to attacks, which ensures the security of data while having a high precision.",

Due to the open propagation property of electromagnetic signals as well as the non-encrypted Qi communication channel, we demonstrate that the Qi communication established between the charger (i.e., a charging pad) and the charging device (i.e., a smartphone) could be non-intrusively interfered with and eavesdropped. In particular, we build two types of attacks: 1) Hijacking Attack: through stealthily placing an ultra-thin adversarial coil on the wireless charger’s surface, we show that an adversary is capable of hijacking the communication channel via injecting malicious Qi messages to further control the entire charging process as they desire; and 2) Eavesdropping Attack: by sticking an adversarial coil underneath the surface (e.g., a table) on which the charger is placed, the adversary can eavesdrop Qi messages and further infer the device’s running activities while it is being charged. We validate these proof-of-concept attacks using multiple commodity smartphones and 14 commonly used calling and messaging apps. The results show that our designed hijacking attack can cause overcharging, undercharging, and paused charging, etc., potentially leading to more significant damage to the battery (e.g., overheating, reducing battery life, or explosion). In addition, the designed eavesdropping attack can achieve a high accuracy in detecting and identifying the running app activities (e.g., over 95.56% and 85.80% accuracy for calling apps and messaging apps, respectively). Our work brings to light a fundamental design vulnerability in the currently-deployed wireless charging architecture, which may put people’s security and privacy at risk while wirelessly recharging their smartphones.",

To evaluate the Police Office Model adaptation effect, we conduct an empirical study using custom software simulation environment. As performance metrics, the time to perform task assigned to the agents, and the number of tasks performed over one iteration were used.

However, in the course of discussions, the issue of criminalizing computer crimes, the growth of which is poorly controllable, is overlooked. The increased public danger of illegal activities of legal entities is also associated with the fact that they are often created and serve as a means of committing economic, environmental and other crimes. The issue of criminal liability of legal entities has been resolved in many countries of the world and is recorded in international documents. For this reason, the author's goal is a research analysis of the main threats to the information security of legal entities in Russia and the development of ways to ensure it. Taking into account the widespread use of legal entities in the commission of economic and other crimes, the author, based on the analysis of statistics and comparative research of foreign experience and the insufficient effectiveness of the measures taken to combat computer crime in Russia, proposed the introduction of criminal liability against legal entities for committing computer crimes.",

The method (named EASG) is general and largely game-independent, which allows for its application to a wide range of SGs with only slight adjustments. The efficacy of EASG is verified on 3 types of games from different domains: patrolling, surveillance, and cybersecurity. Comprehensive experiments performed on more than $300$ test games demonstrate robustness and stability of EASG, manifested by repetitively achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions. The main advantage of EASG compared to alternative approaches to solving SGs is its time efficiency. EASG finds high-quality solutions with approximately linear time scalability and can therefore be applied to solving SG instances which are beyond capabilities of the state-of-the-art exact methods. Due to anytime characteristics, EASG is particularly well suited for time-critical applications.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system invented by Nakamoto in 2008. While it has attracted much research interest, its exact latency and security properties remain open. Existing analyses provide security and latency (or confirmation time) guarantees that are too loose for practical use. In fact the best known upper bounds are several orders of magnitude larger than a lower bound due to a well-known private-mining attack. This paper describes a continuous-time model for blockchains and develops a rigorous analysis that yields close upper and lower bounds for the latency-security trade-off. For example, when the adversary controls 10% of the total mining power and the block propagation delays are within 10 seconds, a Bitcoin block is secured with less than 10-3 error probability if it is confirmed after four hours, or with less than 10-9 error probability if confirmed after ten hours. These confirmation times are about two hours away from their corresponding lower bounds. To establish such close bounds, the blockchain security question is reduced to a race between the Poisson adversarial mining process and a renewal process formed by a certain species of honest blocks. The moment generation functions of relevant renewal times are derived in closed form. The general formulas from the analysis are then applied to study the latency-security trade-off of several well-known proof-of-work longest-chain cryptocurrencies. Guidance is also provided on how to set parameters for different purposes.",

The presented work extends the Sifu platform with challenges addressing Terraform-aided cloud deployment on Amazon Web Services.

Furthermore, this paper quantifies the challenges’ perceived usefulness and impact, by evaluating the challenges among a total of twelve participants. Our preliminary results show that the challenges are suitable for education and the industry, with potential usage in internal training. A key finding is that, although the participants understand the importance of secure coding, their answers indicate that universities leave them unprepared in this area.

While this network design yields several benefits, we demonstrate that the use of popular counter mode encryption modes like CTR or GCM can show substantial shortcomings in terms of security when used in conjunction with this network design. In particular, we show how the use of authenticated encryption using GCM enables the possibility of establishing a subliminal channel by exploiting the authentication information within messages. We show how decoding of hidden information can proceed in addition to decryption of overt information without raising authentication failures.  With an exemplary but typical infrastructure, we show how the subliminal channel might be exploited and discuss approaches to mitigating the threat by preventing the ability to embed hidden information. In contrast to previous work, we conclude that, when using an infrastructure involving a CKMD and GCM is deployed, the use of random, CKMD-generated Initialization Vectors (IVs) is beneficial to avoid the subliminal channel described in this paper. However, the most potent remedy is deploying a different operational mode like GCM-SIV.",

Bangladesh is constantly seeking sustainable energy sources for securing its increasing energy demand as energy security is a national concern. Currently, Bangladesh is producing 64% of electricity using natural gas while 25% is coming from petroleum and the rest from coal, renewable sources [1]. To reduce pressure from the natural gas government is trying to diversify the energy sources. To achieve sustainable diversified energy sources, the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) has taken many initiatives. Energy Master Plan has been created which targets to improve Primary Energy consumption per GDP by 20% in the year 2030. Many software applications have been developed by SREDA to monitor the progress. We propose to develop another system for energy data analysis and generate reports accordingly. Policymakers can use those reports to make strategic decisions to secure the country's energy consumption, distribution and manage the demand side. In this research work, we discussed how a big data-based solution can be developed and used to forecast the energy balance which ensures the energy security of Bangladesh.

A survey study designed to test the model and hypotheses reveals that the effects of affordances on ISI professionals' intentions to use and collaborate are mediated by perceived usefulness and ease of use, which then jointly determine their perceived value. This study advances ISI research by specifying three important affordances of OADRs; it also contributes to extant technology adoption literature by scrutinizing and affirming the interplay of essential user acceptance and value perceptions to explain ISI professionals' adoptions of OADRs.",

Next, a private information storage platform is built by using blockchain technology, and information transmission is realized using standard cryptographic algorithms. In this process, file authorization contracts are also used to guarantee the security of private information and further prevent theft of medical private information. Our simulation results show that the storage response time of this method is kept below 1,000 ms, and the maximum information throughput rate reaches 550 kbit/s, which indicates that this method has strong performance in information storage and transmission efficiency. Moreover, the reliability and bandwidth utilization of data transmission across domains is higher, so the method has higher information security control performance and superior overall performance.",

Based on the analysis of load loss probability and expected response characteristics of insufficient packet loss load in communication transmission, the reliability index calculation system of low-delay cluster scheduling communication network node scheduling is established. By introducing expected load reduction parameters, the frequency characteristics of node scheduling security in low-delay cluster scheduling communication network are monitored.

The network transmission load control is carried out by using grey correlation scheduling model.

The learning control of node security situation assessment is realized by using Cyber-net and unsupervised learning methods.

Security is “end-to-end” in the sense that the attacker can attack all parts of the system, including all communication links and any subset of parties (servers, devices, client terminals), can learn users’ passwords, and perform active and passive attacks, online and offline. In all cases the scheme provides the highest attainable security bounds given the set of compromised components. Our solution builds a TFA scheme using any Device-enhanced Password-authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE), defined by Jarecki et al., and any Short Authenticated String (SAS) Message Authentication, defined by Vaudenay. We show an efficient instantiation of this modular construction, which utilizes any password-based client-server authentication method, with or without reliance on public-key infrastructure. The security of the proposed scheme is proven in a formal model that we formulate as an extension of the traditional PAKE model. We also report on a prototype implementation of our schemes, including TLS-based and PKI-free variants, as well as several instantiations of the SAS mechanism, all demonstrating the practicality of our approach. Finally, we present a usability study evaluating the viability of our protocol contrasted with the traditional PIN-based TFA approach in terms of efficiency, potential for errors, user experience, and security perception of the underlying manual process.1",

Although this achieves user-friendliness by avoiding the constant switching between the subject app and the system built-in browser apps, we find that IABIs, if not well designed or customized, could result in usability security risks.  In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study on the usability (in)security of in-app browsing interfaces in both Android and iOS apps. Specifically, we collect a dataset of 25 high-profile mobile apps from five common application categories that contain IABIs, including Facebook and Gmail, and perform a systematic analysis (not end-user study though) that comprises eight carefully designed security tests and covers the entire course of opening, displaying, and navigating an in-app web page. During this process, we obtain three major security findings: (1) about 30% of the tested apps fail to provide enough URL information for users to make informed decisions on opening an URL; (2) nearly all custom IABIs have various problems in providing sufficient indicators to faithfully display an in-app page to users, whereas ten IABIs that are based on Chrome Custom Tabs and SFSafariViewController are generally secure; and (3) only a few IABIs give warnings to remind users of the risk of inputting passwords during navigating a (potentially phishing) login page.  Most developers had acknowledged our findings but their willingness and readiness to fix usability issues are rather low compared to fixing technical vulnerabilities, which is a puzzle in usability security research. Nevertheless, to help mitigate risky IABIs and guide future designs, we propose a set of secure IABI design principles.",

In this paper we explore the possibility of physical layer key generation for emerging Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) such as LoRa (Long Range). However, due to the lower transmission rates of LPWANs compared to Wi-Fi and Zigbee, the channel reciprocity is relatively low, which makes timely key generation challenging. To address this problem, we propose a novel information-theoretic key generation scheme that can operate at all data rate settings, featuring a model-based key generation method. Furthermore, we derive an optimal window size to calculate the parameters of the channel model based on a random waypoint model to balance the channel reciprocity and entropy. Extensive evaluations on a campus testbed show that our method can achieve up to 13.8 bps key generation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method improves key generation rate by 3x to 5x. We also analyzed the security of the proposed approach and demonstrated it to be resilient to eavesdropping attacks.",

Initiatives must be enacted with respect to the security and privacy of the consuming public for the protection of our individual PII (Personally Identifiable Identification).

As these technological capabilities arrive upon the consuming public, with lessening non-IoT related options available, such introductions could or perhaps will all but eliminate any freedom of voluntary participatory IoT use.

As potential dangers will appear in multiple forms, but will not necessarily be limited to familiar forms and now known instances of cyber intrusions, the introduction of malware, ransomware, potential identity theft or obfuscation, and/or cyber-attacks should be acknowledged and expected to evolve. As the technology evolves, we should expect that the attacks and dangers will also evolve, as they have already begun to do so. If we are to be vigilant, efforts must be made to develop, enact and initiate effective, appropriate safeguards, protections, remedies or mitigations to hopefully guard against these inevitable IoT intrusions and violations.",

        "abstract": "Managing digital privacy and security is often a collaborative process, where groups of individuals work together to share information and give one another advice. Yet, this collaborative process is not always reciprocal or equally shared. In many cases, individuals with more expertise help others without receiving help in return. Therefore, we studied the phenomenon of \"Tech Caregiving\" by surveying 20 groups (112 individuals) comprised of friends, family members, and/or co-workers who identified at least one member of their group as a someone who provides informal technical support to the people they know. We found that tech caregivers reported significantly higher levels of power use and self-efficacy for digital privacy and security, compared to tech caregivees. However, caregivers and caregivees did not differ based on their self-reportedcommunity collective-efficacy for collaboratively managing privacy and security together as a group. This finding demonstrates the importance of tech caregiving and community belonging in building community collective efficacy for digital privacy and security. We also found that caregivers and caregivees most often communicated via text message or phone when coordinating support, which was most frequently needed when troubleshooting or setting up new devices. Meanwhile, discussions specific to privacy and security represented only a small fraction of the issues for which participants gave or received tech care. Thus, we conclude that educating tech caregivers on how to provide privacy and security-focused support, as well as designing technologies that facilitate such support, has the potential to create positive networks effects towards the collective management of digital privacy and security.",

On the other hand, a strong and secure scheme is needed to provide user authentication based on a smart card. Several schemes have been proposed, one of them is Lee's scheme proposed in 2015 [1]. However, based on Jung et al. analysis 2015[2], Lee's scheme has several weaknesses against impersonation and off-line password guessing attack. Moreover, the scheme is also failed to preserve user anonymity. This research proposed an improvement scheme to strengthen Lee's scheme [1]. For strengthening Lee's scheme, the proposed scheme uses Zero Knowledge and keyed hash function. The proposed scheme introduces an additional phase for generating a session key for securing the communication between two parties each other. Based on the experiment, it can be concluded that the proposed scheme is stronger than the previous scheme because the probability for breaking the proposed scheme using the off-line password guessing and impersonation attack is less than probability for breaking Lee's scheme.",

        "abstract": "In an electronic voting system, authentication is used to ensure that the voter is legitimate without knowing his/her identity, while the vote collectors verify the data is received from a legitimate user without knowing the identity of the voter. One of the authentication schemes that fulfilled this requirement is called a deniable authentication scheme, where the receiver can prove the source of the message while another party cannot identify the source of the message. In 2013, Li-Takagi et al. proposed a deniable authentication scheme. However, Li-Takagi's scheme has weaknesses if the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. In this case, the third party can identify the source of a given message. In the proposed method, zero-knowledge proof is introduced to preserve the anonymity of the deniable authentication scheme when the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. Based on the analysis, the proposed scheme fulfills the requirement of the deniable authentication scheme when the receiver fully cooperates with the third party. However, the proposed scheme has additional computation costs for securing the shared secret key. Two attack schemes that are carried out on both Li-Takagi and the proposed scheme are the MITM attack and the impersonation attack. The probability of breaking the proposed scheme using an MITM attack is lower than when using Li-Takagi's scheme, but the probability of breaking the proposed scheme using an impersonation attack is the same as Li-Takagi's scheme.",

In this paper we discuss the privacy and security issues of common approaches for constructing digital health passports. We then show how to construct, and deploy, secure and private digital health passports, in a simple and efficient manner. We do so by using a protocol for distributed password-based token issuance, secret sharing and by leveraging modern smart phones’ secure hardware.  Our solution only requires a constant amount of asymmetric cryptographic operations and a single round of communication between the user and the party verifying the user’s digital health passport, and only two rounds between the user and the server issuing the digital health passport.",

Since there is an inordinateness of objectionable content on the internet, the kids might get exposed to this content typically accidentally whereas sometimes intentionally. Therefore, it becomes vital to observe the web activities of kids by the parents. The lack of parental control, guidance & inability of parents to monitor their kids throughout the whole time frame motivated us to style and develop a parental control and management tool. Initially, we conducted a background study to understand the state-of-the-art tools currently available in the market and compare those tools in terms of functionality, accuracy, efficiency, usability, and security. We also studied the benchmark requirements set by the parents and the freedom of access expressed by the children. We have implemented a front-end solution and an Android App that follows the default criteria set by us. As the internet is a highly dynamic space, we have used a Machine Learning-based approach to classify the website dynamically to provide dynamicity to the tool. The very basic idea is to scrape a website's content once the user enters the URL and then apply an appropriate algorithm to classify the same, essentially converting the problem into a multi-class classification problem. The result indicates that our tool efficiently blocks inappropriate content and facilitates parents with features to control and monitor their children's online activity and help mitigate the risk of cyber threats for children of the current age.",

We gathered a corpus of 39664 PDF files published by 75 security agencies from 47 countries. We have been able to measure the quality and quantity of information exposed in these PDF files. It can be effectively used to find weak links in an organization: the employees who are running outdated software. We have also measured the adoption of PDF files sanitization by security agencies. We identified only 7 security agencies which sanitize few of their PDF files before publishing. Unfortunately, we were still able to find sensitive information within 65% of these sanitized PDF files. Some agencies are using weak sanitization techniques: it requires to remove all the hidden sensitive information from the file and not just to remove the data at the surface. Security agencies need to change their sanitization methods.",

However, modeling the system as a single player, as done in prior works in security domain, is insufficient for the system under partial compromise and for the design of finegrained defensive strategies where the rest of the system with autonomy can cooperate to mitigate the impact of attacks. To deal with such issues, we propose a new self-adaptive framework incorporating Bayesian game and model the defender (i.e., the system) at the granularity of components in system architecture. The system architecture model is translated into a Bayesian multiplayer game, where each component is modeled as an independent player while security attacks are encoded as variant types for the components. The defensive strategy for the system is dynamically computed by solving the pure equilibrium to achieve the best possible system utility, improving the resiliency of the system against security attacks.",

We present a novel, end-to-end, automated framework for modeling new attack techniques from the textual description of security vulnerabilities. Given a description of a security vulnerability, the proposed framework first extracts the relevant attack entities required to model the attack, completes missing information on the vulnerability, and derives a new interaction rule that models the attack; this new rule is then integrated within the MulVal attack graph tool. The proposed framework implements a novel data science pipeline that includes a dedicated cybersecurity linguistic model trained on the NVD repository, a recurrent neural network model used for attack entity extraction, a logistic regression model used for completing the missing information, and a transition probability matrix for automatically generating new interaction rule. We evaluated the performance of each of the individual algorithms, as well as the complete framework, and demonstrated its effectiveness.",

SDN presents a centralized and completely dynamic environment which provides flexibility and programmability in networks. It enables the network to be controlled centrally and intelligently using multiple software applications. SDN being in its infancy, brings along new challenges. Standardization of various interfaces, scalability, compatibility of contrasting or divergent networks, and vulnerability issues are few of them. This paper discusses various vulnerabilities and possible attacks on every layer of an SDN and focuses on control plane attacks. Further, it presents a comprehensive survey on numerous attacks on the brain of an SDN i.e. the control plane along with existing solutions. The study concludes that despite the challenges that are worth debating, SDN has many characteristics that make it an ideal candidate for future networks.",

        "abstract": "Limited by the small keyboard, most mobile apps support the automatic login feature for better user experience. Therefore, users avoid the inconvenience of retyping their ID and password when an app runs in the foreground again. However, this auto-login function can be exploited to launch the so-called \"data-clone attack\": once the locally-stored, auto-login depended data are cloned by attackers and placed into their own smartphones, attackers can break through the login-device number limit and log in to the victim's account stealthily. A natural countermeasure is to check the consistency of device-specific attributes. As long as the new device shows different device fingerprints with the previous one, the app will disable the auto-login function and thus prevent data-clone attacks. In this paper, we develop VPDroid, a transparent Android OS-level virtualization platform tailored for security testing. With VPDroid, security analysts can customize different device artifacts, such as CPU model, Android ID, and phone number, in a virtual phone without user-level API hooking. VPDroid's isolation mechanism ensures that user-mode apps in the virtual phone cannot detect device-specific discrepancies. To assess Android apps' susceptibility to the data-clone attack, we use VPDroid to simulate data-clone attacks with 234 most-downloaded apps. Our experiments on five different virtual phone environments show that VPDroid's device attribute customization can deceive all tested apps that perform device-consistency checks, such as Twitter, WeChat, and PayPal. 19 vendors have confirmed our report as a zero-day vulnerability. Our findings paint a cautionary tale: only enforcing a device-consistency check at client side is still vulnerable to an advanced data-clone attack.",

We build on the EBRM architecture and construct a Blockchain-Based Root Management (BBRM) to provide even greater decentralization and security. More specifically, BBRM uses blockchain to i) replace the existing RCA and have the electors directly involved in the root certificate generation, ii) control the elector network membership including elector addition and revocation, and iii) provide greater accountability and transparency on the aforementioned functionalities. We implement BBRM on Hyperledger Fabric using smart contract for system experimentation and analyses. Our experiments show that BBRM is lightweight in processing, efficient in ledger size, and supports a bandwidth of multiple transactions per second. Our results show that the BBRM blockchain is appropriate for the root certificate generation and the elector membership control for EBRM within SCMS, which are significantly smaller in number and occurrences than the SCMS outputs of vehicle certificates.

If an attacker can manipulate the automated processing, the results can be devastating and in the worst case lead to wrong diagnosis and treatment. In this research, the goal is to demonstrate the use of one-pixel attacks in a real-life scenario with a real pathology dataset, TUPAC16, which consists of digitized whole-slide images. We attack against the IBM CODAIT's MAX breast cancer detector using adversarial images. These adversarial examples are found using differential evolution to perform the one-pixel modification to the images in the dataset. The results indicate that a minor one-pixel modification of a whole slide image under analysis can affect the diagnosis by reversing the automatic diagnosis result. The attack poses a threat from the cyber security perspective: the one-pixel method can be used as an attack vector by a motivated attacker.",

The main objectives of our research are looking into the evolution of cybercrime new trends of online payments and detection, more precisely the usage of mobile phones, and describing methodologies for digital trace identification in data flows for potential online payment fraud. The paper aims to identify potential actions for identity theft while conducting the Reconnaissance step of the kill chain, and documenting a forensic methodology for guidance and further data collection for law enforcement bodies. Moreover, a secondary objective of the paper is to identify, from a user’s perspective, transparency issues of data sharing among involved parties for online payments. We thus declare the transparency analysis as the incident triggering a forensic examination. Hence, we devise a semi-automated traffic analysis approach, based on previous work, to examine data flows, and data exchanged among parties in online payments. For this, the main steps are segmenting traffic generated by the process payment, and other sources, subsequently, identifying data streams in the process. We conduct three tests which include three different payment gateways: PayPal, Klarna-sofort, and Amazon Pay. The experiment setup requires circumventing TLS encryption for the correct identification of forensic data types in TCP/IP traffic, and potential data leaks. However, it requires no extensive expertise in mobile security for its installation. In the results, we identified some important security vulnerabilities from some payment APIs that pose financial and privacy risks to the marketplace’s customers.",

The algorithm classifies the states of adjacent nodes, and then realizes attack detection through Bayesian criterion. An adaptive detection threshold is proposed to improve the detection performance. The reliable information of the last time is used to replace the detected lossy information and fuse to ensure the performance of the algorithm.

Their tasks of monitoring, analyzing, and communicating threats and incidents is getting more complex due to the increasing amount of information disseminated into public channels.

        "abstract": "Competitive coevolution is an important technique for fields such as defense and security which inherently involve adversarial games. One advantage that the field of computer security has in particular is that games in this space are often naturally able to be simulated at a high fidelity by interacting with the involved software or hardware directly. However, such high-fidelity evaluations are typically slow, so it is especially important in these cases to get as much useful information out of as few evaluations as possible. This paper proposes a new competitive coevolutionary evaluation method of Similar-Strength Opponent Sampling, which selects opponent pairings of similar skill levels so that evaluations can more efficiently distinguish the performances of similar individuals. This is enabled through the use of Elo ratings as a surrogate fitness function that prevents bias against individuals assigned stronger opponents. Care is taken to ensure that this technique is applicable to complex games where there is no explicit winner or loser, allowing ratings to be based on relative fitness. Mixed results are presented, showing that significant benefits are gained from pairing similar-strength opponents, but finding that the use of Elo rating instead of raw fitness harms evolution for intransitive games.",

To protect Intellectual Property (IPs) from theft and reverse-engineering, multiple obfuscation methods have been developed. An essential component of such schemes is the need for secrecy and authenticity of the obfuscation keys. Such keys may need to be exchanged through the unprotected channels, and their recovery attempted using side-channel attacks. However, the use of the current AES-GCM standard to protected key exchange requires a substantial area and power overhead. NIST is currently coordinating a standardization process to select lightweight algorithms for resource-constrained applications. Although security against cryptanalysis is paramount, cost, performance, and resistance to side-channel attacks are among the most important selection criteria. Since the cost of protection against side-channel attacks is a function of the algorithm, quantifying this cost is necessary for estimating its cost and performance in real-world applications. In this work, we investigate side-channel resistant lightweight implementations of an authenticated cipher TinyJAMBU, one of ten finalists in the current NIST LWC standardization process. Our results demonstrate that these implementations achieve robust security against side-channel attacks while keeping the area and power consumption significantly lower than it is possible using the current standards.",

To compensate for the limited resources on the IoT devices, the computation-intensive image classification tasks are often offloaded to remote cloud services. However, the offloading-based image classification could pose significant security and privacy concerns to the user data and the DNN model, leading to effective adversarial attacks that compromise the classification accuracy. The existing defense methods either impact the original functionality or result in high computation or model re-training overhead. In this paper, we develop a novel defense approach, namely Fake Gradient, to protect the privacy of the data and defend against adversarial attacks based on encryption of the output. Fake Gradient can hide the real output information by generating fake classes and further mislead the adversarial perturbation generation based on fake gradient knowledge, which helps maintain a high classification accuracy on the perturbed data. Our evaluations using ImageNet and 7 popular DNN models indicate that Fake Gradient is effective in protecting the privacy and defending against adversarial attacks targeting image classification applications.",

We propose a metric-based dummy gate insertion process to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using Total Variation Distance (TVD) and validated using IBM’s noisy simulators. Our metric guided dummy gate insertion process achieves TVD of up to 28.83%, and performs 10.14% better than the average TVD and performs within 12.45% of the best obtainable TVD for the test benchmarks.

In response, researchers and educators have looked to integrate ethics into Computer Science curricula, either by creating ethics-exclusive courses or embedding ethics into existing computing topics. Regardless of approach, few ethics integrations seek to explicitly center counternarratives, narratives opposing dominant narratives within computing, as a method of instruction. Given an existing teaching opportunity, our prior experience with computer systems education, and a lack of existing ethics integrations into computer systems, we integrated counternarratives into an introductory systems course. We framed this integration through theHouse of Computing (HoC), a structural metaphor that frames the computing discipline as an object for critique. Throughout the course, we presented counternarratives alongside technical content. We assessed student understanding of counternarratives through \"floorplans'': metaphorical representations of course units, or floors within theHoC. Through an analysis of students' first floorplan, we found that nearly every student expressed existing or newfound awareness of structural problems within computing, though the novelty of the floorplans concept challenged students. Based on this experience, we offer recommendations for instructors looking to teach computer systems critically or integrate counternarratives into other computing courses.",

Most of the researchers have employed traditional security approaches in virtualization. However, these approaches are not effective enough for the modern environment. Instead, Introspection-based approaches such as Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) are more useful to protect the virtualized environment. VMI approaches provide robust solutions in identifying the user and kernel-level processes-based attacks by positioning the security tool outside the VM. The successful implementation of these solutions is still challenging due to having heterogeneous design architectures of hypervisors. In this paper, a comprehensive study of VMI approaches is provided with the perspective of facilitating secure attack detection solutions in the virtualization environment. Various open research challenges are identified and discussed in detail. A brief discussion on the various VMI libraries is provided to give some practical insights to readers.

Due to the precision, vulnerability, and important function of brain tissues, it is essential to ensure the precision and safety of brain tissues surrounding the diseased part. The present study proposes the use of a robot-assisted tele-surgery system to accomplish the process. With the aim to achieve accuracy, an output-bounded and RBF neural network–based bilateral position control method was designed to guarantee the stability and accuracy of the operation process. For the purpose of accomplishing a minimal amount of bleeding and damage, an adaptive force control of the slave manipulator was proposed, allowing it to be appropriate to contact the susceptible vessels, nerves, and brain tissues.

        "abstract": "Embedded systems have become prominent targets for cyberattacks. To exploit firmware’s memory corruption vulnerabilities, cybercriminals harvest reusable code gadgets from the large shared library codebase (e.g., uClibc). Unfortunately, unlike their desktop counterparts, embedded systems lack essential computing resources to enforce security hardening techniques. Recently, we have witnessed a surge of software debloating as a new defense mechanism against code-reuse attacks; it erases unused code to significantly diminish the possibilities of constructing reusable gadgets. Because of the single firmware image update style, static library debloating shows promise to fortify embedded systems without compromising performance and forward compatibility. However, static library debloating on stripped binaries (e.g., firmware’s shared libraries) is still an enormous challenge. In this paper, we show that this challenge is not insurmountable for MIPS firmware. We develop a novel system, named uTrimmer, to identify and wipe out unused basic blocks from shared libraries’ binary code, without causing additional runtime overhead or memory consumption. We propose a new method to identify address-taken blocks/functions, which further help us maintain an inter-procedural control flow graph to conservatively include library code that could be potentially used by firmware. By capturing address access patterns for position-independent code, we circumvent the challenge of determining code-pointer targets and safely eliminate unused code. We run uTrimmer to debloat shared libraries for SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks, popular firmware applications (e.g., Apache, BusyBox, and OpenSSL), and a real-world wireless router firmware image. Our experiments show that not only does uTrimmer deliver functional programs, but also it can cut the exposed code surface and eliminate various reusable code gadgets remarkably. uTrimmer’s debloating capability can compete with the static linking results.",

        "abstract": "Logic locking is a prominent technique to protect the integrity of hardware designs throughout the integrated circuit design and fabrication flow. However, in recent years, the security of locking schemes has been thoroughly challenged by the introduction of various deobfuscation attacks. As in most research branches, deep learning is being introduced in the domain of logic locking as well. Therefore, in this article we present SnapShot, a novel attack on logic locking that is the first of its kind to utilize artificial neural networks to directly predict a key bit value from a locked synthesized gate-level netlist without using a golden reference. Hereby, the attack uses a simpler yet more flexible learning model compared to existing work. Two different approaches are evaluated. The first approach is based on a simple feedforward fully connected neural network. The second approach utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve more complex convolutional neural network architectures specialized for the given task. The attack flow offers a generic and customizable framework for attacking locking schemes using machine learning techniques. We perform an extensive evaluation of SnapShot for two realistic attack scenarios, comprising both reference combinational and sequential benchmark circuits as well as silicon-proven RISC-V core modules. The evaluation results show that SnapShot achieves an average key prediction accuracy of 82.60% for the selected attack scenario, with a significant performance increase of 10.49 percentage points compared to the state of the art. Moreover, SnapShot outperforms the existing technique on all evaluated benchmarks. The results indicate that the security foundation of common logic locking schemes is built on questionable assumptions. Based on the lessons learned, we discuss the vulnerabilities and potentials of logic locking uncovered by SnapShot. The conclusions offer insights into the challenges of designing future logic locking schemes that are resilient to machine learning attacks.",

However, the PUF circuits are suffering from the modeling attacks in recent years. The design of anti-modeling-attack PUF is still an open issue. The XbarPUF with both column swapping and XORing was reported as an anti-modeling-attack PUF in 2017. This work proposes a two-step attack method. The first step transforms the target PUF into the XbarPUFs with XORing only, based on the column swapping states. The second step attacks the XbarPUFs with XORing only by the intentionally designed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. This method can predict the challenge response pairs (CRPs) of the XbarPUF with both column swapping and XORing successfully. To enhance the anti-modeling-attack capability, an improved XbarPUF is further proposed, which uses the dynamic column swapping technique. The results show that the prediction accuracy of attacks for the XbarPUF with both column swapping and XORing and the proposed XbarPUF reaches 98.96% and 70%, respectively, if the training CRPs account for one millionth of the total CRPs. The proposed XbarPUF has a better anti-attack capability than the XbarPUF with both column swapping and XORing.",

The subsystem of employment management can be considered as one of the named areas. The general idea and goal of that subsystem is to form a rational structure of employment as a key element of the recovery and subsequent development of the socio-economic system in the post-pandemic period. During the pandemic all the elements of economic system were involved, not only the national interests of the state in economic, social, internal (home) political, informational, international and in other spheres, but also sphere of individual interests felt a significant negative impact on themselves - many citizens were alienated from production processes, lost their jobs, which led to a significant imbalance employment within the labour market of the country. Thus, new directions for studying and researching the role of the labor market as one of the backbone factors of the socio-economic system, as well as the development of conceptual approaches to assessing and forecasting trends in the labour market in the context of maintaining national interests and ensuring the economic security of the socio-economic system, have become actualized. Analyzing conditions of the labour market, its performance in various situations, economic combinations can help in process of developing a balanced system of measures implemented in accordance with the strategy of economic development and aimed at forming and maintaining the required level of resilience of the region to crisis phenomena. The authors investigated the main modern challenges and threats to the economic security of the socio-economic system, have contributed significantly to the advancement of the-state-of-the-art in economic security of the socio-economic system, which impede not only the realization of national interests, but also the systematic economic recovery in the post-pandemic period.

        "abstract": "With the construction and improvement of 5G infrastructure, more devices choose to access the Internet to achieve some functions. People are paying more attention to information security in the use of network devices. This makes lightweight block ciphers become a hotspot. A lightweight block cipher with superior performance can ensure the security of information while reducing the consumption of device resources. Traditional optimization tools, such as brute force or random search, are often used to solve the design of Symmetric-Key primitives. The metaheuristic algorithm was first used to solve the design of Symmetric-Key primitives of SKINNY. The genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm are used to increase the number of active S-boxes in SKINNY, thus improving the security of SKINNY. Based on this, to improve search efficiency and optimize search results, we design a novel metaheuristic algorithm, named particle swarm-like normal optimization algorithm (PSNO) to design the Symmetric-Key primitives of SKINNY. With our algorithm, one or better algorithm components can be obtained more quickly. The results in the experiments show that our search results are better than those of the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm. The search efficiency is significantly improved. The algorithm we proposed can be generalized to the design of Symmetric-Key primitives of other lightweight block ciphers with clear evaluation indicators, where the corresponding indicators can be used as the objective functions.",

        "abstract": "The traditional long-established networks and networking techniques are no longer suitable for future ever-expanding networking requirements, specifically, the automation and programmability of network communications. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is the most agreeable solution for that. SDN logically uses a centralized controller that applies a standard open Application Programming Interface (API) to directly control the packet handling functions of network devices. OpenFlow is currently the main and widely known communication protocol in SDN architectures. As a result of such centralization, the SDN architecture subjected the controller as a single point with more attacks surfaces for each layer. This entails the search for more security and protection procedures to the SDN architecture without scarifying its swift response to changing business requirements. This paper aims to enhance the protection of the divisions' concept in SDN architecture, which reduces the creation of more attack surfaces that can be targeted by malicious activities. Thus, the research focuses on the design of a dependable SDN controller platform model via Defense In-Depth (DID) techniques, including the requirements for a secure, resilient, and robust controller. The Dynamic Defense In-Depth (DDID) model is proposed to be deployed for the SDN control layer to enhance overall OpenFlow protocol security. Detailed measurable threats and protection mechanisms, according to the DDID model, were investigated and implemented using a simulation environment (mininet). Also, the paper proposes an evaluation mechanism (and tests) to confirm the applicability of secure structure requirements to the SDN controller layer. The obtained results confirm the promising potential of achieving the required security goals.",

Despite the suitability of arbiter physically unclonable function (APUF) among other PUF variants for the IoT applications, implementing it on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is challenging. This work presents the complete characterization of the path changing switch (PCS)1 based APUF on two different families of FPGA, like Spartan-3E (90 nm CMOS) and Artix-7 (28 nm CMOS). A comprehensive study of the existing tuning concept for programmable delay logic (PDL) based APUF implemented on FPGA is presented, leading to establishment of its practical infeasibility. We investigate the entropy, randomness properties of the PCS based APUF suitable for practical applications, and the effect of temperature variation signifying the adequate tolerance against environmental variation. The XOR composition of PCS based APUF is introduced to boost performance and security. The robustness of the PCS based APUF against machine learning based modeling attack is evaluated, showing similar characteristics as the conventional APUF. Experimental results validate the efficacy of PCS based APUF with a little hardware footprint removing the paucity of lightweight security primitive for IoT.",

Such environments allow learners to interact with both virtual and real worlds and bringing in potential enhancements to the learning process at the same time. For example, chatbots can facilitate the learning process. However, security and privacy settings for interacting with chatbots in such mixed reality environments are complex. In this paper, we introduce a mixed reality virtual assistant that is integrated into the collaborative environment of our existing application VIAProMa. This embodied chatbot allows lecturers and students to participate in mixed reality and online classrooms in real-time. The participants can interact with each other via VIAProMa’s avatar representations and can communicate with the chatbot that is represented by the mixed reality bot. The bot is realized by connecting a Slack chatbot with the mixed reality learning environment. It is displayed as an intuitive 3D model and is able to communicate with the users in spoken language. In this environment, privacy and security settings are conducted to protect the user input and user interaction with the bot. The evaluation results show that the system works stably with good performance. All the visualizations and features are well designed and were understood by the users. Users preferred the speech interface with the bot over a textual interface. The research has a strong impact on the design of security and privacy features for mixed reality environments in general.",

The primary assumption is that a generalised accounting framework should be developed in a permissioned platform. Accounting data are periodically and mandatorily disclosed in financial statements that summarise the companies’ financial performances. However, accounting books are not expected to be made available to the public, including detailed and sensitive data. Indeed, disclosing all the accounting transactions might compromise the confidentiality of the company know-how, including a list of suppliers, mark-up, a list of customers and so forth. The introduction of a shared ledger might be considered a threat that could jeopardise business big data confidentiality, data security and privacy.

Classification and detection of acoustic events has numerous real-world applications such as anomaly detection in industrial instruments and machinery, smart home systems, security applications, tagging audio data and in creating systems to aid the hearing-impaired individuals. While environmental sounds can encompass a large variety of sounds, we will focus specifically on certain urban sounds in our study and make use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have traditionally been used to classify image data, for our analysis on audio data.

        "abstract": "AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is an emerging technology of AMD server processors, which provides transparent memory encryption and key management for virtual machines (VM) without trusting the underlying hypervisor. Like Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX), SEV forms a foundation for confidential computing on untrusted machines; unlike SGX, SEV supports full VM encryption and thus makes porting applications straightforward. To date, many mainstream cloud service providers, including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, have already adopted (or are planning to adopt) SEV for confidential cloud services.  In this paper, we provide the first exploration of the security issues of TLB management on SEV processors and demonstrate a novel class of TLB Poisoning attacks against SEV VMs. We first demystify how SEV extends the TLB implementation atop AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) and show that the TLB management is no longer secure under SEV’s threat model, which allows the hypervisor to poison TLB entries between two processes of a SEV VM. We then present TLB Poisoning Attacks, a class of attacks that break the integrity and confidentiality of the SEV VM by poisoning its TLB entries. Two variants of TLB Poisoning Attacks are described in the paper; and two end-to-end attacks are performed successfully on both AMD SEV and SEV-ES.",

        "abstract": "Private learning of top-k, i.e., the k most frequent values also called heavy hitters, is a common industry scenario: Companies want to privately learn, e.g., frequently typed new words to improve suggestions on mobile devices, often used browser settings, telemetry data of frequent crashes, heavily shared articles, etc. Real-world deployments often use local differential privacy, where distributed users share locally randomized data with an untrusted server. Central differential privacy, on the other hand, assumes access to the raw data and applies the randomization only once, on the aggregated result. These solutions either require large amounts of users for high accuracy (local model) or a trusted third party (central model).We present multi-party computation protocols HH and PEM of sketches (succinct data structures) to efficiently compute differentially private top-k: HH has running time linear in the size of the data and is applicable for very small data sets (hundreds of values), and PEM is sublinear in the data domain and provides better accuracy than HH for large data sizes. Our approaches are efficient (practical running time, requiring no output reconstruction as other sketches) and more accurate than local differential privacy even for a small number of users. In our experiments we were able to securely compute differentially private top-k in less than 10 minutes using 3 semi-honest computation parties distributed over the Internet with inputs from hundreds of users (HH) and input size that is independent of the user count (PEM, excluding count aggregation).",

        "abstract": "End-to-end email encryption (E2EE) ensures that an email could only be decrypted and read by its intended recipients. E2EE’s strong security guarantee is particularly desirable for the enterprises in the event of breaches: even if attackers break into an email server, under E2EE no contents of emails are leaked. Meanwhile, E2EE brings significant challenges for an enterprise to detect and filter unwanted emails (spams and phishing emails). Most existing solutions rely heavily on email contents (i.e., email body and attachments), which would be difficult when email contents are encrypted. In this paper, we investigate how to detect unwanted emails in a content-agnostic manner, that is, without access to the contents of emails at all.  Our key observation is that the communication patterns and relationships among internal users of an enterprise contain rich and reliable information about benign email communications. Combining such information with other metadata of emails (headers and subjects when available), unwanted emails can be accurately distinguished from legitimate ones without access to email contents. Specifically, we propose two types of novel enterprise features from enterprise email logs: sender profiling features, which capture the patterns of past emails from external senders to internal recipients; and enterprise graph features, which capture the co-recipient and the sender-recipient relationships between internal users. We design a classifier utilizing the above features along with existing meta-data features. We run extensive experiments over a real-world enterprise email dataset, and show that our approach, even without any content-based features, achieves high true positive rate of 95.2% and low false positive rate of 0.3% with such stringent constraints.",

        "abstract": "Today, an increasing number of applications rely on location and proximity information to deliver services. With the introduction of Wi-Fi Fine Timing Measurement (FTM) in the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, Wi-Fi derived location and proximity information will play a key role in many safety- and security-critical applications. For example, Wi-Fi FTM is adopted in Wi-Fi Aware where it enables geo-fencing and mobile identification. In this paper, we perform the first security analysis of Wi-Fi FTM and analyze its security guarantees across the logical and physical layers. We find various weaknesses that enable an attacker to introduce distance reductions and enlargements to any arbitrary attacker-chosen value, requiring commodity hardware only. We perform an evaluation using commercial access points, smartphones, and off-the-shelf Wi-Fi cards, and show that an attacker can manipulate distances with meter-level precision. Furthermore, we highlight the distance manipulation attacks which are independent of any higher-layer cryptographic protection, exposing fundamental limitations to achieving secure distance measurements in the current standard. Finally, we present security recommendations for the design and implementation of Wi-Fi FTM and next-generation positioning protocols.",

        "abstract": "Use of game theory and mechanism design in cloud security is a well-studied topic. When applicable, it has the advantages of being efficient and simple compared to cryptography alone. Most analyses consider two-party settings, or multi-party settings where coalitions are not allowed. However, many cloud security problems that we face are in the multi-party setting and the involved parties can almost freely collaborate with each other. To formalize the study of disincentivizing coalitions from deviating strategies, a well-known definition named k-resiliency has been proposed by Abraham et al. (ACM PODC '06). Since its proposal, k-resiliency and related definitions are used extensively for mechanism design. However, in this work we observe the shortcoming of k-resiliency. That is, although this definition is secure, it is too strict to use for many cases and rule out secure mechanisms as insecure. To overcome this issue, we propose a new definition named ℓ-repellence against the presence of a single coalition to replace k-resiliency. Our definition incorporates transferable utility in game theory as it is realistic in many distributed and multi-party computing settings. We also propose m-stability definition against the presence of multiple coalitions, which is inspired by threshold security in cryptography. We then show the advantages of our novel definitions on three mechanisms, none of which were previously analyzed against coalitions: incentivized cloud computation, forwarding data packages in ad hoc networks, and connectivity in ad hoc networks. Regarding the former, our concepts improve the proposal by Küpçü (IEEE TDSC '17), by ensuring a coalition-proof mechanism.",

Because of the dynamic features of JavaScript, it is difficult to obtain detailed information about the module dependencies, which is vital for reasoning about the potential consequences of security vulnerabilities in libraries, and for many other software development tasks. The underlying challenge is how to construct precise call graphs that capture the connectivity between functions in the modules.  In this work we present a novel approach to call graph construction for Node.js applications that is modular, taking into account the modular structure of Node.js applications, and sufficiently accurate and efficient to be practically useful. We demonstrate experimentally that the constructed call graphs are useful for security scanning, reducing the number of false positives by 81% compared to npm audit and with zero false negatives. Compared to js-callgraph, the call graph construction is significantly more accurate and efficient. The experiments also show that the analysis time is reduced substantially when reusing modular call graphs.",

        "abstract": "The single-board computer (SBC) is a compact, powerful and cost-effective system on chip (SOC) that can perform all complex tasks that may be executed by the desktop computer. Further, with the development of the SBCs having a powerful processor and high RAM support–they are already deployed in many applications such as in agriculture, home security, automation, drones, unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and like-wise. However, each SBC has a unique capability and therefore some SBC may perform better than others depending upon the application. Further, some SBC has high processing power but they are either costly or support fewer I/O pins. Similarly, some SBC are cost-effective, has a high number of I/O pins but they have quite less processing power for executing complex instructions and tasks. In addition, for some SBC there is no dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) available that can be used to program SBC according to the user-specific need. Due to these above-mentioned problems, the user has to either invest in the high processing power SBC (having high price) but compromise with less I/O pins or invest in the SBC (having low price) that has the high number of I/O pins but compromise with low processing power (although there are some SBCs available in the market that has high processing power along with the high number of I/O pins. But they are available at a quite high price so we are not considering these SBCs). In both cases, the user is not able to integrate intelligent high processing sensors and equip the system in which SBC is used with new features over time. To over this problem, we are introducing a smart and highly intelligent hybrid implementation of Raspberry pi model 3b+ with Arduino UNO board for controlling UGV. During testing, we have found that our developed hybrid SBC system for UGV work quite impressively. The CPU utilization and CPU temperature readings of the hybrid system are noted while performing various complex tasks on the UGV. Further during the evaluation process, it is observed that UGV consumed a maximum of 80% of system CPU utilization to perform all the allocated tasks efficiently. The rest 20% of the CPU usage as well as some of the GPIO pins of Raspberry pi are reserved and can be used to implement various complex applications in the UGV based on the user requirement.",

Our Fall 2021 upper-division entering student cohort is 70% female and 80% people of color. Our new computer science program builds on our strong and internationally recognized track record in applying project-based learning (PBL) in engineering. We believe our PBL CS program to be the first program of its type in North America. Key components of the program are: project-based learning across multiple courses in the upper-division, project-based learning within lower-division courses, straightforward articulation with regional and national community colleges that are minority serving institutions (MSIs), industry and research connections that drive projects, and vertical integration of teams across upper-division semesters. Core to this is a commitment to addressing access and equity issues. The foundation for the new upper-division program is a revamped lower-division core curriculum that also feeds into the information technology and information systems majors offered at our school. The core curriculum is designed to reduce barriers to a degree in computing while encouraging more students to explore a degree in the math-intensive computer science program.

To address these issues, we propose a dual-mode privacy-preserving framework for the security layer of the proposed network architecture. Specifically, we construct a privacy protection identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption scheme to provide privacy to a set of vehicles with data requests. Furthermore, we use a federated learning scheme based on local differential privacy in the proposed NDN-based architecture for MEC-empowered IoV to achieve high-speed response and decision making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme performs effectively.",

        "abstract": "There is a national shortage of certified computer science (CS) teachers. While significant effort and resources have been put towards addressing this shortage, the number of newly certified CS teachers entering the profession each year remains low. In this position paper, we argue that Colleges of Information Studies (iSchools) can serve as fertile grounds for recruiting future K-12 CS teachers. The motivation for looking to iSchools as venues for expanding the K-12 CS teacher pipeline is threefold: (1) the content taught in undergraduate iSchool programs closely aligns with K-12 CS content, (2) undergraduate programs in iSchools are experiencing rapid growth in enrollment and have a diverse student body, and (3) iSchools focus on social aspects of computing and thus attract students well-suited for K-12 teaching as a profession. To develop these arguments, we review the content of top iSchool undergraduate programs, showing the alignment between iSchool undergraduate coursework and K-12 CS. Further, using the University of Maryland's Bachelor of Science in Information Sciences as a case study, we show how iSchools can serve as contexts for preparing future K-12 CS teachers. Collectively, this work seeks to expand how we think about recruiting future CS teachers, explicating arguing for iSchools as venues for expanding the K-12 CS teacher pipeline.",

        "source": "ICER 2021: Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research",
        "abstract": "Concerns about participation in computer science at all levels of education continue to rise, despite the substantial efforts of research, policy, and world-wide education initiatives. In this paper, which is guided by a systematic literature review, we investigate the issue of inequalities in participation by bringing a theoretical lens from the sociology of education, and particularly, Bourdieu’s theory of social reproduction. By paying particular attention to Bourdieu’s theorising of capital, habitus, and field, we first establish an alignment between Bourdieu’s theory and what is known about inequalities in computer science (CS) participation; we demonstrate how the factors affecting participation constitute capital forms that individuals possess to leverage within the computer science field, while students’ views and dispositions towards computer science and scientists are rooted in their habitus which influences their successful assimilation in computer science fields. Subsequently, by projecting the issue of inequalities in CS participation to Bourdieu’s sociological theorisations, we explain that because most interventions do not consider the issue holistically and not in formal education settings, the reported benefits do not continue in the long-term which reproduces the problem. Most interventions have indeed contributed significantly to the issue, but they have either focused on developing some aspects of computer science capital or on designing activities that, although inclusive in terms of their content and context, attempt to re-construct students’ habitus to “fit” in the already “pathologized” computer science fields. Therefore, we argue that to contribute significantly to the equity and participation issue in computer science, research and interventions should focus on restructuring the computer science field and the rules of participation, as well as on building holistically students’ computer science capital and habitus within computer science fields.",

The sensors are connected with an Edge device and LoRa node for processing and transferring the MTS, respectively. The system first proposes a deep learning-based compression-decompression model for reducing the size of MTS at the Edge devices. Next, it uses game theory for finding a minimum-cost security mechanism to facilitate the secure transmission of MTS. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain a suitable compression ratio and security mechanism to reduce the system's energy consumption, delay, and security cost. Finally, the system presents an algorithm for selecting the suitable spreading factors to transfer the compressed and secured MTS to the application server in the given time period with desired accuracy.

These formulas need to capture properties of the system evolution in time, and of its distribution in space, thus requiring a mix of spatial and temporal logic modalities. Furthermore, in scenarios where access to the cloud might not be available, monitoring their validity should be performed autonomously by the distributed system itself. Previous works show that through the aggregate computing approach, and targeting the field calculus language, automatic translations of spatial or temporal logic formulas into distributed decentralized monitors are possible. However, the definition and translation of properties mixing space and time has not been considered so far. In this paper, we start the investigation on integrating space and time modalities through examples, outlining a roadmap for a fully-fledged distributed monitoring of space-time properties.",

It is therefore crucial for the authorities to reduce risks when accessing their online services. This includes catering to secure identification of service, secure resolution of name to network service, and content security and privacy as a minimum base for trustworthy communication.  In this paper, we take a first look at Alerting Authorities (AA) in the US and investigate security measures related to trustworthy and secure communication. We study the domain namespace structure, DNSSEC penetration, and web certificates. We introduce an integrative threat model to better understand whether and how the online presence and services of AAs are harmed. As an illustrative example, we investigate 1,388 Alerting Authorities. We observe partial heightened security relative to the global Internet trends, yet find cause for concern as about 78% of service providers fail to deploy measures of trustworthy service provision. Our analysis shows two major shortcomings. First, how the DNS ecosystem is leveraged: about 50% of organizations do not own their dedicated domain names and are dependent on others, 55% opt for unrestricted-use namespaces, which simplifies phishing, and less than 4% of unique AA domain names are secured by DNSSEC, which can lead to DNS poisoning and possibly to certificate misissuance. Second, how Web PKI certificates are utilized: 15% of all hosts provide none or invalid certificates, thus cannot cater to confidentiality and data integrity, 64% of the hosts provide domain validation certification that lack any identity information, and shared certificates have gained on popularity, which leads to fate-sharing and can be a cause for instability.",

        "abstract": "To ensure secure and trustworthy execution of applications in potentially insecure environments, vendors frequently embed trusted execution environments (TEE) into their systems. Applications executed in this safe, isolated space are protected from adversaries, including a malicious operating system. TEEs are usually build by integrating protection mechanisms directly into the processor or by using dedicated external secure elements. However, both of these approaches only cover a narrow threat model resulting in limited security guarantees. Enclaves nested into the application processor typically provide weak isolation between the secure and non-secure domain, especially when considering side-channel attacks. Although external secure elements do provide strong isolation, the slow communication interface to the application processor is exposed to adversaries and restricts the use cases. Independently of the used approach, TEEs often lack the possibility to establish secure communication to peripherals, and most operating systems executed inside TEEs do not provide state-of-the-art defense strategies, making them vulnerable to various attacks. We argue that TEEs, such as Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone, implemented on the main application processor, are insecure, especially when considering side-channel attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate how a heterogeneous multicore architecture can be utilized to realize a secure TEE design. We directly embed a secure processor into our HECTOR-V architecture to provide strong isolation between the secure and non-secure domain. The tight coupling of the TEE and the application processor enables HECTOR-V to provide mechanisms for establishing secure communication channels between different devices. We further introduce RISC-V Secure Co-Processor (RVSCP), a security-hardened processor tailored for TEEs. To secure applications executed inside the TEE, RVSCP provides hardware enforced control-flow integrity and rigorously restricts I/O accesses to certain execution states. RVSCP reduces the trusted computing base to a minimum by providing operating system services directly in hardware.",

        "abstract": "The modern x86 processor (e.g., Intel, AMD) translates CISC-style x86 instructions to RISC-style micro operations (uops) as RISC pipelines are more efficient than CISC pipelines. However, this x86 decoding process requires complex hardware logic (i.e., x86 decoder) to identify variable-length x86 instructions, which incurs high translation overhead. To avoid this overhead, the x86 processors adopt a micro-operation cache (uop cache) to bypass the expensive x86 decoder by caching the decoded uops.  In this paper, we find out modern uop caches suffer from (1) security vulnerability and (2) severe cache contention between co-located SMT cores. To understand these security and performance implications of the uop cache, we propose UC-Check to extract various undisclosed features by using carefully designed microbenchmarks. With the extracted features, (1) we present two attack scenarios exploiting the uop cache as a new timing side-channel and propose a secure architecture to mitigate these attacks with negligible overhead. In addition, (2) we propose a logical uop cache allocation technique to alleviate the cache contention problem.  For the evaluation, we extract many undocumented features on a wide spectrum of modern x86 processors and show that our proposed schemes (e.g., security attack/defense, performance optimization) are directly applicable to commodity x86 processors. For example, our logical uop cache allocation improves uop cache hit ratios by up to 1.33 × and achieves up to 1.04 × throughput improvement. We release all software artifacts (e.g., microbenchmarks used for feature extraction, attack proof-of-concept codes, logical uop cache allocation) to the community so that the users can easily reproduce our results and gain insights for further research.",

Hence, this paper puts forward a real-time situation assessment method based on the threat propagation model. This method establishes a threat propagation model of real-time situation assessment, in order to calculate the threat degree of threat propagation source to target network, and to evaluate the real-time situation assessment from two layers which includes the network node layer and the whole network layer. The results of simulation experiment show that the method proposed in this paper can evaluate the potential threats according to the current attack scenarios, and can achieve a real-time assessment on the attacks in the network since the situation of real-time network attacks change obviously. In short, the effectiveness, accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed method are verified by comparative experiments.",

Despite these concerns, automated image description has become an important tool to ensure equitable access to information for blind and low vision people. In this paper, we investigate the ethical dilemmas faced by companies that have adopted the use of computer vision for producing alt text: textual descriptions of images for blind and low vision people. We use Facebook's automatic alt text tool as our primary case study. First, we analyze the policies that Facebook has adopted with respect to identity categories, such as race, gender, age, etc., and the company's decisions about whether to present these terms in alt text. We then describe an alternative---and manual---approach practiced in the museum community, focusing on how museums determine what to include in alt text descriptions of cultural artifacts. We compare these policies, using notable points of contrast to develop an analytic framework that characterizes the particular apprehensions behind these policy choices. We conclude by considering two strategies that seem to sidestep some of these concerns, finding that there are no easy ways to avoid the normative dilemmas posed by the use of computer vision to automate alt text.",

We present a software solution of Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) that utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision (CV) and other algorithmic techniques to locate, detect, and manage inventory storage logistics using label information from simple warehouse images. When used in conjunction with a recently developed robotic imaging system, our pipeline can be shown to replace the need for costly, error-prone human input to the inventory tracking system. This paper outlines the technical and practical application of IPA fueled by deep learning. The specific motivation for this project was to address a critical need of Mercedes-Benz U.S. International (MBUSI), but the techniques could be applied more generally to other inventory management contexts. We also discuss how our pipeline produces an inexpensive, efficient, and generalizable solution that provides the capability to retrieve data from an unpredictable environment, in contrast to previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "In the past few years, an increasing number of machine-learning and deep learning structures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been applied to solving a wide range of real-life problems. However, these architectures are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: inputs crafted carefully to force the system output to a wrong label. Since machine-learning is being deployed in safety-critical and security-sensitive domains, such attacks may have catastrophic security and safety consequences. In this paper, we propose for the first time to use hardware-supported approximate computing to improve the robustness of machine learning classifiers. We show that our approximate computing implementation achieves robustness across a wide range of attack scenarios. Specifically, we show that successful adversarial attacks against the exact classifier have poor transferability to the approximate implementation. The transferability is even poorer for the black-box attack scenarios, where adversarial attacks are generated using a proxy model. Surprisingly, the robustness advantages also apply to white-box attacks where the attacker has unrestricted access to the approximate classifier implementation: in this case, we show that substantially higher levels of adversarial noise are needed to produce adversarial examples. Furthermore, our approximate computing model maintains the same level in terms of classification accuracy, does not require retraining, and reduces resource utilization and energy consumption of the CNN. We conducted extensive experiments on a set of strong adversarial attacks; We empirically show that the proposed implementation increases the robustness of a LeNet-5 and an Alexnet CNNs by up to 99% and 87%, respectively for strong transferability-based attacks along with up to 50% saving in energy consumption due to the simpler nature of the approximate logic. We also show that a white-box attack requires a remarkably higher noise budget to fool the approximate classifier, causing an average of 4 dB degradation of the PSNR of the input image relative to the images that succeed in fooling the exact classifier.",

        "abstract": "Motivation Only 27% of computer and mathematical scientists in the United States and 18% of IT specialists in Europe are women. The under-representation of women in the field of Computer Science is, among other things, influenced by stereotypes of computer scientists. These stereotypes include being male, asocial and having an (obsessive) interest in computers. Even though stereotypical beliefs can develop at an early age, research on children’s stereotypes of computer scientists is sparse and inconclusive.  Objectives Stereotypes we hold can be implicit or unconscious beliefs, or explicit or conscious beliefs. In this study, we focus on children’s implicit and explicit stereotypes regarding computer scientists’ gender, social skills and interests. We also study whether explaining what a computer scientist does affects these stereotypes.  Method We study the implicit stereotypes through the reduced-length Child Implicit Association Test and the explicit stereotypes through self-reported absolute and relative Likert scale questions. We gathered data on 564 children between the age of 7 and 18 who were visiting a science museum. The participants in the experiment group (n=352) watch a video of either a man or woman explaining what a computer scientist does at the start of the study.  Results We found weak implicit stereotypical beliefs on computer scientists’ social skills and moderate implicit stereotypical beliefs on computer scientists’ interests. We also found explicit stereotypes on computer scientists’ gender, social skills and interests. Measuring the effects of the intervention, we found significant differences between the control and experiment group in their explicit stereotypes on computer scientists’ social skills.  Discussion The amount of scientific work on children’s stereotypes regarding computer scientists is still limited. Applying the reduced-length Child Implicit Association Test to measure children’s stereotypes on computer scientists has, to our knowledge, not been done before. Understanding children’s stereotypes and how to tackle them contributes to closing the gender gap in Computer Science.",

        "abstract": "The identity or self-concept of computer scientists has received increasing attention in the computing education research (CER) literature in recent years. Identity is often considered relevant both for initially choosing a path of study and subsequent retention. It is therefore also considered highly relevant for the questions of how to reduce drop-out rates and broadening participation of currently underrepresented groups in computing in higher education. However, as more and more students have eligible or mandatory computing education in their K-12 years, identity may become relevant in this area as well.  In this article, we analyze the use and development of identity in the CER literature with a focus on K-12 education. To do so, we undertook a systematic literature review that identified appropriate publications through both a traditional database search (ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, DBLP, and Google Scholar) as well as an additional forward and backward snowballing process. In total, 31 papers from the years 1997-2020 were identified that address identity in the K-12 CS context.  We summarize key research findings from these articles and develop a category system that demonstrate how and why identity is used in CER in the K-12 context. Our findings suggest that the use of identity in K-12 research needs to be thought of in fundamentally different ways than for higher education. Alongside, we provide evidence that the underlying theory is less fragmented than often claimed and highlight potentials arising from greater networking and discussion of identity research in (K-12) CER.",

This is indeed the case in SSCPs, where the passenger arrival times are difficult to predict and requirements for equipment and human resources must be scheduled in advance. The team explicitly included the uncertainties associated with future passenger arrivals and availability and performance levels of the resources in computing staffing and system configuration decisions.

Firstly, the simulation dataset to be used will be pre-processed to reduce the over-fitting of the training model due to the mismatch of feature types and the large difference of feature values. Then, a penalty item will be added every time the parameter is updated, aiming to punish the behaviour greater than 1 when the gradient is updated, which can solve the problem of gradient disappearance to some extent. After the improvement of the traditional GAN algorithm, the prediction accuracy and prediction accuracy of the situation value can be greatly improved, which proves the stability of the improved GAN network.

Decades of exploitation and remediation demonstrated that code inspection and testing alone does not eliminate XSS vulnerabilities in complex web applications with a high degree of confidence. This paper introduces Google's secure-by-design engineering paradigm that effectively prevents DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in large-scale web development. Our approach, named API hardening, enforces a series of company-wide secure coding practices. We provide a set of secure APIs to replace native DOM APIs that are prone to XSS vulnerabilities. Through a combination of type contracts and appropriate validation and escaping, the secure APIs ensure that applications based thereon are free of XSS vulnerabilities. We deploy a simple yet capable compile-time checker to guarantee that developers exclusively use our hardened APIs to interact with the DOM. We make various of efforts to scale this approach to tens of thousands of engineers without significant productivity impact. By offering rigorous tooling and consultant support, we help developers adopt the secure coding practices as seamlessly as possible. We present empirical results showing how API hardening has helped reduce the occurrences of XSS vulnerabilities in Google's enormous code base over the course of two-year deployment.",

In each of these two cases, we conducted a design case study, and we found that collaboration is ad hoc, temporary, and shifting with regards to collaborators, aims, and processes. We argue for the relevance of knotworking and its analytic potential for investigating the kind of collaborative work we observed. We also argue that our two cases present a higher complexity level than how knotworking has previously been described in the literature. We describe complex knotworking as having three characteristics: 1) collaboration happens between a dynamic number of actors (who are usually loosely connected), 2) collaboration happens in episodes, and 3) cooperative work arrangements are constantly negotiated. Using the concept of complex knotworking for a comparative analysis of our two design solutions, we outline generic design guidelines for developing computer support to manage complex knotworking situations.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, all walks of life in society are constantly strengthening network construction and setting up their own local area network. The local area network contains a large number of confidential resources, and there is a risk of leakage when connected to the external network. Therefore, to ensure the security of confidential resources in the local area network, a secure data exchange must be established between the local area network and the external network. Based on this, the purpose of this article is to design a computer information system based on non-contact data transmission. This article firstly studies and analyzes the status quo of network security isolation technology, and then extends the design of non-contact computer systems. This article systematically expounds the function design of non-contact data transmission information, and divides it into two modules of public platform and business platform according to its system structure. This article uses comparative analysis method, observation method and other research methods to carry out experimental research on the subject of this article. The research shows that compared with the current computer information system, the security performance of the information system based on non-contact data transmission in this paper is higher.",

This processing is applied to nine camera streams at three locations from around Vanderbilt University. We collect 70 hours of baseline distancing data over the course of two weeks, after which time we deploy small behavioral interventions at the three locations aimed at increasing distancing compliance. Another 70 hours of data with the interventions in place will be analyzed against the baseline data to determine if they had an effect on distancing compliance.",

Correlated channels are chosen by Pearson's correlation coefficient, and spatial filters are obtained by common spatial pattern (CSP) from these channels. The features of EEG signals are extracted and classified by the spatial filters and support vector machine (SVM), respectively. The average classification accuracy of ten subjects is 73.9%, and it is 2.1% higher than the accuracy without channel selection.

As manufacturing technology advances, the characteristic dimensions of biochip systems keep shrinking, and tens of thousands of microvalves can now be integrated into a coin-sized microfluidic platform, making the conventional manual-based chip design no longer applicable. Accordingly, computer-aided design (CAD) of microfluidics has attracted considerable research interest in the EDA community over the past decade. This review article presents recent advances in the design automation of biochips, involving CAD techniques for architectural synthesis, wash optimization, testing, fault diagnosis, and fault-tolerant design. With the help of these CAD tools, chip designers can be released from the burden of complex, large-scale design tasks. Meanwhile, new chip architectures can be explored automatically to open new doors to meet requirements from future large-scale biological experiments and medical diagnosis. We discuss key trends and directions for future research that are related to enable microfluidics to reach its full potential, thus further advancing the development and progression of the microfluidics industry.",

However, most US R1 universities do not require students to take these courses to complete an undergraduate CS degree. As a result, students can graduate without learning about computer security and secure programming practices. To gauge students' knowledge and skills of secure programming, we conducted a coding interview with 21 students from two R1 universities in the United States. All the students in our study had at least taken Computer Systems or an equivalent course. We then analyzed the students' approach to safe programming practices, such as avoiding unsafe functions like gets and strcpy, and basic security knowledge, such as writing code that assumes user inputs can be malicious. Our results suggest that students lack the key fundamental skills to write secure programs. For example, students rarely pay attention to details, such as compiler warnings, and often do not read programming language documentation with care. Moreover, some students' understanding of memory layout is cursory, which is crucial for writing secure programs. We also found that some students are struggling with even the basics of C programming, even though it is the main language taught in Computer Systems courses.",

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to all communication forms that can complement or replace speech. The practice of AAC mediated by computational applications represents a very attractive alternative. For people with motor and speech difficulties, gestural interaction can be a way to make interaction with AAC systems feasible. In this thesis, a methodology called MyPGI (Methodology to yield Personalized Gestural Interaction) was developed and validated to guide the design of AAC systems for people with motor and speech difficulties in order to promote greater autonomy for them in handling computer systems and for monitoring by their caregivers. The methodology uses Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques to enable non-invasive and personalized gestural interaction using low-cost devices. MyPGI was applied and evaluated in real case studies with people with disabilities, informing the design of an interactive system named PGCA (Personal Gesture Communication Assistant) to allow the creation and use of personalized gestural languages for people with severe motor and speech difficulties.

With the development of deep learning, more and more researchers pay attention to the automatic speech recognition technology based on convolutional neural network. By establishing an end-to-end speech recognition model based on deep neural network, taking logarithmic amplitude spectrum features as the network input, using connectionist temporal classifiers to carry out time sequence classification, and using convolutional neural network to deal with the correlation between frames, an end-to-end speech recognition system is implemented. On this basis, taking the speech interaction scene of intelligent home appliances in the living room as an example, the speech control instruction database of smart home appliances is constructed, and the application research of speech instruction recognition and data instruction generation is carried out. The method of transfer learning is adopted. We train a pre-training model with open source data set firstly, and then re-train the model with self-recorded speech control instruction database. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 12.31% WER on public AISHELL-1 dataset and 2.1% WER on our self-recorded speech control instruction database. The speech instruction recognition system realized in this paper can quickly recognize speech instructions and convert them into formatted data instructions that can drive intelligent home appliances, thus improving the communication efficiency between human and machine.",

        "abstract": "A common belief among students is that computing is a boring subject that lacks a connection to the real world. The first class (one 80-minute session) in an introductory computer science course may be an appropriate instance to combat such a belief. Previous studies have used coursewide interventions, e.g., games and physical/tangible devices to improve students’ motivation. However, although other approaches help motivate students, they may lack real-world context or have a high cost of deployment. This article proposes a novel real-world based approach to introduce programming concepts in the first class of the introductory computer science course. This approach, called Protobject based, is applicable to courses with over 100 students, has a low deployment entry barrier, requires low investment, and may be used creatively to implement different experiences. Furthermore, the Protobject-based approach has an equivalent motivational effect—at least in the short-term—to a Game-based approach even if it is entirely focused on the real world. The low requirements of the approach make it especially suitable for an 80-minute first class in an introductory computer science course. The Protobject-based approach has been preliminarily validated and compared to a pure game-based approach with a study with 376 participants, and we present the analysis of motivation questionnaires, a pre-test and post-test, and a homework assignment given to the students. We posit that more research into initiatives such as this one—that can show students how computer science can impact the real world around them—is warranted.",

        "abstract": "The recent decade has seen a tremendous increase in volumes of data consumed and generated. Towards storing such data, companies typically make use of centralised cloud storage systems which allow for on-demand scalability and a pay-per-use model. These storage providers, while presenting many benefits, have several downsides in terms of (i) posing as a single point of failure (e.g. data breaches), (ii) featuring the potential for misuse of confidential or personal data, as well as (iii) being not nearly as competitive as they could be which has resulted in inflated prices. In recent years, along with blockchain-based technologies, novel distributed storage platforms such as Storj and Sia, have emerged that tackle these issues by enabling a dynamic storage market between hosts and renters. In comparison to traditional Peer-to-Peer (P2P) storage solutions (e.g. BitTorrrent), these platforms rely on incentivization-based P2P hosting which ensures file availability, robustness and price competitiveness, while also preserving confidentiality and ownership through end-to-end encryption. In this paper, we present a brief overview of such storage platforms, as well as provide two major contributions in the form of (i) an architectural overview, as well as (ii) a high-level security exploration on the dev./test environment of Storj. The latter has resulted in the discovery of a DoS vulnerability, which we experimentally evaluated to be highly feasible. We have contacted Storj and they assessed that their production system1 is not vulnerable to such an attack.",

        "abstract": "Chinese domestic securitization market expands dramatically in past few year. The whole securitization market is divided in to three parts, which are Credit ABS, Enterprise ABS and ABN. In this paper, only Enterprise ABS is considered as the subject due to its domination in ABS market. And a GLM model is built in order to examine the price determinants are of Enterprise ABS. The result obtained from the first regression is consistent with relatively mature ABS market, such as US and Europe, which are studied in literature. However, the analysis of variance shows that the model is not accurate enough. Therefore, Full Subset Regression is used in order to remove some variables based on the selection result. After that, the detailed economic explanations of removing some variables are discussed. It is concluded that all the reasons given are highly related to the characteristics of Enterprise ABS. This paper suggests that investor can not only focus on credit rating, they also need to consider many aspects like domestic macroeconomy, guarantor and originator's financial status when making Enterprise ABS investment decision.",

The use of new media and new technology to strengthen aerobics teaching and education can activate the classroom atmosphere on the premise of improving the quality of teaching, and it is self-evident to the importance of aerobics teaching. The purpose of this article is to study the application and design of CAI system in aerobics teaching. This article firstly analyzes the functional and non-functional requirements of the CAI system in the teaching of aerobics from the method of teaching needs. Then the system design of the administrator subsystem, the teacher subsystem and the student subsystem in the functional design of the system modules are carried out, and the feasibility and reliability of the system are determined through the function and performance test of the system. Finally, through observation method and questionnaire survey method, the two classes of CAI and traditional teaching are analyzed systematically. Survey data shows that about 90% of students in CAI classes are focused, while only 70% of students in traditional teaching classes are focused; traditional teaching classes account for 21% of participants, while CAI participation is about 42%. It shows that CAI is generally better than traditional teaching in terms of students' classroom performance.",

        "abstract": "How can we detect and analyze hyperlink-driven misbehavior in online forums? Online forums contain enormous amounts of user-generated content, with threads and comments frequently supplemented by hyperlinks. These hyperlinks are often posted with malicious intention and we refer to this as 'hyperlink-driven misbehavior'. We present LinkMan, a systematic suite of capabilities, to detect and analyze hyperlink-driven misbehavior in online forums. We take a unique perspective focusing on hyperlink sharing practices of the users to spot misbehavior. LinkMan can categorize these hyperlinks as: a) phishing, b) spamming, and b) promoting malicious products. Our approach consists of three high-level phases: (a) extracting hyperlinks from the textual data, (b) identifying misbehaving hyperlinks, and (c) modeling the behavioral patterns of hyperlink sharing, where we identify key hyperlinks and analyze the collaboration dynamics of hyperlink sharing. In addition, we implement our approach as a powerful and easy-to-use open platform for practitioners. We apply LinkMan to spot misbehavior from three online security forums, where we expect the users to be more security-aware. We show that our approach works very well in terms of retrieving and classifying hyperlinks compared to previous solutions. Furthermore, we find non-trivial and often systematic misbehavior: (a) we find a total of 637 misbehaving hyperlinks, and (b) we identify 30 colluding groups of users in terms of promoting hyperlinks. Our work is a significant step towards mining online forums and detecting misbehaving users comprehensively.",

In particular, we consider MFE scenarios where at the end of the protocol, either every participant receives every other participant’s item, or no participant receives anything. We analyze the case where a trusted third party (TTP) is optimistically available, although we emphasize that the trust put on the TTP is only regarding the fairness, and our protocols preserve the privacy of the exchanged items against the TTP. In the fair SMPC case, we prove that a malicious TTP can only harm fairness, but not security.We construct an asymptotically optimal multi-party fair exchange protocol that requires a constant number of rounds (in comparison to linear) and O(n2) messages (in comparison to cubic), where n is the number of participating parties. In our protocol, we enable the parties to efficiently exchange any item that can be efficiently put into a verifiable encryption (e.g., signatures on a contract). We show how to apply this protocol on top of any SMPC protocol to achieve fairness with very little overhead (independent of the circuit size). We then generalize our protocol to efficiently handle any exchange topology (participants exchange items with arbitrary other participants). Our protocol guarantees fairness in its strongest sense: even if all n-1 other participants are malicious and colluding with each other, the fairness is still guaranteed.",

However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (EdgeML) algorithms on edge devices facilitate safety-critical applications like building security management and smart city interventions. However, their wired/wireless connections with the Internet make such platforms vulnerable to attacks compromising the embedded software. We find that in the prior works, the issue of regular runtime integrity assessment of the deployed software with negligible EdgeML performance degradation is still unresolved. In this paper, we present PracAttest, a practical runtime attestation framework for embedded devices running compute-heavy EdgeML applications. Unlike the conventional remote attestation schemes that check the entire software in each attestation event, PracAttest segments the software and randomizes the integrity check of these segments over short random attestation intervals. The segmentation coupled with the randomization leads to a novel performance-vs-security trade-off that can be tuned per the EdgeML application’s performance requirements. Additionally, we implement three realistic EdgeML benchmarks for pollution measurement, traffic intersection control, and face identification, using state-of-the-art neural network and computer vision algorithms. We specify and verify security properties for these benchmarks and evaluate the efficacy of PracAttest in attesting the verified software. PracAttest provides 50x-80x speedup over the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of mean attestation time, with negligible impact on application performance. We believe that the novel performance-vs-security trade-off facilitated by PracAttest will expedite the adoption of runtime attestation on edge platforms.",

Software security assurance could benefit by switching from a process-based to an artefact-based approach. Further, security evaluation might need to be more incremental, automated and decentralized.

In this talk, I will describe my recent research that initiates the first systematic effort towards understanding and addressing the security problems in production AD software. I will be focusing on two critical modules: perception and localization, and talk about how we are able to discover novel and practical sensor/physical-world attacks that can cause end-to-end safety impacts such as crashing into obstacles or driving off road.

        "abstract": "Distributed machine learning algorithms that employ Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used in Industry 4.0 applications, such as smart manufacturing. The layers of a DNN can be mapped onto different nodes located in the cloud, edge and shop floor for preserving privacy. The quality of the data that is fed into and processed through the DNN is of utmost importance for critical tasks, such as inspection and quality control. Distributed Data Validation Networks (DDVNs) are used to validate the quality of the data. However, they are prone to single points of failure when an attack occurs. This paper proposes QUDOS, an approach that enhances the security of a distributed DNN that is supported by DDVNs using quorums. The proposed approach allows individual nodes that are corrupted due to an attack to be detected or excluded when the DNN produces an output. Metrics such as corruption factor and success probability of an attack are considered for evaluating the security aspects of DNNs. A simulation study demonstrates that if the number of corrupted nodes is less than a given threshold for decision-making in a quorum, the QUDOS approach always prevents attacks. Furthermore, the study shows that increasing the size of the quorum has a better impact on security than increasing the number of layers. One merit of QUDOS is that it enhances the security of DNNs without requiring any modifications to the algorithm and can therefore be applied to other classes of problems.",

According to the computer modeling and simulation technology, the results show that controlling the core risk factors and blocking the transmission of key risk relationships can reduce the complexity of the whole risk network.

The cloud transcribes these recordings and interprets them as user requests, and sometimes even shares these requests with third-party services. These steps may result in unintended or malicious voice data leaks and in unauthorized actions, such as a purchase. This paper presents MegaMind, a novel extensible platform that lets a user deploy security and privacy extensions locally on their voice assistant. MegaMind's extensions interpose on requests before sending them to the cloud and on responses before delivering them to the user. MegaMind's programming model enables writing powerful extensions with ease, such as one for secure conversations. Additionally, MegaMind protects against malicious extensions by providing two important guarantees, namely permission enforcement and non-interference. We implement MegaMind and integrate it with Amazon Alexa Service SDK. Our evaluation shows that MegaMind achieves a small conversation latency on platforms with adequate compute power, such as a Raspberry Pi 4 and an x86-based laptop.",

Statistical techniques like differential item functioning (DIF) can help identify whether items/questions in an assessment exhibit potential bias by disadvantaging certain groups (e.g. whether item disadvantages woman vs man of equivalent knowledge). While testing companies typically use DIF to identify items to remove, we explored how domain-experts such as curriculum designers could use DIF to better understand how to design instructional materials to better serve students from diverse groups. Using Code.org's online Computer Science Discoveries (CSD) curriculum, we analyzed 139,097 responses from 19,617 students to identify DIF by gender and race in assessment items (e.g. multiple choice questions). Of the 17 items, we identified six that disadvantaged students who reported as female when compared to students who reported as non-binary or male. We also identified that most (13) items disadvantaged AHNP (African/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American/Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander) students compared to WA (white, Asian) students. We then conducted a workshop and interviews with seven curriculum designers and found that they interpreted item bias relative to an intersection of item features and student identity, the broader curriculum, and differing uses for assessments. We interpreted these findings in the broader context of using data on assessment bias to inform domain-experts' efforts to design more equitable learning experiences.",

Contributing to the ongoing discussion on the usability and effectiveness of security and privacy indicators, particularly in the context of systems targeting non-expert users, this paper sheds light on users' evaluation of traffic light-inspired indicators, as a metaphor to represent different privacy states and guarantees, provided by a new system for email end-to-end encryption called p≡p. Using a mixed-methods approach, based on input gathered from 150 participants in three online studies, we highlight the pros and cons of the traffic light semantic in p≡p's context and beyond, and discuss the potential implications on the perceived security and use of such systems.",

        "abstract": "Affected by economic development, the speed of urban renewal is getting faster and faster. Old residential areas left in the early development of some cities not only affect the appearance of the city, but also cause many social problems to a certain extent. Due to the limitations of historical conditions, outdated design concepts and functional aging of landscape space, the landscape space of the old community can no longer meet the requirements of residents for environmental quality in the new era, and can not meet the needs of residents' life and outdoor activities. Therefore, it is imperative to carry out humanized transformation of the landscape space of the old community. As the main place where the elderly live and move, due to the early construction time, the internal supporting facilities of software and hardware do not match the needs of the elderly, and there are many shortcomings in the suitability of outdoor landscape space. Based on the computer aided design technology, this paper analyzes the green landscape of old residential areas, finds out the difficulties in the renovation of old residential areas, and provides feasible schemes and reasonable suggestions for the landscape space renovation of old urban residential areas.",

In total, 24 HCI researchers, located primarily in the United States, participated in an interview, survey, or both. Through a reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four tensions—exploitation, membership, disclosure, and allyship. We explore the complexity involved in each, demonstrating that an equitable endpoint may not be possible, but this work is still worth pursuing when researchers make certain considerations. We emphasize that researchers who work with marginalized people should account for each tension in their research approaches to move forward. Finally, we propose an allyship-oriented approach to research that draws inspiration from discourse occurring in tangential fields and activist spaces and pushes the field into a new paradigm of research with marginalized people.",

However, this procedure occurs over a wireless network, an insecure environment, and susceptible to attacks. Currently, one of the main problems related to offloading is how to perform it safely. By acting in conjunction with the TLS protocol, secure gRPC connections ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data transmitted through a network, which provides greater security for distributed applications. In this work, we conducted experiments that evaluated the performance of secure gRPC connections during the computational offloading procedures in a Mobile Cloud Computing scenario. The tests adopted an Android image manipulation application that performs the offloading into a Go or Java process using the multi-language framework gRPC. The results indicated that the adoption of secure gRPC connections saved up to 9 times the processing time and up to 88% of the mobile device's energy consumption compared to local processing.",

Using computer simulation technology, JSP Application Technology, JavaBean database access technology and database technology, this paper designs and implements a financial learning system that can effectively meet the actual needs of enterprise employees and school teachers and students. The system can effectively reduce the difficulty of enterprises and schools in financial education, improve the learning initiative and enthusiasm of employees and students, and improve the teaching quality of teachers. In order to make the financial learning system of computer simulation system more vivid, a system combining computer simulation technology with computer-aided teaching is proposed. By combining computer simulation technology with computer-aided teaching, the application of computer-based financial learning system based on computer simulation in education is further explored. Provide students with a clearer learning direction and apply computer simulation to computer teaching. The experimental research shows that the test fluctuation of the system is relatively stable, the average value of the maximum transaction response time is about 0.84 seconds, and the probability of successful transaction processing is 100%.",

Qualitative data from respondents of both these groups show that the concerns are mostly similar. However, the factors perceived to alleviate privacy concerns are more varied and nuanced amongst those who have obtained a DTC genetic test. Our data suggest that privacy concerns or lack of concerns are based on complex and multiple considerations including data ownership, access control of data and regulatory authorities of social, political and legal systems.

Since MPC based on secret sharing (SS) achieves high throughput and works fast, many applications have been developed. However, SS-based MPC requires many communication rounds in general, and this becomes a performance bottleneck in real-world applications under high-latency networks. In this paper, we propose SS-based secure three-party computation with almost no preprocessing based on our new (small-)constant-round fundamental gates, by revisiting a framework in a few previous works where a number of parties are assisted by another party who may partially learn secret information. Instead of ordinary logical gates, our fundamental gate is an efficient Equality, for which the result leaks to the third party, and we develop novel two-round constructions of secure building-block protocols (LessThan Comparison, RightShift, Table LookUp, etc.) from the insecure Equality. To show the practicality of our protocols, we implement a secure exact edit distance protocol for two genome strings. Our experiments show that in some network setting our protocol is about 2 times faster (14 times faster taking preprocessing into consideration) than the state-of-the-art SS-based protocol (Ohata and Nuida, FC 2020).",

In this paper, we propose a Biometrics-Authenticated Key Exchange (BAKE) framework, in which a secret key is derived from a user's biometric characteristics that are not necessary to be stored. To protect the privacy of users' biometric characteristics and realize one-round key exchange, we present an Asymmetric Fuzzy Encapsulation Mechanism (AFEM) to encapsulate messages with a public key derived from a biometric secret key, such that only a similar secret key can decapsulate them. To manifest the practicality, we present two AFEM constructions for two types of biometric secret keys and instantiate them with irises and fingerprints, respectively. We perform security analysis of BAKE and show its performance through extensive experiments.",

By reviewing year-long, multiple-site ethnographic studies in the maritime domain conducted since 2015, this paper reflects on the \"reflexivity of account\" and \"professional vision\" as complementary concepts for ensuring that actors' actions and reasonings are designed in such a way that actors-in this case, maritime operators, systems developers, educators, policymakers, and shipowners-are accountable in and through their member groups. Rather than generalizing my findings and my role in the maritime domain as explicit knowledge to help other CSCW researchers in studying engineering projects, the goal of this paper is to seek intersubjective knowledge of my fieldwork to trigger the utilization of CSCW insights as a fundamental basis for facilitating systems design.

Specifically, we present the design of two interactive physical computing artefacts, which we collectively call DataMoves, that enable students, 12-14 years old, to explore number systems and data through embodied movement and dance. Our evaluation of DataMoves, used in tandem with other pedagogical methods, demonstrates that the form of embodied, exploration-based learning adopted has much potential for deepening students’ understandings of computing topics, as well as for shaping positive perceptions of topics that are traditionally considered boring and dull.",

Mutation testing is generally used by software practitioners to assess the robustness of a given test-suite. However, we leverage this technique to systematically evaluate static analysis tools and uncover and document soundness issues. μSE's analysis has found 25 previously undocumented flaws in static data leak detection tools for Android. μSE offers four mutation schemes, namely Reachability, Complex-reachability, TaintSink, and ScopeSink, which determine the locations of seeded mutants. Furthermore, the user can extend μSE by customizing the API calls targeted by the mutation analysis. μSE is also practical, as it makes use of filtering techniques based on compilation and execution criteria that reduces the number of ineffective mutations.

        "abstract": "In finance, leverage is the ratio between assets borrowed from others and one's own assets. A matching situation is present in software: by using free open-source software (FOSS) libraries a developer leverages on other people's code to multiply the offered functionalities with a much smaller own codebase. In finance as in software, leverage magnifies profits when returns from borrowing exceed costs of integration, but it may also magnify losses, in particular in the presence of security vulnerabilities. We aim to understand the level of technical leverage in the FOSS ecosystem and whether it can be a potential source of security vulnerabilities. Also, we introduce two metrics change distance and change direction to capture the amount and the evolution of the dependency on third-party libraries. The application of the proposed metrics on 8494 distinct library versions from the FOSS Maven-based Java libraries shows that small and medium libraries (less than 100KLoC) have disproportionately more leverage on FOSS dependencies in comparison to large libraries. We show that leverage pays off as leveraged libraries only add a 4% delay in the time interval between library releases while providing four times more code than their own. However, libraries with such leverage (i.e., 75% of libraries in our sample) also have 1.6 higher odds of being vulnerable in comparison to the libraries with lower leverage. We provide an online demo for computing the proposed metrics for real-world software libraries available under the following URL: https://techleverage.eu/.",

The forthcoming 5G is expected to allow low-power massive IoT devices to produce high volumes of data that can be transmitted over ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. However, IoT systems encounter several security and privacy issues to prevent unauthorized access to IoT nodes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel blockchain-based architecture that leverages Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for securing IoT transactions. A novel security appliance is introduced in a form of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) for improving the scalability and performance of IoT networks. Then, we introduce a novel consensus algorithm to detect and report suspected IoT nodes and mitigate malicious traffic. We evaluate and compare our proposed solution against three well-known consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), and Proof of Stake (PoS). We demonstrate that the proposed solution provides substantially lower latency and higher throughput as well as trustworthy IoT communication.",

Being partially rooted in CS conferences, \"AI ethics\" (AIE) conferences such as FAccT and AIES have quickly become distinct venues where AI's societal implications are discussed and solutions proposed. However, it is largely unknown if these conferences improve upon the historical representational issues of traditional CS venues. In this work, we explore AIE conferences' evolution and compare them across demographic characteristics, publication content, and citation patterns. We find that AIE conferences have increased their internal topical diversity and impact on other CS conferences. Importantly, AIE conferences are highly differentiable, covering topics not represented in other venues. However, and perhaps contrary to the field's aspirations, white authors are more common while seniority and black researchers are represented similarly to CS venues. Our results suggest that AIE conferences could increase efforts to attract more diverse authors, especially considering their sizable roots in CS.",

        "abstract": "Computer systems often provide hardware support for isolation mechanisms such as privilege levels, virtual memory, or enclaved execution. Over the past years, several successful software-based side-channel attacks have been developed that break, or at least significantly weaken, the isolation that these mechanisms offer. Extending a processor with new architectural or micro-architectural features brings a risk of introducing new software-based side-channel attacks.This article studies the problem of extending a processor with new features without weakening the security of the isolation mechanisms that the processor offers. Our solution is heavily based on techniques from research on programming languages. More specifically, we propose to use the programming language concept of full abstraction as a general formal criterion for the security of a processor extension. We instantiate the proposed criterion to the concrete case of extending a microprocessor that supports enclaved execution with secure interruptibility. This is a very relevant instantiation, as several recent papers have shown that interruptibility of enclaves leads to a variety of software-based side-channel attacks. We propose a design for interruptible enclaves and prove that it satisfies our security criterion. We also implement the design on an open-source enclave-enabled microprocessor and evaluate the cost of our design in terms of performance and hardware size.",

        "abstract": "Data security is an indispensable part of non-volatile memory (NVM) systems. However, implementing data security efficiently on NVM is challenging, since we have to guarantee the consistency of user data and the related security metadata. Existing consistency schemes ignore the recoverability of the SGX style integrity tree (SIT) and the access correlation between metadata blocks, thereby generating unnecessary NVM write traffic. In this article, we propose SecNVM, an efficient and write-friendly metadata crash consistency scheme for secure NVM. SecNVM utilizes the observation that for a lazily updated SIT, the lost tree nodes after a crash can be recovered by the corresponding child nodes in NVM. It reduces the SIT persistency overhead through a restrained write-back metadata cache and exploits the SIT inter-layer dependency for recovery. Next, leveraging the strong access correlation between the counter and DMAC, SecNVM improves the efficiency of security metadata access through a novel collaborative counter-DMAC scheme. In addition, it adopts a lightweight address tracker to reduce the cost of address tracking for fast recovery. Experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, SecNVM improves the performance and decreases write traffic a lot, and achieves an acceptable recovery time.",

Contrasting this trend, we designed a social practice-based, worker-centered, and well-being-oriented self-scheduling system which gives healthcare workers more control during shift planning. In a following nine month appropriation study, we found that workers who were cautious about their social standing in the group or who had a more spontaneous personal lifestyle used our system less often than others. Moreover, we revealed several conflict prevention practices and suggest to shift the focus away from a competitive shift distribution paradigm towards supporting these pro-social practices.

        "abstract": "Online Q&A fora such as Stack Overflow assist developers to solve their faced coding problems. Despite the advantages, Stack Overflow has the potential to provide insecure code snippets that, if reused, can compromise the security of the entire software.  We present Dicos, an accurate approach by examining the change history of Stack Overflow posts for discovering insecure code snippets. When a security issue was detected in a post, the insecure code is fixed to be safe through user discussions, leaving a change history. Inspired by this process, Dicos first extracts the change history from the Stack Overflow post, and then analyzes the history whether it contains security patches, by utilizing pre-selected features that can effectively identify security patches. Finally, when such changes are detected, Dicos determines that the code snippet before applying the security patch is insecure.  To evaluate Dicos, we collected 1,958,283 Stack Overflow posts tagged with C, C++, and Android. When we applied Dicos on the collected posts, Dicos discovered 12,458 insecure posts (i.e., 14,719 insecure code snippets) from the collected posts with 91% precision and 93% recall. We further confirmed that the latest versions of 151 out of 2,000 popular C/C++ open-source software contain at least one insecure code snippet taken from Stack Overflow, being discovered by Dicos. Our proposed approach, Dicos, can contribute to preventing further propagation of insecure codes and thus creating a safe code reuse environment.",

        "abstract": "Of late, more and more sensitive data have been connected with cyberspace, which has led to an increase in the importance of secure cloud computing. This paper shows an overall scheme of securely managing big data in a cloud supported by two technological methods, secret sharing and verifiable computing. While each of them was implemented and analyzed individually in previous works, this paper shows a comprehensive framework combining them to realize both security and efficiency in cloud data management. Specifically, secret sharing enables hiding the outsourced encrypted data from any unauthorized entity, and verifiable computing enable resource-constraint users to access the database in which the correctness is undoubtedly confirmed. This paper also compares the database scheme based on blockchain and the proposed method in terms of performance. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme entirely based on the conventional Internet computes the operations lighter than the blockchain scheme.",

        "abstract": "Computer Science education (CSed) often aims to position youth as designers, creators, and those with a voice in their world. But do youth have opportunities to design, create, and have voice around the shape of their CSed learning experiences? In this study, we explore ways that school districts engage youth to contribute to the shaping and enactment of their CS instructional systems, efforts districts make to have these leadership roles create impact within these systems, and the tensions associated with these processes. Through in depth analysis of five district case studies, our findings highlight variance around the nature of leadership roles, how access to leadership roles is structured, student autonomy within and ownership over leadership roles, how roles reach into and index differential power over instructional systems, and how district processes of scaffolding and infrastructuring mediate the ultimate impact that students in these roles are able to have on CS instructional systems. Findings also surfaced ways that district actors dealt with a number of tensions associated with student leadership within CS instructional systems. This study provides educators, administrators, and researchers with an expansive view of the potential for students to play legitimate roles within the context of system-wide instructional efforts around CS, and aims to expand conceptions of ‘equitable computer science’—up to this point largely conceived of through the lenses of access to, participation in, and experiences of CS learning—to focus on equity as also being about who has ‘a seat at the table’ when it comes to CS.",

Despite being a critical component of the day-to-day care of home-dwelling adults, these workers often feel underappreciated and isolated on the job and come from low-income and marginalized backgrounds. Leveraging the support of peers is one potential way to empower HCWs, but peer support encompasses a broad range of activities and aspects. Traditional conceptions of workplace support may not be appropriate to the home care context, as HCWs are a distributed workforce who have few opportunities to interact with each other. In this study, we explore how HCWs value and conceptualize peer support. Our findings demonstrate the importance of peer support in performing the emotional labor of home care work and ongoing attempts to strategically frame the home care profession as essential and medical in nature. Our results ground design implications for technology-enabled peer support based on the power dynamics of our participants' context and allow us to engage with issues where technology design for empowerment intersects with exploitation in distributed or crowd work, emotional labor, and tacit knowledge.",

To remotely check the integrity of cloud storage, plenty of protocols have been proposed, implemented by checking the equation constructed by the aggregated blocks, tags, and indices. However, the verifier only has the knowledge of the indices of the audited blocks and tags, which thus requires the cloud to store both data blocks and tags for integrity verification. In this article, we present a compressive secure cloud storage protocol inspired by Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) cryptosystem. Since the aggregated blocks can be reconstructed from the aggregated tags without the help of data indices, the cloud can only store data tags for providing the verifiable integrity proof. In this way, communication and storage costs can be hugely reduced and user private information can be hidden from the cloud. Furthermore, the proposed protocol only contains a few basic algebraic operations, making it highly efficient. We also provide formal security proof of the proposed protocol regarding forge, replay and replace attacks. In addition, we explore a new technique to support data dynamics. Furthermore, we establish a generic framework of compressive secure cloud storage protocols. Finally, we provide the theoretical analysis and experimental results, which further validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.",

This shall allow us, in the long-run, to better understand the extent to which security activities are (or should be) part of automated pipelines. In particular, we mine publicly available OSS repositories and survey a sample of project maintainers to better understand the role that security activities and their related tools play in their CI pipelines. To increase transparency and allow other researchers to replicate our study (and to take different perspectives), we further disclose our research artefacts. Our results indicate that security activities in enterprise-driven OSS projects are scarce and protection coverage is rather low. Only 6.83% of the analyzed 8,243 projects apply security automation in their CI pipelines, even though maintainers consider security to be rather important. This alerts industry to keep the focus on vulnerabilities of 3rd Party software and it opens space for other improvements of practice which we outline in this manuscript.",

        "abstract": "Secure multiparty generation of an RSA biprime is a challenging task, which increasingly receives attention, due to the numerous privacy-preserving applications that require it. In this work, we construct a new protocol for the RSA biprime generation task, secure against a malicious adversary, who can corrupt any subset of protocol participants. Our protocol is designed with generic multiparty computation (MPC), making it both platform-independent and allowing for weaker security models to be assumed (e.g., honest majority), should the application scenario require it. By carefully \"postponing\" the check of possible inconsistencies in the shares provided by malicious adversaries, we achieve noteworthy efficiency improvements. Concretely, we are able to produce additive sharings of the prime candidates, from multiplicative sharings via a semi-honest multiplication, without degrading the overall (active) security of our protocol. This is the core of our sieving technique, increasing the probability of our protocol sampling a biprime. Similarly, we perform the first biprimality test, requiring several repetitions, without checking input share consistency, and perform the more costly consistency check only in case of success of the Jacobi symbol based biprimality test. Moreover, we propose a protocol to convert an additive sharing over a ring, into an additive sharing over the integers. Besides being a necessary sub-protocol for the RSA biprime generation, this conversion protocol is of independent interest. The cost analysis of our protocol demonstrated that our approach improves the current state-of-the-art (Chen et al.-Crypto 2020), in terms of communication efficiency. Concretely, for the two-party case with malicious security, and primes of 2048bits, our protocol improves communication by a factor of ~37.",

However Intellectual Properties and data are being used and communicated. So current security models require the client to trust the cloud provider blindly by disclosing sensitive information. In addition, the lack of strong authentication and access control mechanisms, for both the client and the provided FPGA in current solutions, is a major security drawback. To enhance security measures and privacy between the client, the cloud provider and the FPGA, an additional entity needs to be introduced: the trusted authority. Its role is to authenticate the client-FPGA pair and isolate them from the cloud provider. With our novel OAuth 2.0-based access delegation solution for FPGA-accelerated clouds, a remote confidential FPGA environment with a token-based access can be created for the client. Our solution allows to manage and securely allocate heterogeneous resource pools with enhanced privacy & confidentiality for the client.

In particular, the NVIDIA Tegra K1/X1/X2 embedded GPU platforms, which are also treated as edge computing devices, are now widely used in embedded environments such as mobile phones, game consoles, and vehicle-mounted systems to support high-dimension display, auto-pilot, and so on. Meanwhile, with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for cryptographic operations for secure communications and authentications between edge computing nodes and IoT devices is also expanding. In this contribution, instead of the conventional implementations based on FPGA, ASIC, and ARM CPUs, we provide an alternative solution for cryptographic implementation on embedded GPU devices. Targeting the new cipher suite added in TLS 1.3, we implement Edwards25519/448 and Curve25519/448 on an edge computing platform, embedded GPU NVIDIA Tegra X2, where various performance optimizations are customized for the target platform, including a novel parallel method for the register-limited embedded GPUs.

In this paper, we introduce a new DSSE scheme such that documents containing different keywords can be modified, by extending the KSOY scheme. In addition, since Kurosawa et al.'s UC definition does not guarantee forward security, we extend their UC definition to guarantee forward security, and prove (weak) equivalence between the game-based definition of forward security and our UC definition. We also show that the proposed scheme satisfies UC security by proving the game-based definition.",

Specifically, liveness detection against spoofed artifacts is one of the most challenging tasks as many existing methods cannot conclusively assess the user's physical presence in unsupervised environments. Even though several methods have been proposed for tackling PA with motion challenges and 3D mapping, most of them require expensive depth sensors and fail to detect sophisticated 3D reconstruction attacks. We present a software-based face PA Detection (PAD) method named \"Your Eyes Show What Your Eyes See (Y-EYES),\" which creates challenges and detects meaningful corneal specular reflection responses from human eyes. To detect human liveness, Y-EYES creates multiple screen image patterns as a challenge, then captures the response of corneal specular reflections using the front camera and analyzes the images using lightweight Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Y-EYES system components include challenge pattern generation, reflection image augmentation (e.g., super-resolution), and ML-based analyses. We have implemented Y-EYES as Android, iOS, and web apps. Our extensive experimental results show that Y-EYES achieves liveness detection with high accuracy at around 200 ms against various types of sophisticated PA. Y-EYES liveness detection can be applied for multiple contactless biometric authentications accurately and efficiently without any costly extra sensors.",

        "abstract": "The supervisory software is widely used in industrial control systems (ICSs) to manage field devices such as PLC controllers. Once compromised, it could be misused to control or manipulate these physical devices maliciously, endangering manufacturing process or even human lives. Therefore, extensive security testing of supervisory software is crucial for the safe operation of ICS. However, fuzzing ICS supervisory software is challenging due to the prevalent use of proprietary protocols. Without the knowledge of the program states and packet formats, it is difficult to enter the deep states for effective fuzzing.  In this work, we present a fuzzing framework to automatically discover implementation bugs residing in the communication protocols between the supervisory software and the field devices. To avoid heavy human efforts in reverse-engineering the proprietary protocols, the proposed approach constructs a state-book based on the readily-available execution trace of the supervisory software and the corresponding inputs. Then, we propose a state selection algorithm to find the protocol states that are more likely to have bugs. Our fuzzer distributes more budget on those interesting states. To quickly reach the interesting states, traditional snapshot-based method does not work since the communication protocols are time sensitive. We address this issue by synchronously managing external events (GUI operations and network traffic) during the fuzzing loop. We have implemented a prototype and used it to fuzz the supervisory software of four popular ICS platforms. We have found 13 bugs and received 3 CVEs, 2 are classified as critical (CVSS3.x score CRITICAL 9.8) and affected 40 different products.",

However, bump devices cannot be used to authenticate incoming broadcast traffic, are complex to manage, and one bump is needed per host. In this work, we propose a virtual bump-like solution called vBump, which allows to insert virtual bumps in front of Ethernet-based legacy ICS devices. The vBumps can be used to limit traffic to whitelisted destinations, inspect all traffic on or above Link-layer like a centralized intrusion detection systems (or monitoring systems), or even police the traffic like a centralized intrusion prevention systems. In particular, this also allows the network to apply fine-grained control on traffic between nodes that need to be in the same Link-layer broadcast domain. Compared to traditional bumps, vBumps do not require any changes in physical network topology, and the central server's global view allows for more informed decision, with less computational constraints. We implement the system in a high-fidelity ICS testbed, and demonstrate its capabilities to support even time-critical protection control traffic in smart grids. Our system can handle traffic rates of 150Mbps with one-way delay of ~1ms.",

Analysis suggests that monthly salary income, job types, satisfaction with opportunity for training, satisfaction with working environment, satisfaction with colleague relationship as well as satisfaction with higher and lower ranks all have significant impact on job satisfaction, while the rest of the employment quality indicator shows negligible correlation. Subjective index variables show significant influence over migrant workers’ job satisfaction. Meanwhile, gender differences exist in impact of employment quality on job satisfaction. Satisfaction with opportunity for training and satisfaction with colleague relationship significantly impact female migrant workers’ job satisfaction while satisfaction with colleague relationship and satisfaction with higher and lower ranks significantly impact male migrant workers’ job satisfaction. Among migrant workers’ individual characteristics, education level and work location have an impact on job satisfaction, but the impact is not significant compared to the employment quality indicators.",

While the method is general, we demonstrate it in a 3-server setting with an honest majority, with either semi-honest security or full security. A major technical contribution of our work is replacing the usage of secure sort protocols with secure shuffles, which are much more efficient. Full security against malicious behavior is achieved by adding an efficient verification for the shuffle operation, and computing circuits using fully secure protocols. We demonstrate the applicability of this technology by implementing two major algorithms: computing breadth-first search (BFS), which is also useful for contact tracing on private contact graphs, and computing maximal independent set (MIS). We implement both algorithms, with both semi-honest and full security, and run them within seconds on graphs of millions of elements.",

        "abstract": "Browser extensions are popular to enhance users' browsing experience. By design, they have access to security- and privacy-critical APIs to perform tasks that web applications cannot traditionally do. Even though web pages and extensions are isolated, they can communicate through messages. Specifically, a vulnerable extension can receive messages from another extension or web page, under the control of an attacker. Thus, these communication channels are a way for a malicious actor to elevate their privileges to the capabilities of an extension, which can lead to, e.g., universal cross-site scripting or sensitive user data exfiltration. To automatically detect such security and privacy threats in benign-but-buggy extensions, we propose our static analyzer DoubleX. DoubleX defines an Extension Dependence Graph (EDG), which abstracts extension code with control and data flows, pointer analysis, and models the message interactions within and outside of an extension. This way, we can leverage this graph to track and detect suspicious data flows between external actors and sensitive APIs in browser extensions. We evaluated DoubleX on 154,484 Chrome extensions, where it flags 278 extensions as having a suspicious data flow. Overall, we could verify that 89% of these flows can be influenced by external actors (i.e., an attacker). Based on our threat model, we subsequently demonstrate exploitability for 184 extensions. Finally, we evaluated DoubleX on a labeled vulnerable extension set, where it accurately detects almost 93% of known flaws.",

To overcome this issue, we study a generalized compiler correctness definition, which uses source and target traces drawn from potentially different sets and connected by an arbitrary relation. We set out to understand what guarantees this generalized compiler correctness definition gives us when instantiated with a non-trivial relation on traces. When this trace relation is not equality, it is no longer possible to preserve the trace properties of the source program unchanged. Instead, we provide a generic characterization of the target trace property ensured by correctly compiling a program that satisfies a given source property, and dually, of the source trace property one is required to show to obtain a certain target property for the compiled code. We show that this view on compiler correctness can naturally account for undefined behavior, resource exhaustion, different source and target values, side channels, and various abstraction mismatches. Finally, we show that the same generalization also applies to many definitions of secure compilation, which characterize the protection of a compiled program linked against adversarial code.",

We introduce Molecule, the first serverless computing system utilizing heterogeneous computers. Molecule enables both general-purpose devices (e.g., Nvidia DPU) and domain-specific accelerators (e.g., FPGA and GPU) for serverless applications that significantly improve function density (50% higher) and application performance (up to 34.6x). To achieve these results, we first propose XPU-Shim, a distributed shim to bridge the gap between underlying multi-OS systems (when using general-purpose devices) and our serverless runtime (i.e., Molecule). We further introduce vectorized sandbox, a sandbox abstraction to abstract hardware heterogeneity (when using domain-specific accelerators). Moreover, we also review state-of-the-art serverless optimizations on startup and communication latency and overcome the challenges to implement them on heterogeneous computers. We have implemented Molecule on real platforms with Nvidia DPUs and Xilinx FPGAs and evaluate it using benchmarks and real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Several emerging proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain protocols rely on a ''parallel-chain'' architecture for scaling, where instead of a single chain, multiple chains are run in parallel and aggregated. A key requirement of practical PoW blockchains is to adapt to mining power variations over time (Bitcoin's total mining power has increased by a 1014 factor over the decade). In this paper, we consider the design of provably secure parallel-chain protocols which can adapt to such mining power variations. The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment rule adjusts the difficulty target of block mining periodically to get a constant mean inter-block time. While superficially simple, the rule has proved itself to be sophisticated and successfully secure, both in practice and in theory. We show that natural adaptations of the Bitcoin adjustment rule to the parallel-chain case open the door to subtle, but catastrophic safety and liveness breaches. We uncover a meta-design principle that allow us to design variable mining difficulty protocols for three popular PoW blockchain proposals (Prism, OHIE, Fruitchains) inside a common rubric. The principle has three components: (M1) a pivot chain, based on which blocks in all chains choose difficulty, (M2) a monotonicity condition for referencing pivot chain blocks and (M3) translating additional protocol aspects from using levels (depth) to using \"difficulty levels\". We show that protocols employing a subset of these principles may have catastrophic failures. The security of the designs is also proved using a common rubric -- the key technical challenge involves analyzing the interaction between the pivot chain and the other chains, as well as bounding the sudden changes in difficulty target experienced in non-pivot chains. We empirically investigate the responsivity of the new mining difficulty rule via simulations based on historical Bitcoin data, and find that the protocol very effectively controls the forking rate across all the chains.",

With the development of VANETs, how to achieve secure and efficient machine learning in VANETs is an urgent problem to be solved. Besides, how to ensure that users obtain the accurate results of machine learning is also a challenge. Based on the homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computing technology, a flexible and privacy-preserving collaborative filtering scheme is proposed to accomplish the personalized recommendation for users, which is based on users’ interests and locations. On the one hand, the data can be updated by users flexibly to ensure the freshness and accuracy of the dataset of interest. On the other hand, the weighted values of user interest can be safely sorted to improve the accuracy of collaborative filtering effectively. Moreover, a novel collaborative filtering algorithm based on the homomorphic encryption technology is designed, which can guarantee that the calculated decryption result by machine learning is the same as the plaintext. Note that the privacy of user data can be preserved during machine learning in this algorithm. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient for collaborative filtering in cloud computing in VANETs.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of the Internet of Things has led to demand for high-speed data transformation. Serving this purpose is the Tactile Internet, which facilitates data transfer in extra-low latency. In particular, a Tactile Internet based on software-defined networking (SDN) has been broadly deployed because of the proven benefits of SDN in flexible and programmable network management. However, the vulnerabilities of SDN also threaten the security of the Tactile Internet. Specifically, an SDN controller relies on the network status (provided by the underlying switches) to make network decisions, e.g., calculating a routing path to deliver data in the Tactile Internet. Hence, the attackers can compromise the switches to jeopardize the SDN and further attack Tactile Internet systems. For example, an attacker can compromise switches to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks to overwhelm the SDN controller, which will disrupt all the applications in the Tactile Internet. In pursuit of a more secure Tactile Internet, the problem of abnormal SDN switches in the Tactile Internet is analyzed in this article, including the cause of abnormal switches and their influences on different network layers. Then we propose an approach that leverages the messages sent by all switches to identify abnormal switches, which adopts a linear structure to store historical messages at a relatively low cost. By mapping each flow message to the flow establishment model, our method can effectively identify malicious SDN switches in the Tactile Internet and thus enhance its security.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the secure memory architecture for GPUs and point out that conventional CPU secure memory architecture can not be directly adopted to the GPUs. The key reasons include: (1) accessing the security metadata, including encryption counters, message authentication codes (MACs) and integrity trees, requires significant memory bandwidth, which may lead to severe bandwidth competition with normal data accesses and degrade the GPU performance; (2) contemporary GPUs use partitioned memory organization, which results in storage and coherence problems for encryption counters and integrity trees since different partitions may need to update the same counter/integrity tree blocks; and (3) the existing split-counter block organization is not friendly to sectored caches, which are commonly used in GPU for bandwidth savings. Based on these observations, we propose partitioned and sectored security metadata (PSSM), which has two components: (a) using the offset addresses (referred to as local addresses) within each partition, instead of the virtual or physical addresses, to generate the metadata so as to solve the counter or integrity tree storage and coherence problem and (b) reorganizing the security metadata to make them friendly to the sectored cache structure so as to reduce the memory bandwidth consumption of metadata accesses. With these proposed schemes, the performance overhead of secure GPU memory is reduced from 59.22% to 16.84% on average. If only memory encryption is required, the performance overhead is reduced from 29.53% to 5.18%.",

Unfortunately, these neural networks are uninterpretable models, whose decision process is completely opaque to security experts, which obstructs their practical adoption. Recently, several methods have been proposed for explaining models of machine learning. However, it is unclear whether these methods are suitable for GNNs and support the task of vulnerability discovery. In this paper we present a framework for evaluating explanation methods on GNNs. We develop a set of criteria for comparing graph explanations and linking them to properties of source code. Based on these criteria, we conduct an experimental study of nine regular and three graph-specific explanation methods. Our study demonstrates that explaining GNNs is a non-trivial task and all evaluation criteria play a role in assessing their efficacy. We further show that graph-specific explanations relate better to code semantics and provide more information to a security expert than regular methods.",

As a result, even users with access to E2EE tools turn to less secure alternatives for sending private information. To investigate these issues, we conducted a 357-participant online user study analyzing how explanations of security impact user perceptions. In a between-subjects design, we varied the terminology used to detail the security mechanism, whether encryption was on by default, and the prominence of security in an app-store-style description page. We collected participants' perceptions of the tool's utility for privacy, security against adversaries, and whether use of the tool would be seen as \"paranoid.'' Compared to \"secure,'' describing the tool as \"encrypted'' or \"military-grade encrypted'' increased perceptions that it was appropriate for privacy-sensitive tasks, whereas describing it more precisely as \"end-to-end encrypted'' did not. However, \"military-grade encrypted'' was also associated with a greater perception of tool use as paranoid. Overall, we find that --- compared to prior work from 2006 --- the social stigma associated with encrypted communication has largely disappeared.",

In this paper, we introduce EdGENI, an educational experiment solution built on top of GENI. EdGENI introduces a desktop environment to the GENI VM and allows users to save, duplicate, and share VM environments with other users. Furthermore, EdGENI also introduces a client application, PuTTY Connect, to simplify the process of making VM connections. These features improve the user experience and extend the user base of GENI, thus delivering a generalized experiment platform for computer education.

        "abstract": "Software protections against side-channel and physical attacks are essential to the development of secure applications. Such protections are meaningful at machine code or micro-architectural level, but they typically do not carry observable semantics at source level. This renders them susceptible to miscompilation, and security engineers embed input/output side-effects to prevent optimizing compilers from altering them. Yet these side-effects are error-prone and compiler-dependent. The current practice involves analyzing the generated machine code to make sure security or privacy properties are still enforced. These side-effects may also be too expensive in fine-grained protections such as control-flow integrity. We introduce observations of the program state that are intrinsic to the correct execution of security protections, along with means to specify and preserve observations across the compilation flow. Such observations complement the input/output semantics-preservation contract of compilers. We introduce an opacification mechanism to preserve and enforce a partial ordering of observations. This approach is compatible with a production compiler and does not incur any modification to its optimization passes. We validate the effectiveness and performance of our approach on a range of benchmarks, expressing the secure compilation of these applications in terms of observations to be made at specific program points.",

        "abstract": "AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) offers protection mechanisms for virtual machines in untrusted environments through memory and register encryption. To separate security-sensitive operations from software executing on the main x86 cores, SEV leverages the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). This paper introduces a new approach to attack SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs) by targeting the AMD-SP. We present a voltage glitching attack that allows an attacker to execute custom payloads on the AMD-SPs of all microarchitectures that support SEV currently on the market (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). The presented methods allow us to deploy a custom SEV firmware on the AMD-SP, which enables an adversary to decrypt a VM's memory. Furthermore, using our approach, we can extract endorsement keys of SEV-enabled CPUs, which allows us to fake attestation reports or to pose as a valid target for VM migration without requiring physical access to the target host. Moreover, we reverse-engineered the Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK) mechanism introduced with SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). The VCEK binds the endorsement keys to the firmware version of TCB components relevant for SEV. Building on the ability to extract the endorsement keys, we show how to derive valid VCEKs for arbitrary firmware versions. With our findings, we prove that SEV cannot adequately protect confidential data in cloud environments from insider attackers, such as rogue administrators, on currently available CPUs.",

In particular, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) expanded dramatically. Resource restrictions on IoT devices and the insufficiency of software security solutions raise the need for smart Hardware-Assisted Security (HAS) solutions. These solutions target one or more of the three C’s of IoT devices: Communication, Control, and Computation. Communication is an essential technology in the development of IoT. Bluetooth is a widely-used wireless communication protocol in small portable devices due to its low energy consumption and high transfer rates. In this work, we propose a supervisory framework to monitor and verify the operation of a Bluetooth system-on-chip (SoC) in real-time. To verify the operation of the Bluetooth SoC, we classify its transmission state in real-time to ensure a secure connection. Our overall classification accuracy is measured as 98.7%. We study both power supply current (IVDD) and RF domains to maximize the classification performance and minimize the overhead of our proposed supervisory system.",

        "abstract": "Understanding users' perception of app behaviors is an important step to detect data access that violates user expectations. While existing works have used various proxies to infer user expectations (e.g., by analyzing app descriptions), how real-world users perceive an app's data access when they interact with graphical user interfaces (UI) has not been fully explored. In this paper, we aimed to fill this gap by directly measuring how end-users perceive app behaviors based on graphical UI elements via extensive user studies. The results are used to build an automated tool - GUIBAT (Graphical User Interface Behavioral Analysis Tool) - that detects sensitive resource accesses that violate user expectations. We conducted three user studies in total (N=904). The first two user studies were used to build a semantic mapping between user expectations of sensitive resource accesses and the common graphical UI elements (N=459). The third user study (N=445) was used to validate the performance of GUIBAT in predicting user expectations. By comparing user expectations and the actual app behavior (inferred by static program analysis) for 47,909 Android apps, we found that 75.38% of the apps have at least one unexpected sensitive resource access in which third-party libraries attributed to 46.13%. Our analysis lays a concrete foundation for modeling user expectations based on UI elements. We show the urgent need for more transparent UI designs to better inform users of data access, and call for new tools to support app developers in this endeavor.",

        "abstract": "Cryptographic techniques have the potential to enable distrusting parties to collaborate in fundamentally new ways, but their practical implementation poses numerous challenges. An important class of such cryptographic techniques is known as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Developing Secure MPC applications in realistic scenarios requires extensive knowledge spanning multiple areas of cryptography and systems. And while the steps to arrive at a solution for a particular application are often straightforward, it remains difficult to make the implementation efficient, and tedious to apply those same steps to a slightly different application from scratch. Hence, it is an important problem to design platforms for implementing Secure MPC applications with minimum effort and using techniques accessible to non-experts in cryptography.  In this paper, we present the HACCLE (High Assurance Compositional Cryptography: Languages and Environments) toolchain, specifically targeted to MPC applications. HACCLE contains an embedded domain-specific language Harpoon, for software developers without cryptographic expertise to write MPC-based programs, and uses Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) for code generation.  Harpoon programs are compiled into acyclic circuits represented in HACCLE’s Intermediate Representation (HIR) that serves as an abstraction over different cryptographic protocols such as secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, or garbled circuits. Implementations of different cryptographic protocols serve as different backends of our toolchain. The extensible design of HIR allows cryptographic experts to plug in new primitives and protocols to realize computation. And the use of standard metaprogramming techniques lowers the development effort significantly.  We have implemented Harpoon and HACCLE, and used them to program interesting applications (e.g., secure auction) and key computation components of Secure MPC applications (e.g., matrix-vector multiplication and merge sort). We show that the performance is improved by using our optimization strategies and heuristics.",

        "abstract": "Energy storage provides an effective way of shifting temporal energy demands and supplies, which enables significant cost reduction under time-of-use energy pricing plans. Despite its promising benefits, the cost of present energy storage remains expensive, presenting a major obstacle to practical deployment. A more viable solution to improve the cost-effectiveness is by sharing energy storage, such as community sharing, cloud energy storage and peer-to-peer sharing. However, revealing private energy demand data to an external energy storage operator may compromise user privacy, and is susceptible to data misuses and breaches. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to support energy storage sharing with privacy protection, based on privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation. We present an integrated solution to enable privacy-preserving energy storage sharing, such that energy storage service scheduling and cost-sharing can be attained without the knowledge of individual users' demands. It also supports auditing and verification by the grid operator via blockchain. Furthermore, our privacy-preserving solution can safeguard against a majority of dishonest users, who may collude in cheating, without requiring a trusted third-party. We implemented our solution as a smart contract on real-world Ethereum blockchain platform, and provided empirical evaluation in this paper1.",

Our analysis results in the identification of 49 covert channels, by applying a covert channel pattern-based taxonomy. The summary and comparison based on nine selected key attributes show that NTP is a plausible carrier for covert channels. The analysis results are evaluated in regards to common behavior of NTP implementations in six major operating systems. Two channels are selected and implemented to be evaluated in network test-beds. By hiding encrypted high entropy data in a high entropy field of NTP we show in our first assessment that practically undetectable channels can be implemented in NTP, motivating the required further research. In our evaluation, we analyze 40,000 NTP server responses from public NTP server providers. We discuss the general approach of the research community that detection of covert channels is the more promising countermeasure, compared to active suppression of covert channels. Therefore, normalization approaches and a secure network environment are introduced.",

However, BGP protocol, as a current standard inter-domain routing protocol, lacks security considerations at the beginning of its design and does not authenticate routing messages. Because the BGP Community attribute is widely used, researchers have found a variety of new routing attacks using the Community attribute. This kind of attack is more covert and flexible, the detection mechanism is difficult to detect its existence, and the current trusted verification scheme can not completely defend against this kind of attack. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a BGP Community attribute authentication scheme based on blockchain. This scheme authenticates the use of BGP Community attributes based on the blockchain smart contract for the first time. Based on the routing source authentication provided by the routing source authentication mechanism, this scheme further puts forward the concept of \"the right to know about using\". Through the agent authentication mechanism, it can effectively resist a variety of new routing attacks without changing the existing BGP routing protocol.",

At the core of the IBM Cloud for Financial services is the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services. This controls framework defines technical and operational controls that \"validated\" IBM Cloud Services comply to. Independent software vendors can then leverage these cloud services to build FS Cloud compliant solutions that also need to comply to the controls of the controls framework. This enables financial institutions, and their technology ecosystem partners, to securely and confidently transact with each other. The purpose of this 90 minute workshop was to provide attendees guidance on how to build and operate secure, resilient, and regulatory compliant solutions by using the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. In this workshop, attendees were introduced to the IBM Cloud for Financial Services and the types of security and compliance controls included in the controls framework. They learned about the IBM Cloud infrastructure and platform services that have been designated as FS validated. Examples of these services include the Virtual Private Cloud compute and related networking and storage options, Hyper Protect Crypto Services, and IBM Cloud databases to name a few. Guidance was provided on how to leverage these validated services and other 3rd party software components to architect secure and resilient solutions on the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. The information provided during the workshop along with useful references that provide detailed information, would enable attendees develop and operate solutions on the IBM Cloud for Financial Services and ensure that they are compliant with the controls framework.",

To this end, we present findings from a qualitative inquiry conducted with older adults and members of technology-rich middle-income households in urban India, where technology users have been shown to engage in relatively more social SP practices. Our research examines the collaborative behaviors enacted by different members of the household for protection from SP threats. In particular, we show how self-appointed family technology managers straddle the line between stewardship and paternalism in their efforts to protect older adults from perceived digital threats.

However, the plethora of embedded devices used in these systems leads to considerable hardware and maintenance costs. To reduce these costs, it is necessary to consolidate applications and functionalities that are currently implemented on individual embedded devices. Especially in mixed-criticality systems, consolidating applications on a single device is highly challenging and requires strong isolation to ensure the security and safety of each application. Existing isolation solutions, such as partitioning designs for ARM-based microcontrollers, do not meet these requirements. In this paper, we present SafeTEE, a novel approach to enable security- and safety-critical applications on a single embedded device. We leverage hardware mechanisms of commercially available ARM-based microcontrollers to strongly isolate applications on individual cores. This makes SafeTEE the first solution to provide strong isolation for multiple applications in terms of security as well as safety. We thoroughly evaluate our prototype of SafeTEE for the most recent ARM microcontrollers using a standard microcontroller benchmark suite.",

Thus, many technological advance companies including Microsoft are also investing in researching approaches to decentralization in machine learning. With the upliftment of big data technology, designing optimized artificial intelligence algorithms is a must need. At the base of every machine learning algorithm we need data. Data is something that can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound or picture that is not being interpreted and analyzed. This data is not generated by just one party, multiple parties generate such data. The data will be geographically distributed amongst organizations. This pushes the need and research of distributed machine learning algorithms. In the current scenario, there is a central server which will run the machine learning algorithm and produce results, in this system obviously we need to collect all the data at that server itself. If the server is attacked then there is a problem of security of data. Also many organizations would not like to just lend their data to some third party. To address all such issues, we study all the possible ways for implementing a distributed machine learning system and propose a blockchain based distributed conservative system. Mainly, we design a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to learn a general predictive model over the trending blockchain technology, also taking care of Byzantine attack, using the within-N algorithm. Also analysis will be made on different machine learning algorithms and datasets as a part of testing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.",

In implementing a security policy, the browser only has access to HTTP requests and responses, and takes policy actions based solely on those interactions. In checking the browser security policies, CorbFuzz uses a policy oracle that tracks the web application behavior and infers the desired policy action based on the web application state. By comparing the policy oracle with the browser behavior, CorbFuzz detects weaknesses in browser security policies. CorbFuzz checks the web browser policy by fuzzing a set of web applications where the state-related queries are symbolically evaluated for increased coverage and automation. CorbFuzz collects type information from database queries and branch conditions in order to prevent the generation of inconsistent data values during fuzzing.

        "abstract": "Firmware refers to device read-only resident code which includes microcode and macro-instruction-level routines. For Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices without an operating system, firmware includes all the necessary instructions on how such embedded systems operate and communicate. Thus, firmware updates are essential parts of device functionality. They provide the ability to patch vulnerabilities, address operational issues, and improve device reliability and performance during the lifetime of the system. This process, however, is often exploited by attackers in order to inject malicious firmware code into the embedded device. In this article, we present a framework for secure firmware updates on embedded systems. This approach is based on hardware primitives and cryptographic modules, and it can be deployed in environments where communication channels might be insecure. The implementation of the framework is flexible, as it can be adapted in regards to the IoT device’s available hardware resources and constraints. Our security analysis shows that our framework is resilient to a variety of attack vectors. The experimental setup demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. By implementing a variety of test cases on FPGA, we demonstrate the adaptability and performance of the framework. Experiments indicate that the update procedure for a 1183-kB firmware image could be achieved, in a secure manner, under 1.73 seconds.",

        "abstract": "Due to its durability, the security of persistent memory (PM) needs to be ensured. Recent works have identified the requirements for correctly architecting secure PM to achieve crash recoverability. A key performance bottleneck, however, lies in the integrity tree update, which needs to be consistent with the memory persistency model and incurs a very high performance overhead. In this paper, we aim to drastically reduce this performance overhead.  First, we propose to leverage a small on-chip non-volatile metadata cache (nvMC) for keeping a small portion of the integrity tree. We show that nvMC cannot be managed like a regular cache due to violating crash recoverability, and hence derive a set of invariants to be satisfied for the nvMC to work properly. Then, we propose the idea of Bonsai Merkle Forests (BMF), which splits an integrity tree into multiple trees, leading to a forest, with the tree roots maintained in the nvMC. We propose and analyze different ways of BMF management. Our experimental results show that our proposed BMF schemes drastically reduce the performance overhead of BMT root updates, from 426% to just 3.5%.",

        "abstract": "As automotive security concerns are rising, the Controller Area Network (CAN) — the de facto standard of in-vehicle communication protocol — has come under scrutiny due to its lack of encryption and authentication. Several vulnerabilities, such as eavesdropping, spoofing, and replay attacks, have shown that the current implementation needs to be extended. Both academic and commercial solutions for a Secure CAN (S-CAN) have been proposed, but OEMs have not yet integrated them into their products. The main reasons for this lack of adoption are their heavy use of limited computational resources in the vehicle, increased latency that can lead to missed deadlines for safety-critical messages, as well as insufficient space available in a CAN frame to include a Message Authentication Code (MAC).  By making a trade-off between security and performance, we develop S2-CAN, which overcomes the aforementioned problems of S-CAN. We leverage protocol-specific properties of CAN instead of using cryptographic primitives and design a “sufficiently secure” alternative CAN with minimal overhead on resources and latency. We evaluate the security of S2-CAN in four real-world vehicles by an automated vehicular attack tool. We finally show that CAN security can be guaranteed by the correct choice of a design parameter while achieving acceptable performance.",

We postulate that unpredictability can improve network defences in two key capacities: (1) by re-configuring the network in direct response to detected threats, tailored to the current threat and a security posture, and (2) by deceiving adversaries using pseudo-random decision-making (selected from a set of acceptable set of responses), potentially leading to adversary delay and failure. Decisions are performed automatically, based on reported events (e.g., Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts), security posture, mission processes, and states of assets. Using this codified form of situational awareness, our system can respond differently to threats each time attacker activity is observed, acting as a barrier to further attacker activities. We demonstrate feasibility with both anomaly- and misuse-based detection alerts, for a historical dataset (playback), and a real-time network simulation where asset-to-mission mappings are known. Our findings suggest that unpredictability yields promise as a new approach to deception in laboratory settings. Further research will be necessary to explore unpredictability in production environments.",

A significant challenge is imposter tags that mimic legitimate tag behaviour, compromising the system data integrity. In this work, we argue that tag simplicity and operation on harvested energy can help identify imposter transmissions, thus safeguarding data integrity. Our experimental study reveals that commonly used low-power tag oscillators demonstrate unique fingerprint patterns when exposed to the dynamics of harvested energy. Based on this observation, we design and propose HarvestPrint, which leverages these fingerprints to differentiate authentic backscatter transmissions from imposter transmissions. Experiments with a tag powered through a small solar cell show the potential of HarvestPrint.",

Some of these schemes suffer from a faulty design that happened mainly owing to undue emphasis on privacy and anonymity alongside performance efficiency. This article aims to show the design faults by analyzing a very recent hash functions-based authentication scheme for cloud-based IoT systems with misunderstood privacy cum efficiency tradeoff owing to an unadorned design flaw, which is also present in many other such schemes. Precisely, it is proved in this article that the scheme of Wazid et al. cannot provide mutual authentication and key agreement between a user and a sensor node when there exists more than one registered user. We then proposed an improved scheme and proved its security through formal and informal methods. The proposed scheme completes the authentication cycle with a minor increase in computation cost but provides all security goals along with privacy.",

In the past, the text-based password was the traditional way of authentication, but this method has particular shortcomings. The graphical password has been introduced as an alternative, which uses a picture or a set of pictures to generate a password. In the future, it is a requirement of such approaches to maintain robustness and consume fewer energy resources to become suitable for the Green Internet of Things (IoT). Similarly, diverse graphical password authentication mechanisms have been used to provide users with better security and usability. In this article, we conduct an extensive survey on the existing approaches of graphical password authentication to highlight the challenges required to be addressed for Green IoT. In comparison to other existing surveys, the objective is to consolidate the graphical password technique and to identify the problem associated with it. Besides, this survey will also identify the vulnerabilities of the graphical password against several potential attacks. We have also examined the strengths and weaknesses of each technique along with the future research directions. This study also evaluates the usability of each approach by considering learnability, memorability, and so forth and also presents a comparative analysis with security.",

        "abstract": "Remote attestation (RA) authenticates code running in trusted execution environments (TEEs), allowing trusted code to be deployed even on untrusted hosts. However, trust relationships established by one component in a distributed application may impact the security of other components, making it difficult to reason about the security of the application as a whole. Furthermore, traditional RA approaches interact badly with modern web service design, which tends to employ small interacting microservices, short session lifetimes, and little or no state. This paper presents the Decent Application Platform, a framework for building secure decentralized applications. Decent applications authenticate and authorize distributed enclave components using a protocol based on self-attestation certificates, a reusable credential based on RA and verifiable by a third party. Components mutually authenticate each other not only based on their code, but also based on the other components they trust, ensuring that no transitively-connected components receive unauthorized information. While some other TEE frameworks support mutual authentication in some form, Decent is the only system that supports mutual authentication without requiring an additional trusted third party besides the trusted hardware's manufacturer. We have verified the secrecy and authenticity of Decent application data in ProVerif, and implemented two applications to evaluate Decent's expressiveness and performance: DecentRide, a ride-sharing service, and DecentHT, a distributed hash table. On the YCSB benchmark, we show that DecentHT achieves 7.5x higher throughput and 3.67x lower latency compared to a non-Decent implementation.",

Considering these problems, we propose a specialized method such that the patient’s rights and changes in medical treatment can be preserved. The problem arising due to Melanoma skin cancer is carefully considered and a privacy-preserving cloud-based approach is proposed to achieve effective skin lesion segmentation. The work is accomplished by the development of a Z-score-based local color correction method to differentiate image pixels from ambiguity, resulting the segmentation quality to be highly improved. On the other hand, the privacy is assured by partially order homomorphic Permutation Ordered Binary (POB) number system and image permutation. Experiments are performed over publicly available images from the ISIC 2016 and 2017 challenges, as well as PH\\(\\) dataset, where the proposed approach is found to achieve significant results over the encrypted images (known as encrypted domain), as compared to the existing schemes in the plain domain (unencrypted images). We also compare the results with the winners of the ISBI 2016 and 2017 challenges, and show that the proposed approach achieves a very close result with them, even after processing test images in the encrypted domain.

Volunteer computing is being used in high-energy physics, molecular biology, medicine, astrophysics, climate study, and other areas. These projects have attained unprecedented computing power. However, with the development of information technology, the traditional defense system cannot deal with the unknown security problems of volunteer computing. At the same time, Cyber Mimic Defense (CMD) can defend the unknown attack behavior through its three characteristics: dynamic, heterogeneous, and redundant. As an important part of the CMD, the dynamic scheduling algorithm realizes the dynamic change of the service centralized executor, which can enusre the security and reliability of CMD of volunteer computing. Aiming at the problems of passive scheduling and large scheduling granularity existing in the existing scheduling algorithms, this article first proposes a scheduling algorithm based on time threshold and task threshold and realizes the dynamic randomness of mimic defense from two different dimensions; finally, combining time threshold and random threshold, a dynamic scheduling algorithm based on multi-level queue is proposed. The experiment shows that the dynamic scheduling algorithm based on multi-level queue can take both security and reliability into account, has better dynamic heterogeneous redundancy characteristics, and can effectively prevent the transformation rule of heterogeneous executors from being mastered by attackers.",

        "abstract": "The right to be forgotten states that a data owner has the right to erase their data from an entity storing it. In the context of machine learning (ML), the right to be forgotten requires an ML model owner to remove the data owner's data from the training set used to build the ML model, a process known asmachine unlearning. While originally designed to protect the privacy of the data owner, we argue that machine unlearning may leave some imprint of the data in the ML model and thus create unintended privacy risks. In this paper, we perform the first study on investigating the unintended information leakage caused by machine unlearning. We propose a novel membership inference attack that leverages the different outputs of an ML model's two versions to infer whether a target sample is part of the training set of the original model but out of the training set of the corresponding unlearned model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed membership inference attack achieves strong performance. More importantly, we show that our attack in multiple cases outperforms the classical membership inference attack on the original ML model, which indicates that machine unlearning can have counterproductive effects on privacy. We notice that the privacy degradation is especially significant for well-generalized ML models where classical membership inference does not perform well. We further investigate four mechanisms to mitigate the newly discovered privacy risks and show that releasing the predicted label only, temperature scaling, and differential privacy are effective. We believe that our results can help improve privacy protection in practical implementations of machine unlearning. \\footnoteOur code is available at \\urlhttps://github.com/MinChen00/UnlearningLeaks.",

If a key other than the secret one is applied the synchronization and, thereby, the communication fails. SyncLock is implemented using a novel locking concept. A hard-coded error is hidden into the design while the unlocking, i.e., the error correction, takes place at another part of the design upon application of the secret key. SyncLock presents several advantages. It is generally applicable, incorrect keys result in denial-of-service, it incurs no performance penalty and minimum overheads, and it offers maximum security thwarting all known counter-attacks. We demonstrate SyncLock with hardware measurements.",

In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prices are going to decrease, this has contributed greatly to an increase in demand for them. However, many challenges face the widespread use of UAVs. One of the most important challenges is his vulnerability to hacking. This paper presents a semi-decentralized collaboration model for the secure measurement of drone positions. The proposed model is based on choosing a leader for each specified period of time by a lightweight consensus algorithm. The leader gets his position using satellites, other drone team members are based on the leader’s safe position to find their locations in a way that is immune to GPS spoofing. Our proposal study shows the extent of the security level it provides against spoofing attacks.",

        "abstract": "Cyberspace smart devices refer to the general term for devices that can connect to the Internet and have data processing functions. With the development of the Internet of Things technology, new smart devices such as webcams have brought convenience to people's lives, but also exposed many security vulnerabilities. Discovering smart devices in cyberspace is the prerequisite and basis for implementing cyberspace security management. However, the traditional pattern matching identification method requires manual extraction of device keywords, and keeping the keywords intact and updating the fingerprint database hinders accurate and large-scale device discovery. In this regard, this paper proposes a smart device identification method based on Web fingerprints and neural network. We use asynchronous stateless scanning and web crawlers to obtain the target's HTTP response data, extract the text in the response data based on natural language processing technology, and use neural networks to build a classification model. After processing, the response data of each IP is converted into concise text as a feature vector, and these texts are finally used to train the neural network model to realize the identification of smart devices. In order to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm, this paper uses Python to implement a prototype system and conduct experimental verification to evaluate its performance. Experiments show that among the four neural network models used, the RCNN model can converge in the shortest time and reach a training accuracy of 98.66%, and an accuracy of 90.59% on the test set. It is verified that the algorithm proposed in this paper is feasible and has a good ability to recognize smart devices.",

This is called the password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol. PAKE protocol has been considered a suitable substitute for the prevailing hash-based authentication which is vulnerable to various attacks. However, vendors are discouraged by both its prohibitively computational overheads as well as integrating costs, leading to its limited use since being proposed.  After carefully analyzing the general workflow of PAKE protocols, we present Heterogeneous-PAKE, an entire PAKE stack with high-performance and compatibility for both client-side and server-side for Web systems. Using SRP and SPAKE2+ as case studies, we conduct a series of comprehensive experiments, especially comparing with the conventional hash-based solutions to evaluate the Heterogeneous-PAKE. The implementation harvests high throughput on the server-side with over 240k, 70k, 30k, and 1,650k operations per second for SRP-1024, SRP-1536, SRP-2048, and SPAKE2+ respectively. Meanwhile, on most testing platforms, the latency is well controlled within user-acceptable bounds, especially the SPAKE2+ whose delay is less than 3x that of a traditional authentication approach based on Bcrypt. The empirical results demonstrate that the Heterogeneous-PAKE is a very economical (with only a GPU-ready server) and convenient (with an easy-to-integrate software stack without user participation or database rebuilding) solution for upgrading existing systems with high-performance PAKE services.",

Despite its popularity in different domains, little is known about WebAssembly binaries that occur in the wild. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 8,461 unique WebAssembly binaries gathered from a wide range of sources, including source code repositories, package managers, and live websites. We study the security properties, source languages, and use cases of the binaries and how they influence the security of the WebAssembly ecosystem. Our findings update some previously held assumptions about real-world WebAssembly and highlight problems that call for future research. For example, we show that vulnerabilities that propagate from insecure source languages potentially affect a wide range of binaries (e.g., two thirds of the binaries are compiled from memory unsafe languages, such as C and C++) and that 21% of all binaries import potentially dangerous APIs from their host environment. We also show that cryptomining, which once accounted for the majority of all WebAssembly code, has been marginalized (less than 1% of all binaries found on the web) and gives way to a diverse set of use cases. Finally, 29% of all binaries on the web are minified, calling for techniques to decompile and reverse engineer WebAssembly. Overall, our results show that WebAssembly has left its infancy and is growing up into a language that powers a diverse ecosystem, with new challenges and opportunities for security researchers and practitioners. Besides these insights, we also share the dataset underlying our study, which is 58 times larger than the largest previously reported benchmark.",

The Internet of Things (IoT), offering universal and ubiquitous connectivity to both people and objects, revealed to be the silver bullet for enabling a vast number of previously unexpected applications. In particular, media streaming providers are growing in business and scope, and we can forecast that soon, video streaming will substitute TV broadcasting activities. With the increasing success of multi-user smart environments, empowered by new-generation smart devices and IoT architectures, multimedia contents (i.e., images and videos) need to be effectively accessed anytime and anywhere. Recent advances in computer vision technologies have made the development of intelligent monitoring systems for video surveillance and ambient-assisted living. Such a scenario permits better integration among technologies, multimedia content, and end-users. However, there are several challenges, and some are still open. More precisely, due to the sensitivity of some multimedia content (e.g., video-surveillance streams), it is paramount to preserve users’ privacy. Again, it is necessary to guarantee the integrity of usage rights during any multimedia transmission process, starting from the video encoding phase. In this way, the private content is disclosed only when the stream is decoded on the other endpoint, by the legitimate user.In this article, we present a secure video transmission strategy that can address the challenges mentioned above. The proposed strategy takes advantage of both watermarking and video scrambling techniques to make it possible for the secure and privacy-preserving transmission of multimedia streaming. Through our proposal, multimedia streaming is of low quality and thus unusable. However, it can be fully recovered and enjoyed only by authorized users. Finally, due to its low complexity and energy-efficiency, our proposal is particularly suitable for onboard implementations.",

In this article, we present a novel approach to identifying the Most Likely Mission-critical Component Set (MLMCS) using AND/OR dependency graphs enriched with independent failure probabilities. We address the MLMCS problem as a Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. We translate probabilities into a negative logarithmic space to linearise the problem within MaxSAT.

Our tool visualises propagation of risks from sensor alert data to Business Process (BP) tasks. This is an important capability gap present in many SOCs today, as most threat detection tools are technology-centric. In this article, we present a user study that assesses our tool’s usability and ability to support the analyst. Ten analysts from seven SOCs performed carefully designed tasks related to understanding risks and recovery decision-making. The study was conducted in laboratory conditions with simulated attacks and used a mixed-method approach to collect data from questionnaires, eye tracking, and semi-structured interviews. Our findings suggest that relating business tasks to network asset in visualisations can help analysts prioritise response strategies.

Meanwhile, DNN models have been shown to be vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. One such attack that has attracted a great deal of attention recently is the backdoor attack. Specifically, the adversary poisons the target model’s training set to mislead any input with an added secret trigger to a target class.  Previous backdoor attacks predominantly focus on computer vision (CV) applications, such as image classification. In this paper, we perform a systematic investigation of backdoor attack on NLP models, and propose BadNL, a general NLP backdoor attack framework including novel attack methods. Specifically, we propose three methods to construct triggers, namely BadChar, BadWord, and BadSentence, including basic and semantic-preserving variants. Our attacks achieve an almost perfect attack success rate with a negligible effect on the original model’s utility. For instance, using the BadChar, our backdoor attack achieves a 98.9% attack success rate with yielding a utility improvement of 1.5% on the SST-5 dataset when only poisoning 3% of the original set. Moreover, we conduct a user study to prove that our triggers can well preserve the semantics from humans perspective.",

(CCS'17, CCS'18)). In this paper we demonstrate multiple algorithmic improvements upon these works. In particular, our protocol has an asymptotically better computation cost, requiring only O(√|X| ) homomorphic multiplications, and communication complexity sublinear in the larger set size|X|. We demonstrate that our protocol is significantly better than that of Chen et al. (CCS'18) for many practical parameters, especially in terms of online communication cost. For example, when intersecting $228 and 2048 item sets, our protocol reduces the online computation time by more than 71% and communication by more than 63%. When intersecting 224 and 4096 item sets, our protocol reduces the online computation time by 27% and communication by 63%. Our comparison to other state-of-the-art unbalanced PSI protocols shows that our protocol has the best total communication complexity when |X| ≥ 224. For labeled PSI our protocol also outperforms Chen et al. (CCS'18). When intersecting 220 and 256 item sets, with the larger set having associated 288-byte labels, our protocol reduces the online computation time by more than 67% and communication by 34%. Finally, we demonstrate a modification that results in nearly constant communication cost in the larger set size |X|, but impractically high computation complexity on today's CPUs. For example, to intersect a 210-item set with sets of size 222, 224, or 226, our proof-of-concept implementation requires only 0.76 MB of online communication, which is more than a 24-fold improvement over Chen et al.

In 2019, Tyagi et al. developed message traceback, which addresses this issue by allowing a messaging platform to recover the path of a forwarded message after a user reports it for malicious content. This paper presents an alternative to message traceback that offers more privacy to users and requires less platform-side storage. We term this approach source-tracking for encrypted messaging schemes. Source-tracking enables messaging platforms to provide the privacy guarantees expected from standard end-to-end encryption, but also helps hold the sources of malicious messages accountable: if malicious content is reported by a user, the source can be identified. We formalize security goals for source-tracking schemes and design and implement two source-tracking schemes with different security and performance tradeoffs.",

Meanwhile, security is seen as one of the most critical issues of low-power IoT devices even with pre-quantum public key cryptography since IoT devices have strict energy constraints and limited computational power. Thus, state-of-the-art dedicated hardware accelerators have been deployed to facilitate secure and confidential communication with well established protocols on such devices. It is common belief that the complexity of the cryptographic computations are also the bottleneck of the new, quantum-resistant algorithms and that hardware accelerators are necessary to use them efficiently on energy constrained embedded devices. In this paper, we carried out an in-depth investigation of the application of potential Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms, which were proposed in the associated US NIST process, to a representative TLS-based low-power IoT infrastructure. First, we show that the main contributor to the TLS handshake latency are the higher bandwidth requirements of post-quantum Key-Encapsulation Mechanisms rather than the cryptographic computations itself. Second, from the perspective of crypto-agility we show that edge devices with code-based, isogeny-based as well as lattice-based algorithms have low energy consumption, which enables long battery run times in typical IoT scenarios without dedicated hardware accelerators. Third, we increase the level of security further by combining pre-quantum and post-quantum algorithms to a hybrid key exchange, and quantify the overhead in energy consumption and latency of it.",

These IoT-based systems contribute to both daily life and business, including sensitive and emergency situations. In general, the devices or sensors used in the IoT have very limited computational power, storage capacity, and communication capabilities, but they help to collect a large amount of data as well as maintain communication with the other devices in the network. Since most of the IoT devices have no physical security, and often are open to everyone via radio communication and via the internet, they are highly vulnerable to existing and emerging novel security attacks. Further, the IoT devices are usually integrated with the corporate networks; in this case, the impact of attacks will be much more significant than operating in isolation. Due to the constraints of the IoT devices, and the nature of their operation, existing security mechanisms are less effective for countering the attacks that are specific to the IoT-based systems. This article presents a new insider attack, named loophole attack, that exploits the vulnerabilities present in a widely used IPv6 routing protocol in IoT-based systems, called RPL (Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks). To protect the IoT system from this insider attack, a machine learning based security mechanism is presented. The proposed attack has been implemented using a Contiki IoT operating system that runs on the Cooja simulator, and the impacts of the attack are analyzed. Evaluation on the collected network traffic data demonstrates that the machine learning based approaches, along with the proposed features, help to accurately detect the insider attack from the network traffic data.",

Despite extensive research efforts, secure allocators can only be evaluated by with theoretical analysis or pre-defined data sets, which are insufficient to effectively reflect powerful adversaries in the real world. In this paper, we present HardsHeap, an automatic tool for evaluating secure allocators. The key idea of HardsHeap is to use random testing (i.e., fuzzing) to evaluate secure allocators. To handle the diverse properties of secure allocators, HardsHeap supports an extensible framework, making it easy to write a validation logic for each property. Moreover, HardsHeap employs sampling-based testing, which enables us to evaluate a probabilistic mechanism prevalent in secure allocators. To eliminate redundancy in findings from HardsHeap, we devise a new technique called Statistical Significance Delta Debugging (SSDD), which extends the existing delta debugging for stochastically reproducible test cases. We evaluated HardsHeap to 10 secure allocators. Consequently, we found 56 interesting test cases, including several unsecure yet underestimated behaviors for handling large objects in secure allocators. Moreover, we discovered 10 implementation bugs. One of the bugs is integer overflow in secure allocators, making them even more invulnerable than ordinary allocators. Our evaluation also shows that SSDD successfully reduces test cases by 37.2% on average without a loss of reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "Cybersecurity suffers from an oversaturation of centralized, hierarchical systems and a lack of exploration in the area of horizontal security, or security techniques and technologies which utilize democratic participation for security decision-making. Because of this, many horizontally governed organizations such as activist groups, worker cooperatives, trade unions, not-for-profit associations, and others are not represented in current cybersecurity solutions, and are forced to adopt hierarchical solutions to cybersecurity problems. This causes power dynamic mismatches that lead to cybersecurity and organizational operations failures. In this work we introduce COLBAC, a collective based access control system aimed at addressing this lack. COLBAC uses democratically authorized capability tokens to express access control policies. It allows for a flexible and dynamic degree of horizontality to meet the needs of different horizontally governed organizations. After introducing COLBAC, we finish with a discussion on future work needed to realize more horizontal security techniques, tools, and technologies.",

        "abstract": "Edge Computing is a new computing paradigm where applications operate at the network edge, providing low-latency services with augmented user and data privacy. A desirable goal for edge computing is pervasiveness, that is, enabling any capable and authorized entity at the edge to provide desired edge services--pervasive edge computing (PEC). However, efficient access control of users receiving services and edge servers handling user data, without sacrificing performance is a challenge. Current solutions, based on \"always-on\" authentication servers in the cloud, negate the latency benefits of services at the edge and also do not preserve user and data privacy. In this paper, we present APECS, an advanced access control framework for PEC, which allows legitimate users to utilize any available edge services without need for communication beyond the network edge. The APECS framework leverages multi-authority attribute-based encryption to create a federated authority, which delegates the authentication and authorization tasks to semi-trusted edge servers, thus eliminating the need for an \"always-on\" authentication server in the cloud. Additionally, APECS prevents access to encrypted content by unauthorized edge servers. We analyze and prove the security of APECS in the Universal Composability framework and provide experimental results on the GENI testbed to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of APECS.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, voice-based Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications are gradually being replaced with data link-based equivalents, namely the Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) system. This helps to manage the high levels of congestion on voice-based ATC---under modern traffic levels these analog voice channels are extremely busy, especially at times of peak traffic. CPDLC offers the ability to conduct most ATC actions in the form of digital text-based messages. As with voice-based ATC, CPDLC has no built-in security mechanisms. Furthermore, the links which carry CPDLC do not have security mechanisms either. In this paper, we analyze the susceptibility of CPDLC to attacks by a software-defined radio (SDR)-equipped attacker. Crucially, this is different to attacks on aviation surveillance systems, as it requires the attacker to comply with a larger authentication protocol. We identify attacks on CPDLC, including a man-in-the-middle attack on the protocol. This attack enables a take-over of an aircraft's communication on an attacker-specified frequency, after which arbitrary CPDLC commands can be transmitted to the target without alerting the legitimate controller. We empirically assess the likely effectiveness of this attack through a data collection and analysis exercise. In order to counteract this type of attack, we propose three countermeasures of different complexities, including logical checks and a public key infrastructure approach. We also estimate to what extent these countermeasures can be implemented without altering the underlying protocol.",

Our framework incorporates several important engineering decisions such as full communication serialization, which enables MPC over arbitrary messaging interfaces and removes the need of owning network sockets. MOTION also incorporates several performance optimizations that improve the communication complexity and latency, e.g., \\( 2\\times \\) better online round complexity of precomputed correlated Oblivious Transfer (OT).We instantiate our framework with protocols for N parties and security against up to \\( N-1 \\) passive corruptions: the MPC protocols of Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) in its arithmetic and Boolean version and OT-based BMR (Ben-Efraim et al., CCS’16), as well as novel and highly efficient conversions between them, including a non-interactive conversion from BMR to arithmetic GMW.MOTION is highly efficient, which we demonstrate in our experiments. Compared to secure evaluation of AES-128 with \\( N=3 \\) parties in a high-latency network with OT-based BMR, we achieve a 16\\( \\times \\) better throughput of 16 AES evaluations per second using BMR.

Of particular interest among them is forward security, which makes past messages remain secure in the event that the secret key gets exposed. Traditional forward-secure public key encryption can provide forward security for asynchronous scenarios, but it is not flexible enough for instant messaging systems. This is mainly because that, after updating his/her secret key, the user totally loses the decryption capacity of ciphertexts that have not been received. In this paper, to achieve practical forward-security of asynchronous messaging systems, we investigate the construction of a new primitive named forward-secure puncturable encryption (FSPE) that captures fine-grained forward security. Namely, the user can maintain the decryption capacity of those encrypted messages that have not been received yet. Meanwhile, even if the secret key is disclosed, those received messages can still remain secure. Specifically, we propose a communication-efficient FSPE scheme for achieving fine-grained forward-secure asynchronous messaging. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of asynchronous messaging built upon FSPE, we extend it to support outsourced decryption. We also implement the proposed scheme and evaluate a proof-of-concept of main algorithms, so as to increase confidence on its correctness and practicability.",

This mechanism---and similar mechanisms in other next-generation architectures---requires a distributed system to translate between old (IP) and new (SCION) addresses at an Internet scale and must connect the different public-key infrastructures to enable secure operation. In this paper, we describe such a system for the SCION architecture. A gossip protocol distributes mappings between legacy IP and SCION addresses throughout the SCION network, and SCION's control-plane PKI and the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) protect the authenticity of the individual mappings.

Perception modules in AVs combine multiple sensors to perceive the surrounding environment. As such, they have been the focus of efforts to exploit the aforementioned risks due to their critical role in controlling autonomous driving technology. Despite extensive and thorough research into the vulnerability of camera-based sensors, vulnerabilities originating from Lidar sensors and their corresponding deep learning models in AVs remain comparatively untouched. Being aware that small roadside objects can be occasionally incorrectly identified as vehicles through on-board deep learning models, we propose a novel adversarial attack inspired by this phenomenon in both white-box and black-box scenarios. The adversarial attacks proposed in this paper are launched against deep learning models that perform object detection tasks through raw 3D points collected by a Lidar sensor in an autonomous driving scenario. In comparison to existing works, our attack creates not only adversarial point clouds in simulated environments, but also robust adversarial objects that can cause behavioral reactions in state of the art autonomous driving systems. Defense methods are then proposed and evaluated against this type of adversarial objects.",

In system-on-chips (SoCs), Hardware Trojans (HTs) manipulate the functionalities of the routing components to saturate the on-chip network, degrade performance, and result in the leakage of sensitive data. Existing HT detection techniques, including runtime monitoring and state-of-the-art learning-based methods, are unable to timely and accurately identify the implanted HTs, due to the increasingly dynamic and complex nature of on-chip communication behaviors. We propose AGAPE, a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based anomaly detection and mitigation method against HTs for secured on-chip communication. AGAPE learns the distribution of the multivariate time series of a number of NoC attributes captured by on-chip sensors under both HT-free and HT-infected working conditions. The proposed GAN can learn the potential latent interactions among different runtime attributes concurrently, accurately distinguish abnormal attacked situations from normal SoC behaviors, and identify the type and location of the implanted HTs. Using the detection results, we apply the most suitable protection techniques to each type of detected HTs instead of simply isolating the entire HT-infected router, with the aim to mitigate security threats as well as reducing performance loss. Simulation results show that AGAPE enhances the HT detection accuracy by 19%, reduces network latency and power consumption by 39% and 30%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art security designs.",

Independent of their usage, be it within an IoT system or a CPS, embedded devices are always an attractive target for security attacks, mainly due to their continuous network availability and the importance of the data they handle. Thus, the design of such systems requires a thorough consideration of the various security constraints they are liable to. Introducing these security constraints, next to other requirements, such as power consumption, and performance increases the number of design choices a system designer must consider. As the various constraints are often conflicting with each other, designers face the complex task of balancing them. System designers facilitate Design Space Exploration (DSE) tools to support a system designer in this job. However, available DSE tools only offer a limited way of considering security constraints during the design process. In this article, we introduce a novel DSE framework, which allows the consideration of security constraints, in the form of attack scenarios, and attack mitigations in the form of security tasks. Based on the descriptions of the system’s functionality and architecture, possible attacks, and known mitigation techniques, the framework finds the optimal design for a secure IoT device or CPS. Our framework’s functionality and its benefits are shown based on the design of a secure sensor system.",

        "abstract": "Ethereum holds multiple billions of U.S. dollars in the form of Ether cryptocurrency and ERC-20 tokens, with millions of deployed smart contracts algorithmically operating these funds. Unsurprisingly, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has been under rigorous scrutiny. In recent years, numerous defense tools have been developed to detect different types of smart contract code vulnerabilities. When opportunities for exploiting code vulnerabilities diminish, the attackers start resorting to social engineering attacks, which aim to influence humans - often the weakest link in the system. The only known class of social engineering attacks in Ethereum are honeypots, which plant hidden traps for attackers attempting to exploit existing vulnerabilities, thereby targeting only a small population of potential victims. In this work, we explore the possibility and existence of new social engineering attacks beyond smart contract honeypots. We present two novel classes of Ethereum social engineering attacks - Address Manipulation and Homograph - and develop six zero-day social engineering attacks. To show how the attacks can be used in popular programming patterns, we conduct a case study of five popular smart contracts with combined market capitalization exceeding $29 billion, and integrate our attack patterns in their source codes without altering their existing functionality. Moreover, we show that these attacks remain dormant during the test phase but activate their malicious logic only at the final production deployment. We further analyze 85,656 open-source smart contracts, and discover that 1,027 of them can be used for the proposed social engineering attacks. We conduct a professional opinion survey with experts from seven smart contract auditing firms, corroborating that the exposed social engineering attacks bring a major threat to the smart contract systems.",

The framework provides adequate security support through identity management, crypto operations, policy database, deception technology, web and email security, API security and ATP technology. This framework enhances security by ensuring that organizations are aware of current security incidents.",

        "abstract": "Modern distributed systems involve interactions between principals with limited trust, so cryptographic mechanisms are needed to protect confidentiality and integrity. At the same time, most developers lack the training to securely employ cryptography. We present Viaduct, a compiler that transforms high-level programs into secure, efficient distributed realizations. Viaduct's source language allows developers to declaratively specify security policies by annotating their programs with information flow labels. The compiler uses these labels to synthesize distributed programs that use cryptography efficiently while still defending the source-level security policy. The Viaduct approach is general, and can be easily extended with new security mechanisms.   Our implementation of the Viaduct compiler comes with an extensible runtime system that includes plug-in support for multiparty computation, commitments, and zero-knowledge proofs. We have evaluated the system on a set of benchmarks, and the results indicate that our approach is feasible and can use cryptography in efficient, nontrivial ways.",

While it has been known that the DSMX protocol is vulnerable to attacks, the security of the other protocols was an open question.

Thus, it is important for remote administrators to maintain control of these devices via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions. ARM TrustZone has been widely regarded as the de facto solution for protecting the security-sensitive software, such as MDM agents, from attacks of a compromised rich OS. However, little attention has been given to protecting the MDM control channel, a fundamental component for a remote administrator to invoke the TrustZone-based MDM agents and perform specific management operations. In this work, we design an ARM TrustZone-based network mechanism, called TZNIC, towards enabling resilient and secure access to TrustZone-based software, even in the presence of a malicious rich OS. TZNIC deploys two NIC drivers, one secure-world driver and one normal-world driver, multiplexing one physical NIC. We utilize the ARM TrustZone-based high privilege to protect the secure-world driver and further resolve several challenges on sharing one set of hardware peripherals between two isolated software environments. TZNIC does not require any changes or collaboration of the rich OS. We implement a prototype of TZNIC, and the evaluation results show that TZNIC can provide a reliable network channel to invoke the security software in the secure world, with minimal system overhead on the rich OS.",

The resource limitations of the sensor nodes make the conventional security systems less attractive for WSN. Moreover, conventional cryptography alone cannot ensure the desired security against the physical attacks on sensor nodes. Physically unclonable function (PUF) is an emerging hardware security primitive that provides low-cost hardware security exploiting the unique inherent randomness of a device. In this article, we have proposed an authentication and key sharing scheme for the WSN integrating Pedersen’s verifiable secret sharing (Pedersen’s VSS) and Shamir’s secret sharing (Shamir’s SS) scheme with PUF which ensure the desired security with low overhead. The security analysis depicts the resilience of the proposed scheme against different active, passive and physical attacks. Also, the performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme possesses low computation, communication and storage overhead. The scheme only needs to store a polynomial number of PUF challenge-response pairs to the user node. The sink or senor nodes do not require storing any secret key. Finally, the comparison with the previous protocols establishes the dominance of the proposed scheme to use in WSN.",

In this paper, we aim to build large-scale secure XGB under vertically federated learning setting. We guarantee data privacy from three aspects. Specifically, (1) we employ secure multi-party computation techniques to avoid leaking intermediate information during training, (2) we store the output model in a distributed manner in order to minimize information release, and (3) we provide a novel algorithm for secure XGB predict with the distributed model. Furthermore, by proposing secure permutation protocols, we can improve the training efficiency and make the framework scale to large dataset.

SS based methods have provable security, but they have efficiency issue under high-dimensional sparse features.

Although 5G cellular protocols have been enhanced to prevent some of these attacks, the root vulnerability for fake base-stations still exists. In this paper, we propose an efficient broadcast authentication protocol based on a hierarchical identity-based signature scheme, Schnorr-HIBS, which addresses the root cause of the fake base-station problem with minimal computation and communication overhead. We implement and evaluate our proposed protocol using off-the-shelf software-defined radios and open-source libraries.

We have designed and implemented DecFL, an ubiquitous protocol for decentralized model training.

The implemented DecFL framework presented in this article is an exemplary realization of the carefully designed protocol stack based on Ethereum and IPFS and offers a scalable baseline solution for decentralized machine learning. In this article, we present a study based on the proposed protocol, its theoretical bounds and experiments based on the implemented framework. Using open-source datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10), we demonstrate key features, the actual cost of training a model (in euro) and the communication overhead. We further show that through a proper choice of technologies DecFL achieves a linear scaling, which is a non-trivial task in a decentralized setting. Along with discussing some of the security challenges in the field, we highlight aggregation poisoning as a relevant attack vector, its associated risks and a possible prevention strategy for decentralized model training through DecFL.",

        "abstract": "Website fingerprinting attacks on Tor pose an security issue in anonymity privacy, in which attackers can identify websites visited by victims through passively capturing and analyzing encrypted packet traces. Although related works have been studied over a long period, most of them focus on single-tab packet traces which only contain one page tab’s data. However, users often open multiple page tabs successively when browsing the web, and multi-tab packet traces generated will corrupt common single-tab attacks. Existing multi-tab attacks still depend on an elaborate feature engineering, besides, they fail to exploit the overlapping area which contains the mixed data of two adjacent page tabs, thus suffering from the information lost or confusion. In this paper, we propose a Block Attention Profiling Model named BAPM as a new multi-tab attacking model. Specifically, BAPM fully utilizes the whole multi-tab packet trace including the overlapping area to avoid information lost. It generates a tab-aware representation from direction sequences and performs the block division to separate mixed page tabs as clearly as possible, thus relieving the information confusion. Then the attention-based profiling is used to group blocks belonging to the same page tab and finally multiple websites are simultaneously identified under a global view. We compare BAPM with state of the art multi-tab attacks, and BAPM outperforms comparison methods even with larger overlapping area. The effectiveness of model design is also validated through ablation, sensitivity and generalization analysis.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to flexible deployment and excellent maneuverability, autonomous drones have been recently considered as an effective means to act as aerial data relays for wireless ground devices with limited or no cellular infrastructure, e.g., smart farming in a remote area. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, data communications between the drones and the ground devices are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This article develops BloothAir, which is a secure multi-hop aerial relay system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connected autonomous drones. For encrypting the BLE communications in BloothAir, a channel-based secret key generation is proposed, where received signal strength at the drones and the ground devices is quantized to generate the secret keys. Moreover, a dynamic programming-based channel quantization scheme is studied to minimize the secret key bit mismatch rate of the drones and the ground devices by recursively adjusting the quantization intervals. To validate the design of BloothAir, we build a multi-hop aerial relay testbed by using the MX400 drone platform and the Gust radio transceiver, which is a new lightweight onboard BLE communicator specially developed for the drone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that the BloothAir system achieves a significantly lower secret key bit mismatch rate than the key generation benchmarks, which use the static quantization intervals. In addition, the high randomness of the generated secret keys is verified by the standard NIST test, thereby effectively protecting the BLE communications in BloothAir from the eavesdropping attacks.",

Security management processes typically use the Deming Cycle or an adaption for continuous improvements of products, services, or processes within the network infrastructure. We adjust a security management process with visualization for IAM, which also shifts the focus from typical assets to the attacker. With the controlled cycles, the maturity of IAM is measured and can continually advance.

Incidents in the past, highlighted the magnitude of impacts arising from attacks, such as disruptions of power supply or in manufacturing plants. In order to adequately react on incidents and analyze deliberate attacks on IACS, it is indispensable to have appropriate forensics capabilities in this area. Based on an analysis of existing approaches and recent research results, this paper provides an overview of significant challenges that need to be overcome as prerequisites for building effective and efficient forensic capabilities for IACS. The classification and typology of Digital Forensic Readiness (DFR) in IACS requirements presented in this paper, pave the way to better integrate forensic capabilities into future IACS systems. As smart manufacturing is now a focus of designing and implementing the next generation of IACS systems, a unique opportunity arises for introducing forensic capabilities at the system design level without having to re-engineer whole infrastructures. At the same time the much higher dependence on IT infrastructures and the resulting temptation for criminals are creating an environment in which such forensic capabilities become indispensable. This paper can therefore be considered as an initial step, laying the foundations for the development of a generic forensic analysis model in smart manufacturing environments.",

The smart grid is an attempt to enhance and rejuvenate the secondary sector (the traditional power sector). In the contemporary context, the goal of constructing smart grids is to create a fair and healthy competitive energy market environment. Simultaneously, doing so can help to safeguard the environment and achieve carbon neutrality. With the advent of blockchain, new ideas for smart grid solutions have been developed and implemented. From the standpoint of blockchain types, this article details the aims and contributions made by state of the art technologies, particularly in the field of security. Further, we summarize the shortcomings of existing technologies and the relatively understudied security topics.

Meanwhile, security issues found in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have attracted the attention of researchers from different disciplines in recent years. Since traditional rule-based algorithms are ineffective in detecting the misbehavior in VANETs, developing an effective algorithm to deal with this problem has become a promising research topic today. As such, an integrated algorithm for misbehavior detection systems (MDS) is presented in this paper. It is composed of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to reconstruct the location information as well as a support vector machine (SVM) as a binary classification method to check whether a vehicle is compromised or not. The vehicular reference misbehavior (VeReMi) extension dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and all the other detection algorithms compared in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of detecting 95.37% of the compromised vehicles. In terms of the F1 score, the proposed algorithm can provide better results than all the other detection algorithms compared in this study.",

The data processing is increasingly relying on algorithms that utilize machine learning to cope with the heterogeneity, scale, and velocity of the data. At the same time, there is an abundance of low-cost computation resources that can be used for edge-cloud collaborative computing viz., \"volunteer edge-cloud (VEC) computing\". However, lack of trust in terms of performance, agility, cost, and security (PACS) factors in edge resources is proving to be a barrier for wider adoption of VEC. In this paper, we propose a novel \"VECTrust\" model for support of trusted resource allocation algorithms in VEC computing environments for scientific data-intensive workflows. Our VECTrust features a two-stage probabilistic model that defines trust of VEC computing cluster resources by considering trustworthiness in metrics relevant to PACS factors. We evaluate our VECTrust model's ability to provide dynamic resource allocation based on PACS factors, while also enhancing edge-cloud trust in a VEC computing testbed. Further, we show that VECTrust is able to create a uniform and robust probability distribution of salient PACS factor related metrics within diverse bioinformatics workflows execution over batches of workflows.",

Online algorithms compute online functionalities that allow parties to join and leave over time, to provide multiple inputs and to obtain multiple outputs. In particular, the set of parties participating changes over time, i. e., at different points in time different sets of parties evaluate a function over their private inputs. To this end, we propose the notion of an online trusted third party that allows to prove the security of SMPC protocols implementing online functionalities or online algorithms, respectively. We show that any online functionality can be implemented perfectly secure in the presence of a semi-honest adversary, if strictly less than 1/2 of the parties participating are corrupted. We show that the same result holds in the presence of a malicious adversary if it corrupts strictly less than 1/3 of the parties and always allows the corrupted parties to arrive.",

Software-based real-time AVs intercept system and function calls to execute AV’s inspection routines, resulting in significant performance penalties as the monitoring code runs among the suspicious code. Simultaneously, dark silicon problems push the industry to add more specialized accelerators inside the processor to mitigate these integration problems. In this article, we propose Terminator, an AV-specific coprocessor to assist software AVs by outsourcing their matching procedures to the hardware, thus saving CPU cycles and mitigating performance degradation. We designed Terminator   to be flexible and compatible with existing AVs by using YARA and ClamAVrules. Our experiments show that our approach can save up to 70 million CPU cycles per rule when outsourcing on-demand checks for matching typical, unmodified YARA rules against a dataset of 30 thousand in-the-wild malware samples. Our proposal eliminates the AV’s need for blocking the CPU to perform full system checks, which can now occur in parallel. We also designed a new inspection breakpoint mechanism that signals to the coprocessor the beginning of a monitored region, allowing it to scan the regions in parallel with their execution. Overall, our mechanism mitigated up to 44% of the overhead imposed to execute and monitor the SPEC benchmark applications in the most challenging scenario.",

As a part of smart ecosystems, Enterprise Internet of Things (E-IoT) allows users to integrate and control more complex installations in comparison to off-the-shelf IoT systems. With E-IoT, users have a complete control of audio, video, scheduled events, lightning fixtures, shades, door access, and relays via available user interfaces. As such, these systems see widespread use in government or smart private offices, schools, smart buildings, professional conference rooms, hotels, smart homes, yachts, and similar professional settings. However, even with their widespread use, the security of many E-IoT systems has not been researched in the literature. Further, many E-IoT systems utilize proprietary communication protocols that rely mostly on security through obscurity, which has perhaps led many users to mistakenly assume that these systems are secure. To address this open research problem and determine if E-IoT systems are vulnerable, we focus on one of the core E-IoT components, E-IoT communication buses. Communication buses are used by E-IoT proprietary protocols to connect multiple E-IoT devices (e.g., keypads and touchscreens) and trigger pre-configured events upon user actions. In this study, we introduce LightningStrike, the implementation of four proof-of-concept attacks that demonstrate several weaknesses in E-IoT proprietary communication protocols through communication buses. With LightningStrike, we show that it is feasible for an attacker to compromise E-IoT systems using E-IoT communication buses. We demonstrate that popular E-IoT proprietary communication protocols are susceptible to Denial-of-Service, eavesdropping, impersonation, and replay attacks. As E-IoT systems control physical access, safety components, and emergency equipment, an attacker with a low level of knowledge and effort can easily exploit E-IoT vulnerabilities to impact the security and safety of users, smart systems, and smart buildings worldwide.",

The framework offers dynamic, smart contracts between the sensor and the device user without the intervention of a trustworthy third party to exchange the captured IoT data. It uses an efficient proxy re-encryption system, which provides the owner and the person existing in the smart contract to see the data.

The hospital healthcare system is a common platform for people to access the health related services, anytime and anywhere. This service is completely driven by the regulations and policies of government and hospital administration. At present most hospital systems in India lack a secure mechanism for maintaining and managing patient health records. This is a crucial capability which a hospital healthcare system must have. Failure to have a robust system will cause multiple issues like inaccessibility when required, wrongfully sharing patient health record or allowing unethical players to access the health records. This will ultimately lead to lack of trust in the system Most of the current hospital healthcare systems store information centrally and provide access to the connected nodes as required. This architecture leads to single point of failure when central server is down or crashes or gets hacked. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a Chaincode-based framework to secure patient health information in hospital environment. Chaincode is a smart contract program which gets executed on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network automatically. A Chaincode stores the information in decentralized digital ledger and creates a secured and private blockchain network with trusted nodes and provide data visibility, data security, and data transparency with respect to patient health record at any time. This technology could solve the above said problem in more efficient way and provide better visibility and transparency to patient health data with more security.",

Due to their relative novelty, complexity, and opacity, these technologies provoke a variety of novel questions for design and governance. We interviewed researchers, developers, industry leaders, policymakers, and designers involved in their deployment to explore motivations, expectations, perceived opportunities and barriers to adoption. This provided insight into several pertinent challenges facing the adoption of these technologies, including: how they might make a nebulous concept like privacy computationally tractable; how to make them more usable by developers; and how they could be explained and made accountable to stakeholders and wider society. We conclude with implications for the development, deployment, and responsible governance of these privacy-preserving computation techniques.",

        "abstract": "Memory vulnerabilities are a major threat to many computing systems. To effectively thwart spatial and temporal memory vulnerabilities, full logical memory safety is required. However, current mitigation techniques for memory safety are either too expensive or trade security against efficiency. One promising attempt to detect memory safety vulnerabilities in hardware is memory coloring, a security policy deployed on top of tagged memory architectures. However, due to the memory storage and bandwidth overhead of large tags, commodity tagged memory architectures usually only provide small tag sizes, thus limiting their use for security applications. Irrespective of logical memory safety, physical memory safety is a necessity in hostile environments prevalent for modern cloud computing and IoT devices. Architectures from Intel and AMD already implement transparent memory encryption to maintain confidentiality and integrity of all off-chip data. Surprisingly, the combination of both, logical and physical memory safety, has not yet been extensively studied in previous research, and a naive combination of both security strategies would accumulate both overheads. In this paper, we propose CrypTag, an efficient hardware/software co-design mitigating a large class of logical memory safety issues and providing full physical memory safety. At its core, CrypTag utilizes a transparent memory encryption engine not only for physical memory safety, but also for memory coloring at hardly any additional costs. The design avoids any overhead for tag storage by embedding memory colors in the upper bits of a pointer and using these bits as an additional input for the memory encryption. A custom compiler extension automatically leverages CrypTag to detect logical memory safety issues for commodity programs and is fully backward compatible. For evaluating the design, we extended a RISC-V processor with memory encryption with CrypTag. Furthermore, we developed a LLVM-based toolchain automatically protecting all dynamic, local, and global data. Our evaluation shows a hardware overhead of less than 1% and an average runtime overhead between 1.5% and 6.1% for thwarting logical memory safety vulnerabilities on a system already featuring memory encryption. Enhancing a system with memory encryption typically induces a runtime overhead between 5% and 109.8% for commercial and open-source encryption units.",

        "abstract": "Anonymous credentials (ACs) are a powerful cryptographic tool for the secure use of digital services, when simultaneously aiming for strong privacy guarantees of users combined with strong authentication guarantees for providers of services. They allow users to selectively prove possession of attributes encoded in a credential without revealing any other meaningful information about themselves. While there is a significant body of research on AC systems, modern use-cases of ACs such as mobile applications come with various requirements not sufficiently considered so far. These include preventing the sharing of credentials and coping with resource constraints of the platforms (e.g., smart cards such as SIM cards in smartphones). Such aspects are typically out of scope of AC constructions, and, thus AC systems that can be considered entirely practical have been elusive so far. In this paper we address this problem by introducing and formalizing the notion of core/helper anonymous credentials (CHAC). The model considers a constrained core device (e.g., a SIM card) and a powerful helper device (e.g., a smartphone). The key idea is that the core device performs operations that do not depend on the size of the credential or the number of attributes, but at the same time the helper device is unable to use the credential without its help. We present a provably secure generic construction of CHACs using a combination of signatures with flexible public keys (SFPK) and the novel notion of aggregatable attribute-based equivalence class signatures (AAEQ) along with a concrete instantiation. The key characteristics of our scheme are that the size of showing tokens is independent of the number of attributes in the credential(s) and that the core device only needs to compute a single elliptic curve scalar multiplication, regardless of the number of attributes. We confirm the practical efficiency of our CHACs with an implementation of our scheme on a Multos smart card as the core and an Android smartphone as the helper device. A credential showing requires less than 500 ms on the smart card and around 200 ms on the smartphone (even for a credential with 1000 attributes).",

Such exams can be used at scale, scheduled asynchronously and/or online, and use versioning to make attempts at cheating less profitable. Despite these benefits, we want to ensure that the technique is not unfair to students, particularly when it comes to equivalent difficulty across exam versions. To investigate generated exam fairness, we use a Generalized Partial Credit Model (GPCM) Item-Response Theory (IRT) model to fit exams from a for-majors data structures course and non-majors CS0 course, both of which used randomly generated exams. For all exams, students' estimated ability and exam score are strongly correlated (ρ ≥ 0.7), suggesting that the exams are reasonably fair. Through simulation, we find that most of the variance in any given student's simulated scores is due to chance and the worst of the score impacts from possibly unfair permutations is only around 5 percentage points on an exam. We discuss implications of this work and possible future steps.",

For these reasons, containerization is massively used in an increasing number of applications. However, because containers share a full kernel with the host, they are more vulnerable to attacks that may compromise the host and the other containers on the system. In this paper, we present SNAPPY (Safe Namespaceable And Programmable PolicY), a new framework that allows even unprivileged processes such as containers to safely and dynamically enforce in the kernel fine-grained, stackable and programmable eBPF security policies at runtime. This is done by making working coordinately a new LSM (Linux Security Module) Module, a new security Linux namespace abstraction (policy_NS) and eBPF policies enriched with 'dynamic helpers'. This design especially allows to minimize containers' attack surface. Our design may be applied to any processes but is particularly suitable for container-based use cases. We show that SNAPPY can effectively increase the security level of containers for different use cases, can be easily integrated with the most relevant norms (OCI, Open Container Initiative) and containerization engines (Docker and runC) and has a performance overhead lower than 0.09% in realistic scenarios.",

        "abstract": "As quantum computers become more affordable and commonplace, existing security systems that are based on classical cryptographic primitives, such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), will no longer be secure. Hence, there has been interest in designing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes, such as those based on lattice-based cryptography (LBC). The potential of LBC schemes is evidenced by the number of such schemes passing the selection of NIST PQC Standardization Process Round-3. One such scheme is the Crystals-Dilithium signature scheme, which is based on the hard module-lattice problem. However, there is no efficient implementation of the Crystals-Dilithium signature scheme. Hence, in this article, we present a compact hardware architecture containing elaborate modular multiplication units using the Karatsuba algorithm along with smart generators of address sequence and twiddle factors for NTT, which can complete polynomial addition/multiplication with the parameter setting of Dilithium in a short clock period. Also, we propose a fast software/hardware co-design implementation on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for the Dilithium scheme with a tradeoff between speed and resource utilization. Our co-design implementation outperforms a pure C implementation on a Nios-II processor of the platform Altera DE2-115, in the sense that our implementation is 11.2 and 7.4 times faster for signature and verification, respectively. In addition, we also achieve approximately 51% and 31% speed improvement for signature and verification, in comparison to the pure C implementation on processor ARM Cortex-A9 of ZYNQ-7020 platform.",

At the same time, security researchers observe an increasing usage of steganographic methods in IT networks used by attackers to embed hidden communication in order to stay undetected as long as possible. This leads to a novel digital threat which includes the embedding of steganographic hidden communication in ICS networks. Thus, novel detection approaches specified for steganographic attacks have to be elaborated. Detectors are often based on machine learning approaches and require training and test data. However, the embedding of sophisticated hidden communication in an ICS is a very time consuming and challenging task which currently leads to a lack of suitable training and test data for the evaluation of detection mechanisms. To address this gap, this work presents an artificial steganographic network data (ASND) generation concept for an easy generation of sophisticated steganographic network data which can be provided for the evaluation of detection mechanisms. In this paper, an exemplary data set is created by ASND generation concept and used to evaluate a state-of-the-art detector and a novel detector, also introduced in this work. The accuracy of the detectors is determined and compared. The novel detector reaches a maximum detection accuracy of 92.5%.",

While an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts from this grey literature can provide insights into the trending topics and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by creating the patterns of the security knowledge gained from different sources. Prior studies neither systematically analysed the wide range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending topics from recent security texts. Moreover, existing topic modelling methods are not capable of identifying the cybersecurity concepts completely and the generated topics considerably overlap. To address this issue, we propose a semi-automated classification method to generate comprehensive security categories to analyse trending topics. We further compare the identified 16 security categories across different sources based on their popularity and impact. We have revealed several surprising findings as follows: (1) The impact reflected from cybersecurity texts strongly correlates with the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes, (2) security blogs have produced the context of cybersecurity most intensively, and (3) websites deliver security information without caring about timeliness much.",

The Weird Machine concept is an increasingly popular model for characterization of emergent execution that arises from side-effects of conventional computing constructs. In this work we introduce Microarchitectural Weird Machines (µWM): code constructions that allow performing computation through the means of side effects and conflicts between microarchitectual entities such as branch predictors and caches. The results of such computations are observed as timing variations. We demonstrate how µWMs can be used as a powerful obfuscation engine where computation operates based on events unobservable to conventional anti-obfuscation tools based on emulation, debugging, static and dynamic analysis techniques. We demonstrate that µWMs can be used to reliably perform arbitrary computation by implementing a SHA-1 hash function. We then present a practical example in which we use a µWM to obfuscate malware code such that its passive operation is invisible to an observer with full power to view the architectural state of the system until the code receives a trigger. When the trigger is received the malware decrypts and executes its payload. To show the effectiveness of obfuscation we demonstrate its use in the concealment and subsequent execution of a payload that exfiltrates a shadow password file, and a payload that creates a reverse shell.",

By default, any exchange of data between documents is governed by the Same-Origin Policy, which only permits to exchange data with other documents sharing the same protocol, host, and port. Given the move to a more interconnected Web, standard bodies and browser vendors have added new mechanisms to enable cross-origin communication, primarily domain relaxation, postMessages, and CORS. While prior work has already shown the pitfalls of not using these mechanisms securely (e.g., omitting origin checks for incoming postMessages), we instead focus on the increased attack surface created by the trust that is necessarily put into the communication partners. We report on a study of the Tranco Top 5,000 to measure the prevalence of cross-origin communication.

        "abstract": "Timed commitments [Boneh and Naor, CRYPTO 2000] are the timed analogue of standard commitments, where the commitment can be non-interactively opened after a pre-specified amount of time passes. Timed commitments have a large spectrum of applications, such as sealed bid auctions, fair contract signing, fair multi-party computation, and cryptocurrency payments. Unfortunately, all practical constructions rely on a (private-coin) trusted setup and do not scale well with the number of participants. These are two severe limiting factors that have hindered the widespread adoption of this primitive. In this work, we set out to resolve these two issues and propose an efficient timed commitment scheme that also satisfies the strong notion of CCA-security. Specifically, our scheme has a transparent (i.e. public-coin) one-time setup and the amount of sequential computation is essentially independent of the number of participants. As a key technical ingredient, we propose the first (linearly) homomorphic time-lock puzzle with a transparent setup, from class groups of imaginary quadratic order. To demonstrate the applicability of our scheme, we use it to construct a new distributed randomness generation protocol, where n parties jointly sample a random string. Our protocol is the first to simultaneously achieve (1) high scalability in the number of participants, (2) transparent one-time setup, (3) lightning speed in the optimistic case where all parties are honest, and (4) ensure that the output random string is unpredictable and unbiased, even when the adversary corrupts $n-1$ parties. To substantiate the practicality of our approach, we implemented our protocol and our experimental evaluation shows that it is fast enough to be used in practice. We also evaluated a heuristic version of the protocol that is at least 3 orders of magnitude more efficient both in terms of communication size and computation time. This makes the protocol suitable for supporting hundreds of participants.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art object detectors are vulnerable to localized patch hiding attacks, where an adversary introduces a small adversarial patch to make detectors miss the detection of salient objects. The patch attacker can carry out a physical-world attack by printing and attaching an adversarial patch to the victim object; thus, it imposes a challenge for the safe deployment of object detectors. In this paper, we propose DetectorGuard as the first general framework for building provably robust object detectors against localized patch hiding attacks. DetectorGuard is inspired by recent advancements in robust image classification research; we ask: can we adapt robust image classifiers for robust object detection? Unfortunately, due to their task difference, an object detector naively adapted from a robust image classifier 1) may not necessarily be robust in the adversarial setting or 2) even maintain decent performance in the clean setting. To address these two issues and build a high-performance robust object detector, we propose an objectness explaining strategy: we adapt a robust image classifier to predict objectness (i.e., the probability of an object being present) for every image location and then explain each objectness using the bounding boxes predicted by a conventional object detector. If all objectness is well explained, we output the predictions made by the conventional object detector; otherwise, we issue an attack alert. Notably, our objectness explaining strategy enables provable robustness for \"free\": 1) in the adversarial setting, we formally prove the end-to-end robustness of DetectorGuard on certified objects, i.e., it either detects the object or triggers an alert, against any patch hiding attacker within our threat model; 2) in the clean setting, we have almost the same performance as state-of-the-art object detectors. Our evaluation on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and KITTI datasets further demonstrates that DetectorGuard achieves the first provable robustness against localized patch hiding attacks at a negligible cost (< 1%) of clean performance.",

As such, these systems need to guarantee that the sensor data is acquired by the correct device and has not been tampered with. However, IoT sensing systems can be quite complex and are often composed of multiple components, i.e., a main device and subordinate sensors. The main device is responsible for gathering and processing the data from the subordinate sensor and reports the result to a server. In order to guarantee data correctness, we introduce two types of physically unclonable function (PUF): one for the main device and one for the subordinate sensor. The main device has a trusted execution environment (TEE) for critical processing, and the correctness of the TEE is guaranteed by remote attestation based on a PUF. The subordinate sensor sends the sensor data to the main device with a message authentication code (MAC) based on a PUF. We implemented a trusted IoT sensing system using a RISC-V Keystone with a PRINCE Glitch PUF for the main device and a Raspberry Pi that simulates a CMOS image sensor PUF for the subordinate sensor.",

Conventional low-level programming languages such as C and assembly are efficient, but their inherent unsafe nature makes it undesirable for security-critical scenarios. Recently, Rust has become a promising alternative for safe system-level programming. While giving programmers fine-grained hardware control, its strong type system enforces many security properties including memory safety. However, Rust's security guarantee is not a silver bullet. Runtime crashes and memory-safety errors still harass Rust developers, causing damaging exploitable vulnerabilities, as reported by numerous studies. In this paper, we present and evaluate MirChecker, a fully automated bug detection framework for Rust programs by performing static analysis on Rust's Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR). Based on the observation of existing bugs found in Rust codebases, our approach keeps track of both numerical and symbolic information, detects potential runtime crashes and memory-safety errors by using constraint solving techniques, and outputs informative diagnostics to users. We evaluate MirChecker on both buggy code snippets extracted from existing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and real-world Rust codebases. Our experiments show that MirChecker can detect all the issues in our code snippets, and is capable of performing bug finding in real-world scenarios, where it detected a total of 33 previously unknown bugs including 16 memory-safety issues from 12 Rust packages (crates) with an acceptable false-positive rate.",

However, such fully integrated sandboxing could overwhelm the lightweight and scalable nature of the containers. In this work, we propose a partially fortified sandboxing mechanism that concentratedly fortifies the network isolation, focusing on the fact that containerized clouds and the applications running on them require different isolation levels in accordance with their unique characteristics. We describe how to efficiently implement the mechanism to fortify network isolation for containers with a para-passthrough hypervisor and report evaluation results with benchmarks and real applications.

Ubiquity of cyber-physical systems necessitates some level of assurance about the secure flow of information through different discrete and continuous components. In recent years, different logical frameworks have been proposed to analyze indirect information flows in cyber-physical systems. While these frameworks are used to verify secure flow of information in a metalevel, they naturally fall short in support of implementing information flow analyzers that could effectively enforce policies at runtime. This practical limitation has triggered the implementation of direct information flow analyzers in different language settings. In this paper, we focus on direct flows of information confidentiality in hybrid-dynamic environments and propose a semantic framework through which we can judge about such flows. This semantic framework can be used to study the correctness of enforced policies by these analyzers, and in particular taint tracking tools. In this regard, we specify a dynamic taint tracking policy for hybrid dynamic systems and prove its soundness based on the proposed semantic framework. As a case study, we consider the flow of information in a public transportation control system, and the effectiveness of our enforced policy on this system.",

However, what devices are connected to a network may not be known by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), since many IoT devices are placed within small networks (e.g., home networks) and are hidden behind network address translation (NAT). Without pinpointing IoT devices in a network, it is unlikely for the ISP to appropriately configure security policies and effectively manage the network. Additionally, inferring fine-grained user interactions of IoT devices is also an interesting yet unresolved problem. In this paper, we design an efficient and scalable system via spatial-temporal traffic fingerprinting from an ISP&#x2019;s perspective in consideration of practical issues like learning-testing asymmetry. Our system can accurately identify typical IoT devices in a network, with the additional capability of identifying what devices are hidden behind NAT and the number of each type of device that share the same IP address. Our system can also detect user interactions and meanwhile identify their (concurrent) number through a multi-output regression model. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that the system can generally identify IoT devices with an F1-Score above 0.999, and estimate the number of the same type of IoT device behind NAT with an average error below 5&#x0025;. By studying 29 user interactions of 7 devices, we show that our system is promising in detecting user interactions.",

        "abstract": "The performance of persistent applications is severely hurt by current secure processor architectures. Persistent applications use long-latency flush instructions and memory fences to make sure that writes to persistent data reach the persistency domain in a way that is crash consistent. Recently introduced features like Intel’s Asynchronous DRAM Refresh (ADR) make the on-chip Write Pending Queue (WPQ) part of the persistency domain and help reduce the penalty of persisting data since data only needs to reach the on-chip WPQ to be considered persistent. However, when persistent applications run on secure processors, for the sake of securing memory many cycles are added to the critical path of their write operations before they ever reach the persistent WPQ, preventing them from fully exploiting the performance advantages of the persistent WPQ. Our goal in this work is to make it feasible for secure persistent applications to benefit more from the on-chip persistency domain.  We propose Dolos, an architecture that prioritizes persisting data without sacrificing security in order to gain a significant performance boost for persistent applications. Dolos achieves this goal by an additional minor security unit, Mi-SU, that utilizes a much faster secure process that protects only the WPQ. Thus, the secure operation latency in the critical path of persist operations is reduced and hence persistent transactions can complete earlier. Dolos retains a conventional major security unit for protecting memory that occurs off the critical path after inserting secured data into the WPQ. To evaluate our design, we implemented our architecture in the GEM5 simulator, and analyzed the performance of 6 benchmarks from the WHISPER suite. Dolos improves their performance by 1.66x on average.",

They are the gold standard in many clinical, social, and behavioral fields of study. However, the most important settings often involve the most sensitive data, therefore cause privacy concerns. In this paper, we outline a way to deploy an end-to-end privacy-preserving protocol for learning causal effects from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). We are particularly focused on the difficult and important case where one party determines which treatment an individual receives, and another party measures outcomes on individuals, and these parties do not want to leak any of their information to each other, but still want to collectively learn a true causal effect in the world. Moreover, we show how such a protocol can be scaled to 500 million rows of data and more than a billion gates. We also offer an open source deployment of this protocol. We accomplish this by a three-stage solution, interconnecting and blending three privacy technologies--private set intersection, multiparty computation, and differential privacy--to address core points of privacy leakage, at the join, at the point of computation, and at the release, respectively. The first stage uses the Private-ID protocol[8] to create a private encrypted join of the users. The second stage utilizes the encrypted join to run multiple instances of a general purpose MPC over a sharded database to aggregate statistics about each experimental group while discarding individuals who took an action before they received treatment. The third stage adds distributed and calibrated Differential Privacy (DP) noise within the final MPC computations to the released aggregate statistical estimates of causal effects and their uncertainty measures, providing formal two-sided privacy guarantees. We also evaluate the performance of multiple open source general purpose MPC libraries for this task. We additionally demonstrate how we have used this to create a working ads effectiveness measurement product capable of measuring hundreds of millions of individuals per experiment.",

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are considered one of the major security threats in cloud computing. Without a proper defense mechanism, an attack against one tenant can also affect the availability of cotenants. This work uses a game-theoretic approach to analyze the interactions between various entities when the cloud is under attack. The resulting Nash equilibrium shows that collateral damage to cotenants is unlikely if the cloud service provider is unbiased and chooses a rational strategy, but the Nash equilibrium can change when the cloud service provider does not treat cloud consumers equally. The cloud service provider's bias can influence its strategy selection and create a situation where untargeted users suffer unnecessary collateral damage from DDoS attacks.",

However, this has also raised major privacy and efficiency concerns that need to be addressed. While sharing clinical data across the cloud that often consists of sensitive patient-related information, privacy is a major challenge. Adequate protection of patients’ privacy helps to increase public trust in medical research. Additionally, DL-based models are complex, and in a cloud-based approach, efficient data processing in such models is complicated. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and secure cancer diagnostic framework for histopathological image classification by utilizing both differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. For efficient computation, instead of performing the whole operation on the cloud, we decouple the layers into two modules: one for feature extraction using the VGGNet\\(\\) module at the user side and the remaining layers for private prediction over the cloud. The efficacy of the framework is validated on two datasets composed of histopathological images of the canine mammary tumor and human breast cancer. The application of differential privacy preserving to the proposed model makes the model secure and capable of preserving the privacy of sensitive data from any adversary, without significantly compromising the model accuracy. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model efficiently achieves the trade-off between privacy and model performance.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of block-chain technologies, more and more engineers use smart contracts for application implementation. Traditional supporting tools can either provide code completions based on static libraries or detect a limited set of vulnerabilities, which results in the manpower waste during coding and miss-detection of bugs. In this work, we propose SCStudio, a unified smart contract development platform, which aims to help developers implement more secure smart contracts easily. The core idea is to realize real-time security-reinforced recommendation through pattern-based learning; and to perform security-oriented validation via integrated testing. SCStudio was implemented as a plug-in of VS Code. It has been used as the official development tool of WeBank and integrated as the recommended development tool by FISCO-BCOS community. In practice, it outperforms existing contract development environments, such as Remix, improving the average word suggestion accuracy by 30%-60% and helping detect about 25% more vulnerabilities.

To avoid privacy leakage, some privacy-preserving mechanisms must be adopted to protect raters’ privacy and make evaluation trust reliable. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes an efficient service recommendation and evaluation scheme, called EPRT, which is based on a similarity calculation and trust discovery method. This scheme uses homomorphic encryption technology to encrypt the sensitive data and combines the threshold mechanism and double-trap mechanism to realize the secure computing on the encrypted data, so as to ensure that the plaintexts of the final calculation results (e.g., recommendation value and evaluation truth) are only obtained by the authorized subject. In addition, a detailed security analysis shows that the proposed EPRT scheme can achieve the expected security. In addition, performance comparison results are carried out, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy.",

DRIP is a newly proposed protocol for drones that aims to enable users to securely identify drones and trust in messages sent by them. However, some implementation details, such as registries, are yet to be determined. The decentralization, auditability and persistency of blockchain makes it a great candidate to be used as a registry in DRIP. This paper analyzes how Hyperledger Iroha, a permission-based blockchain framework, can be used to fulfill the registry requirements in DRIP, and propose an architecture using it as a registry. Findings show that, thanks to its support for various permissions, multi-signature transactions, and smart contracts, it is able to not only fulfill the requirements, but also enhance other security details of the proposed architecture. Furthermore, this paper also evaluates the performance of Iroha, with results showing that its low consensus delay is adequate to be used for real-time location updates.",

        "abstract": "Biometric cryptosystems such as fuzzy vaults represent one of the most popular approaches for secret and biometric template protection. However, they are solely designed for biometric verification, where the user is required to input both identity credentials and biometrics. Several practical questions related to the implementation of biometric cryptosystems remain open, especially in regard to biometric template protection. In this article, we propose a face cryptosystem for identification (FCI) in which only biometric input is needed. Our FCI is composed of a one-to-N search subsystem for template protection and a one-to-one match chaff-less fuzzy vault (CFV) subsystem for secret protection. The first subsystem stores N facial features, which are protected by index-of-maximum (IoM) hashing, enhanced by a fusion module for search accuracy. When a face image of the user is presented, the subsystem returns the top k matching scores and activates the corresponding vaults in the CFV subsystem. Then, one-to-one matching is applied to the k vaults based on the probe face, and the identifier or secret associated with the user is retrieved from the correct matched vault. We demonstrate that coupling between the IoM hashing and the CFV resolves several practical issues related to fuzzy vault schemes. The FCI system is evaluated on three large-scale public unconstrained face datasets (LFW, VGG2, and IJB-C) in terms of its accuracy, computation cost, template protection criteria, and security.",

Ethereum is a blockchain platform that anyone can use to create and deploy decentralized applications that run on the blockchain network.

        "abstract": "The sharing of last-level cache (LLC) among different CPU cores makes cache vulnerable to side channel attacks. An attacker can get private information about co-running applications (victims) by monitoring their accesses in LLC. Cache side channel attacks can be mitigated by partitioning cache between the victim and attacker. However, previous partition works either make weak assumptions about the attacker's strength or force their security mechanisms and thus overhead to every user on the system, regardless of their security requirement. We argue that offering security protection as a service is a better choice for secure cache design. To achieve this, we propose Invisible-Victim cache (IVcache), a new cache partition design targeting both the original LLC attack and the new variant. IVcache classifies all security domains on the system as protected and unprotected. For LLC accesses from protected domains, IVcache handles cache state changes in a slightly different way to make those accesses invisible to any other security domains. We implement and evaluate IVcache in Gem5. The experimental results show that IVcache can defend against real-world attacks, and that it introduces negligible performance overhead to protected domains and no overhead to unprotected domains.",

        "abstract": "In security frameworks for speculative execution, an instruction is said to reach its Visibility Point (VP) when it is no longer vulnerable to pipeline squashes. Before a potentially leaky instruction reaches its VP, it has to stall—unless a defense scheme such as invisible speculation provides protection. Unfortunately, either stalling or protecting the execution of pre-VP instructions typically has a performance cost.  One way to attain low-overhead safe execution is to develop techniques that speed-up the advance of the VP from older to younger instructions. In this paper, we propose one such technique. We find that the progress of the VP for loads is mostly impeded by waiting until no memory consistency violations (MCVs) are possible. Hence, our technique, called , tries to make loads invulnerable to MCVs as early as possible—a process we call pinning the loads in the pipeline. The result is faster VP progress and a reduction in the execution overhead of defense schemes. In this paper, we describe the hardware needed by , and two possible designs with different tradeoffs between hardware requirements and performance. Our evaluation shows that is very effective: extending three popular defense schemes against speculative execution attacks with reduces their average execution overhead on SPEC17 and on SPLASH2/PARSEC applications by about 50%. For example, on SPEC17, the execution overhead of the three defense schemes decreases from to , from to , and from to .",

At the same time, it is now frequent that the owner of the data and the owner of the computing infrastructure are two entities with limited trust between them (e. g., volunteer computing or the hybrid-cloud). Recently, trusted execution environments (TEEs) became a viable solution to ensure the security of systems in such environments. However, the performance of relational operators in TEEs remains an open problem. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study to identify the main bottlenecks and challenges when executing relational equi-joins in TEEs. For this, we introduce TEEbench, a framework for unified benchmarking of relational operators in TEEs, and use it for conducting our experimental evaluation. In a nutshell, we perform the following experimental analysis for eight core join algorithms: off-the-shelf performance; the performance implications of data sealing and obliviousness; sensitivity and scalability. The results show that all eight join algorithms significantly suffer from different performance bottlenecks in TEEs. They can be up to three orders of magnitude slower in TEEs than on plain CPUs. Our study also indicates that existing join algorithms need a complete, hardware-aware redesign to be efficient in TEEs, and that, in secure query plans, managing TEE features is equally important to join selection.",

        "abstract": "The concept of proportional representation in approval-based committee elections has appeared in the social choice literature for over a century and is typically understood as avoiding the underrepresentation of minorities. However, we argue that the security of some distributed systems critically depends on the opposite goal of preventing the overrepresentation of any minority, a goal not previously formalized that leads us to an optimization objective known as maximin support. After providing a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of this objective, we propose a new efficient election rule that simultaneously achieves a) a constant-factor approximation guarantee for it, and b) the property of proportional justified representation (PJR) - one of the strongest forms of proportional representation. However, the most striking feature of the new rule is that one can verify in linear time that the winning committee satisfies the two aforementioned guarantees, even when the algorithm is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output. As a result, the rule can be adapted into a verifiable computing scheme. Moreover, its verification procedure easily admits parallel processing for further efficiency. Our work is motivated by an application on blockchain networks that implement Nominated Proof-of-Stake, where the community elects a committee of validators to participate in the consensus protocol, and where preventing overrepresentation protects the network against attacks by an adversarial minority. Our election rule enables a validator selection protocol with formal guarantees on security and proportionality, and its adaptation as a verifiable computing scheme with a parallelized verification proves to be key for its successful implementation given the computationally limited nature of the blockchain architecture.",

        "abstract": "From facial recognition to autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform the way we live and work over the next couple of decades. Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients. All these improvements make StarFL more applicable to the security-sensitive scenarios for the next generation of urban computing.",

Our construction relies on the existence of a computational sub-exponentially secure private information retrieval (PIR) scheme.The proof exploits a curious connection between the problem of computation delegation and the model of multi-prover interactive proofs that are sound against no-signaling (cheating) strategies, a model that was studied in the context of multi-prover interactive proofs with provers that share quantum entanglement, and is motivated by the physical principle that information cannot travel faster than light.For any language computable in time t = t(n), we construct a multi-prover interactive proof (MIP), that is, sound against no-signaling strategies, where the running time of the provers is poly(t), the number of provers is polylog(t), and the running time of the verifier is n · polylog(t).In particular, this shows that the class of languages that have polynomial-time MIPs that are sound against no-signaling strategies, is exactly EXP. Previously, this class was only known to contain PSPACE.To convert our MIP into a 1-round delegation scheme, we use the method suggested by Aiello et al. (ICALP, 2000), which makes use of a PIR scheme. This method lacked a proof of security. We prove that this method is secure assuming the underlying MIP is secure against no-signaling provers.",

One core obstacle is the existence of concept drift, an issue for all adversary-facing security systems. Additionally, specific challenges set intrusion detection apart from other ML-based security tasks, such as malware detection. In this work, we offer a new perspective on these challenges. We propose INSOMNIA, a semi-supervised intrusion detector which continuously updates the underlying ML model as network traffic characteristics are affected by concept drift. We use active learning to reduce latency in the model updates, label estimation to reduce labeling overhead, and apply explainable AI to better interpret how the model reacts to the shifting distribution. To evaluate INSOMNIA, we extend TESSERACT - a framework originally proposed for performing sound time-aware evaluations of ML-based malware detectors - to the network intrusion domain. Our evaluation shows that accounting for drifting scenarios is vital for effective intrusion detection systems.",

Hence, there has been a trend of moving to decentralized voting systems, such as those based on blockchain. The latter is a decentralized digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network, where a copy of the append-only ledger of digitally signed and encrypted transactions is maintained by each participant. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of blockchain-based voting systems and classify them based on a number of features (e.g., the types of blockchain used, the consensus approaches used, and the scale of participants). By systematically analyzing and comparing the different blockchain-based voting systems, we also identify a number of limitations and research opportunities.

This experience report seeks to identify and share teaching strategies that impact student learning, efficacy, and sense of self/belonging in the field of Computer Science, for all students. In an effort to design learning opportunities to help bridge the gap between the haves and have nots, and maximize learning for all students, this strategy uses CTF-based instruction as a way to generate and support culture-based, computer science experiences. The aim is to identify instructional strategies that build students' computing skills and improve their comfort participating in computing activities thus broadening participation in computing and cybersecurity. As students' comfort is related to their self-efficacy and sense of belonging, we explore the integration of co-curricular opportunities, specifically a capture-the-flag (CTF) approach to computer science instruction, as means of increasing student success, with regard to learning, efficacy, and sense of belonging/identity. This report involves a description of the class activities as well as data from a series of pre- and post- surveys of the student experience, attitudes, and gain in knowledge.

It has been proven to be an effective approach to alleviate the I/O bottleneck. To facilitate in-storage computing, many frameworks have been proposed. However, few of them treat the in-storage security as the first citizen. Specifically, since modern SSD controllers do not have a trusted execution environment, an offloaded (malicious) program could steal, modify, and even destroy the data stored in the SSD.  In this paper, we first investigate the attacks that could be conducted by offloaded in-storage programs. To defend against these attacks, we build a lightweight trusted execution environment, named IceClave for in-storage computing. IceClave enables security isolation between in-storage programs and flash management functions that include flash address translation, data access control, and garbage collection, with TrustZone extensions. IceClave also achieves security isolation between in-storage programs by enforcing memory integrity verification of in-storage DRAM with low overhead. To protect data loaded from flash chips, IceClave develops a lightweight data encryption/decryption mechanism in flash controllers. We develop IceClave with a full system simulator. We evaluate IceClave with a variety of data-intensive applications such as databases. Compared to state-of-the-art in-storage computing approaches, IceClave introduces only 7.6% performance overhead, while enforcing security isolation in the SSD controller with minimal hardware cost. IceClave still keeps the performance benefit of in-storage computing by delivering up to 2.31 × better performance than the conventional host-based trusted computing approach.",

However, encrypting data alone is insufficient as the memory address itself can leak sensitive information. In this work, we exploit packetized memory interface to provide secure memory access and support oblivious computation in a system with multiple memory modules interconnected with a multi-hop, memory-centric network. While the memory address can be encrypted with a packetized memory interface, simply encrypting the address does not provide full oblivious computation since coarse-grain memory access patterns can be leaked. In this work, we first propose a scalable encryption microarchitecture with source-based routing where the packet is only encrypted once at source and latency overhead in intermediate routers is minimized. We then define secure routing in memory-centric networks to enable oblivious computation such that memory access patterns across the memory modules are completely obfuscated. We explore different naive secure routing algorithms to ensure oblivious computation but they come with high performance overhead. To minimize performance overhead, we propose ghost packets that replace dummy packets with existing network traffic. We also propose Ghost routing that batches multiple ghost packets together to minimize bandwidth loss from naive secure routing while exploiting random routing.",

ITS has become more complicated and uncertain due to the existing security and privacy problems. Blockchain, being a decentralized and tamper-resistant technology, can provide an environment for ITS, allowing ITS entities to perform transactions securely and trustfully. However, the inefficiency problem of blockchain, severely restricts its development and application. Studies only combine traditional blockchain with ITS, but do not consider scaling blockchain to improve performance. This paper devotes to scale blockchain that adapted to ITS, improving the efficiency of the blockchain without sacrificing the decentralization and security. A sharding scheme is proposed, which takes network sharding, data sharding and state sharding into account. Nodes are divided into several shards. Different shards can process data in parallel and store related data in their own ledger. Backup shard is put forward in this paper to enhance the shard security. And network will reshuffle when one or more shards break down. Some experiments are performed using Hyperledger Fabric and network simulator 3. Throghput, storage and delay are tested under sharding scheme and non sharding solution. The results show that sharding method is effective in scaling blockchain for ITS.",

However, recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to attacks against their training data. Membership inference is one major attack in this domain: Given a data sample and model, an adversary aims to determine whether the sample is part of the model's training set. Existing membership inference attacks leverage the confidence scores returned by the model as their inputs (score-based attacks). However, these attacks can be easily mitigated if the model only exposes the predicted label, i.e., the final model decision. In this paper, we propose decision-based membership inference attacks and demonstrate that label-only exposures are also vulnerable to membership leakage. In particular, we develop two types of decision-based attacks, namely transfer attack and boundary attack. Empirical evaluation shows that our decision-based attacks can achieve remarkable performance, and even outperform the previous score-based attacks in some cases. We further present new insights on the success of membership inference based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, i.e., member samples of a model are more distant to the model's decision boundary than non-member samples. Finally, we evaluate multiple defense mechanisms against our decision-based attacks and show that our two types of attacks can bypass most of these defenses.",

        "abstract": "Data is the key factor to drive the development of machine learning (ML) during the past decade. However, high-quality data, in particular labeled data, is often hard and expensive to collect. To leverage large-scale unlabeled data, self-supervised learning, represented by contrastive learning, is introduced. The objective of contrastive learning is to map different views derived from a training sample (e.g., through data augmentation) closer in their representation space, while different views derived from different samples more distant. In this way, a contrastive model learns to generate informative representations for data samples, which are then used to perform downstream ML tasks. Recent research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to various privacy attacks. However, most of the current efforts concentrate on models trained with supervised learning. Meanwhile, data samples' informative representations learned with contrastive learning may cause severe privacy risks as well. In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of contrastive learning through the lens of membership inference and attribute inference. Our experimental results show that contrastive models trained on image datasets are less vulnerable to membership inference attacks but more vulnerable to attribute inference attacks compared to supervised models. The former is due to the fact that contrastive models are less prone to overfitting, while the latter is caused by contrastive models' capability of representing data samples expressively. To remedy this situation, we propose the first privacy-preserving contrastive learning mechanism, Talos, relying on adversarial training. Empirical results show that Talos can successfully mitigate attribute inference risks for contrastive models while maintaining their membership privacy and model utility.",

        "abstract": "The increasing autonomy and connectivity in cyber-physical systems (CPS) come with new security vulnerabilities that are easily exploitable by malicious attackers to spoof a system to perform dangerous actions. While the vast majority of existing works focus on attack prevention and detection, the key question is “what to do after detecting an attack?”. This problem attracts fairly rare attention though its significance is emphasized by the need to mitigate or even eliminate attack impacts on a system. In this article, we study this attack response problem and propose novel real-time recovery for securing CPS. First, this work’s core component is a recovery control calculator using a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with timing and safety constraints. This component can smoothly steer back a physical system under control to a target state set before a safe deadline and maintain the system state in the set once it is driven to it. We further propose an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm that can fast solve the LQR-based recovery problem. Second, supporting components for the attack recovery computation include a checkpointer, a state reconstructor, and a deadline estimator. To realize these components respectively, we propose (i) a sliding-window-based checkpointing protocol that governs sufficient trustworthy data, (ii) a state reconstruction approach that uses the checkpointed data to estimate the current system state, and (iii) a reachability-based approach to conservatively estimate a safe deadline. Finally, we implement our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in dealing with totally 15 experimental scenarios which are designed based on 5 CPS simulators and 3 types of sensor attacks.",

Wireless Direction of Arrival (DoA) techniques, such as the MUSIC algorithm, can localize drones, but deploying a system that systematically localizes RF emissions can lead to intentional or unintentional (e.g., if compromised) abuse. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) provides a solution for controlled computation of the elevation of RF emissions, only revealing estimates when some conditions are met, such as when the elevation exceeds a specified threshold. However, we show that a straightforward implementation of MUSIC, which relies on costly computation of complex matrix operations such as eigendecomposition, in state of the art MPC frameworks is extremely inefficient requiring over 20 seconds to achieve the weakest security guarantees. In this work, we develop a set of MPC optimizations and extensions of MUSIC. We extensively evaluate our techniques in several MPC protocols achieving a speedup of 300-500 times depending on the security model and specific technique used.

In an MP attack, the various components required in a PR attack, including an NFC reader, a wireless link, a remote card emulator, and a remote payment terminal, are conveniently combined into one compact device, hence the attack becomes much easier. Since the attacker and the victim are in the same location, the previous distance bounding or ambient sensor-based solutions are no longer effective. In this paper, we propose a new orientation-based payment solution called OPay. OPay builds on the observation that when a user makes a legitimate contactless payment, the card and the terminal surface are naturally aligned, but in an attack scenario, this situation is less likely to occur. This allows us to distinguish the legitimate payments from passive attacks based on measuring the alignment of orientations. We build a concrete prototype using two Arduino boards embedded with NFC and motion sensors to act as a card and a payment terminal respectively. To evaluate the feasibility, we recruited twenty volunteers in a user study. Participants generally find OPay easy to use, fast and reliable. Experiments show that OPay can substantially reduce the attack success rate by 85-99% with little inconvenience to real users. To our best knowledge, OPay is the first solution that can prevent both the PR and MP attacks, while preserving the existing usage model in contactless payment.",

While seccomp provides a solution for filtering syscalls, it requires manual implementation of filter rules for each individual application. Recent work has investigated approaches to automate this task. However, as we show, these approaches make assumptions that are not necessary or require overly time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose Chestnut, an automated approach for generating strict syscall filters with lower requirements and limitations. Chestnut comprises two phases, with the first phase consisting of two static components, i.e., a compiler and a binary analyzer, that statically extract the used syscalls. The compiler-based approach of Chestnut is up to factor 73 faster than previous approaches with the same accuracy. On the binary level, our approach extends over previous ones by also applying to non-PIC binaries. An optional second phase of Chestnut is dynamic refinement to restrict the set of allowed syscalls further. We demonstrate that Chestnut on average blocks 302 syscalls (86.5%) via the compiler and 288 (82.5%) using the binary analysis on a set of 18 applications. Chestnut blocks the dangerous exec syscall in 50% and 77.7% of the tested applications using the compiler- and binary-based approach, respectively. For the tested applications, Chestnut blocks exploitation of more than 61% of the 175 CVEs that target the kernel via syscalls.",

To improve its scalability, a number of automated contact tracing (ACT) solutions have been proposed, and some of them have been deployed. Despite the dedicated efforts, security and privacy issues of these solutions are still open and under intensive debate. In this article, we examine the ACT concept from a broader perspective, by focusing on not only security and privacy issues but also functional issues such as interface, usability, and coverage. We first elaborate on these issues and particularly point out the inevitable privacy leakages in existing Bluetooth Low Energy based ACT solutions, including centralized and decentralized ones. In addition, we examine the existing venue-based ACT solutions and identify their privacy and security concerns. Then, we propose a generic venue-based ACT solution and a concrete instantiation based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Our solution monitors users’ contacting history only in virus-spreading-prone venues and offers higher-level protection for both security and privacy than its predecessors. Finally, we evaluate our solution from security, privacy, and efficiency perspectives, and also highlight how to reduce false positives in some specific indoor environments.",

To protect data security and privacy in the untrusted cloud-fog environment, many cryptographic mechanisms have been invented. Unfortunately, most of them are impractical when directly applied to cloud-fog IoT computing, mainly due to the large number of resource-constrained end-devices (EDs). In this paper, we present a secure cloud-fog IoT data sharing system with bilateral access control based on a new cryptographic tool called lightweight matchmaking encryption.

Vehicles have already been attacked and will become even more attractive targets due to their increasing connectivity, the amount of data they produce and their importance to our society. It is therefore crucial to provide cyber security measures to prevent and limit the impact of attacks.  As it is problematic for a vehicle to reliably assess its own state when it is compromised, we investigate how vehicle trust can be used to identify compromised vehicles and how fleet-wide attacks can be detected at an early stage using cloud data. In our proposed V2C Anomaly Detection framework, peer vehicles assess each other based on their perceived behavior in traffic and V2X-enabled interactions, and upload these assessments to the cloud for analysis. This framework consists of four modules. For each module we define functional demands, interfaces and evaluate solutions proposed in literature allowing manufacturers and fleet owners to choose appropriate techniques. We detail attack scenarios where this type of framework is particularly useful in detecting and identifying potential attacks and failing software and hardware. Furthermore, we describe what basic vehicle data the cloud analysis can be based upon.",

Since its source codes are usually unavailable, software reuse is hard to be detected with interpretation. On the other hand, current approaches suffer from poor detection accuracy and efficiency, far from satisfying practical demands. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose ISRD, an interpretation-enabled software reuse detection approach based on a multi-level birthmark model that contains function level, basic block level, and instruction level. To overcome obfuscation caused by cross-compilation, we represent function semantics with Minimum Branch Path (MBP) and perform normalization to extract core semantics of instructions. For efficiently detecting reused functions, a process for \"intent search based on anchor recognition\" is designed to speed up reuse detection. It uses strict instruction match and identical library call invocation check to find anchor functions (in short anchors) and then traverses neighbors of the anchors to explore potentially matched function pairs. Extensive experiments based on two real-world binary datasets reveal that ISRD is interpretable, effective, and efficient, which achieves 97.2% precision and 94.8% recall. Moreover, it is resilient to cross-compilation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

We present attacks based on micro-architectural hardware vulnerabilities and the side effects they produce in the system. In addition, we present security mechanisms that can be implemented to address some of these attacks. Most of the security mechanisms target a small set of attack vectors or a single specific attack vector. As many attack vectors exist, solutions must be found to protect against a wide variety of threats.

Understanding the factors that contribute to students’ motivation and persistence is critical to helping educators, administrators, and industry professionals better focus efforts to improve academic outcomes and job placement. This article examines how experiences contribute to a student’s computing identity, which we define by their interest, recognition, sense of belonging, and competence/performance beliefs. In particular, we consider groups underrepresented in these disciplines, women and minoritized racial/ethnic groups (Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx). To delve into these relationships, a survey of more than 1,600 students in computing fields was conducted at three metropolitan public universities in Florida. Regression was used to elucidate which experiences predict computing identity and how social identification (i.e., as female, Black/African American, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) may interact with these experiences. Our results suggest that several types of experiences positively predict a student’s computing identity, such as mentoring others, having a job, or having friends in computing. Moreover, certain experiences have a different effect on computing identity for female and Hispanic/Latinx students. More specifically, receiving academic advice from teaching assistants was more positive for female students, receiving advice from industry professionals was more negative for Hispanic/Latinx students, and receiving help on classwork from students in their class was more positive for Hispanic/Latinx students. Other experiences, while having the same effect on computing identity across students, were experienced at significantly different rates by females, Black/African American students, and Hispanic/Latinx students. The findings highlight experiential ways in which computing programs can foster computing identity development, particularly for underrepresented and marginalized groups in computing.",

Specifically, to successfully restore NVMs to their working states after unexpected system crashes or power failure, maintaining and recovering all the necessary security-related metadata can severely increase memory traffic, degrade runtime performance, exacerbate write endurance problem, and demand costly hardware changes to off-the-shelf processors.In this article, we designed and implemented ARES, a new FPGA-assisted processor-transparent security mechanism that aims at efficiently and effectively achieving all three aspects of a security triad—confidentiality, integrity, and recoverability—in modern embedded computing. Given the growing prominence of CPU-FPGA heterogeneous computing architectures, ARES leverages FPGA’s hardware reconfigurability to offload performance-critical and security-related functions to the programmable hardware without microprocessors’ involvement. In particular, recognizing that the traditional Merkle tree caching scheme cannot fully exploit FPGA’s parallelism due to its sequential and recursive function calls, we (1) proposed a Merkle tree cache architecture that partitions a unified cache into multiple levels with parallel accesses and (2) further designed a novel Merkle tree scheme that flattened and reorganized the computation in the traditional Merkle tree verification and update processes to fully exploit the parallel cache ports and to fully pipeline time-consuming hashing operations. Beyond that, to accelerate the metadata recovery process, multiple parallel recovery units are instantiated to recover counter metadata and multiple Merkle sub-trees.Our hardware prototype of the ARES system on a Xilinx U200 platform shows that ARES achieved up to 1.4× lower latency and 2.6× higher throughput against the baseline implementation, while metadata recovery time was shortened by 1.8 times. When integrated with an embedded processor, neither hardware changes nor software changes are required. We also developed a theoretical framework to analytically model and explain experimental results.",

While it allows interoperability, past research efforts have shown that it provides robust inference points that an attacker can leverage to reveal sensitive design information through binary reverse engineering. In this work, we aim to reduce the ability of an attacker to successfully reverse engineer a binary. We do this via removal of what we call ABI Bias, i.e., the reverse engineering bias that manifests due to a compiler’s adherence to the ABI.  Specifically, we identify two types of ABI biases that are central to past reverse engineering works on C++ binaries: VTable ordering bias and Function Pointer bias. We present compiler-based techniques that can correctly and efficiently debias a given binary from the aforementioned biases. We evaluate our proof-of-concept implementation on a corpus of real world programs for binary size, correctness and performance. We report an average increase of 1.42% in binary size compared to the baseline, very low performance overhead and lastly, correct execution of evaluation programs in comparison to the baseline.

This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

Existing state-of-the-art memory timing side channel mitigations have several key performance and security limitations. Prior schemes require onerous static bandwidth partitioning, extensive profiling phases, or simply fail to protect against attacks which exploit fine-grained timing and bank information. We present DAGguise, a defense mechanism which fully protects against memory timing side channels while allowing for dynamic traffic contention in order to achieve good performance. DAGguise utilizes a novel abstract memory access representation, the Directed Acyclic Request Graph (rDAG for short), to model memory access patterns which experience contention. DAGguise shapes a victim’s memory access patterns according to a publicly known rDAG obtained through a lightweight profiling stage, completely eliminating information leakage.  We formally verify the security of DAGguise, proving that it maintains strong security guarantees. Moreover, by allowing dynamic traffic contention, DAGguise achieves a 12% overall system speedup relative to Fixed Service, which is the state-of-the-art mitigation mechanism, with up to a 20% relative speedup for co-located applications which do not require protection. We further claim that the principles of DAGguise can be generalized to protect against other types of scheduler-based timing side channels, such as those targeting on-chip networks, or functional units in SMT cores.",

To save power and protect user privacy, voice assistants send commands to the cloud only if a small set of preregistered wake-up words are detected. However, voice assistants are shown to be vulnerable to the FakeWake phenomena, whereby they are inadvertently triggered by innocent-sounding fuzzy words. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the FakeWake phenomena from three aspects. To start with, we design the first fuzzy word generator to automatically and efficiently produce fuzzy words instead of searching through a swarm of audio materials.We manage to generate 965 fuzzy words covering 8 most popular English and Chinese smart speakers. To explain the causes underlying the FakeWake phenomena, we construct an interpretable tree-based decision model, which reveals phonetic features that contribute to false acceptance of fuzzy words by wake-up word detectors. Finally, we propose remedies to mitigate the effect of FakeWake. The results show that the strengthened models are not only resilient to fuzzy words but also achieve better overall performance on original training datasets.",

        "abstract": "Current computer systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks caused by the proliferation of accelerators, and the fact that current system comprise multiple SoCs provided from different vendors. Thus, major processor vendors are moving towards limiting the trust boundary to the processor chip only as in Intel's SGX, AMD's SME, and ARM's TrustZone. This secure boundary limitation requires protecting the memory content against data remanence attacks, which were performed against DRAM in the form of cold-boot attack and are more successful against NVM due to NVM's data persistency feature. However, implementing secure memory features, such as memory encryption and integrity verification has a non-trivial performance overhead, and can significantly reduce the emerging NVM's expected lifetime. Previous work looked at reducing the overheads of the secure memory implementation by packing more counters into a cache line, increasing the cacheability of security metadata, slightly reducing the size of the integrity tree, or using the ECC chip to store the MAC values. However, the root update process is barely studied, which requires a sequential update of the MAC values in all the integrity tree levels. In this paper, we propose ProMT, a novel memory controller design that ensures a persistently secure system with minimal overheads. ProMT protects the data confidentiality and ensures the data integrity with minimal overheads. ProMT reduces the performance overhead of secure memory implementation to 11.7%, extends the NVM's life time by 3.59x, and enables the system recovery in a fraction of a second.",

As this is a computationally heavy operation, resource-constrained devices benefit from a lower number of scalar multiplications. In this paper we present Julia Key Agreement (JKA), a protocol that satisfies the aforementioned security properties using two scalar multiplications, and thus saves both time and energy.

Then, the order of the measured messages is restored. Finally, security analysis and comparison with other protocols are carried out. The analysis result shows that the proposed protocol can transmit messages safely and efficiently, and its channel capacity is also high.",

It targets applications where low latency is key, such as cloud-based gaming, augmented reality, and connected cars. In these scenarios mobile users are often the norm, and services need to follow their users to continuously ensure the benefits of edge computing. Mobile edge computing addresses this demand, however, we identified three open challenges: First, edge computing facilities are sparse so far and achieving good connectivity requires a seamless transfer of workloads between different edge providers. Second, migration of edge services needs to be lightweight to make relocation transparent to users. Third, using geo-distributed edge resources of various providers demands for security measures to ensure service integrity and confidentiality.; B@We present E'dgedancer, a platform that offers infrastructure support for portable, provider-independent, and secure migration of edge services. E'dgedancer offers a lightweight and generic execution environment by utilising WebAssembly, which features an efficient, easy to transfer bytecode format. To make edge services self-migratable, and independent from the provider, E'dgedancer supports the notion of mobile agents offering weak and strong migration support. It utilises trusted execution to ensure the security of edge services during execution and migration. Finally, we shows that E'dgedancer features a lower migration time compared to previously proposed virtual machine migration while offering better security and platform independence.",

Since many of these applications are moving to the cloud environments, classical ML approaches are facing new challenges in accurately identifying abnormal behaviours due to the highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DistAppGaurd, for profiling simultaneously the behaviour of all microservice components of a distributed application in the cloud. The framework can therefore, detect complex attacks that are not observable by monitoring a single process or a single microservice. DistAppGaurd utilizes the system calls executed by all the processes of an application to build a graph consisting of data exchanges among different application entities (e.g., processes and files) representing the behaviour of the application. This representation is then used by our novel miroservice-aware Autoencoder model to perform anomaly detection at runtime. The efficiency and feasibility of our approach is shown by implementing several different real-world attacks, which yields high detection rates (94%-97%) at 0.01% false alarm rate.",

Our survey of 237 participants found that users do not understand that skills are often operated by third parties, that they often confuse third-party skills with native Alexa functions, and that they are unaware of the functions that the native Alexa system supports. Surprisingly, users who interact with Alexa more frequently are more likely to conclude that a third-party skill is a native Alexa function. The potential for misunderstanding creates new security and privacy risks: attackers can develop third-party skills that operate without users’ knowledge or masquerade as native Alexa functions. To mitigate this threat, we make design recommendations to help users better distinguish native functionality and third-party skills, including audio and visual indicators of native and third-party contexts, as well as a consistent design standard to help users learn what functions are and are not possible on Alexa.",

        "abstract": "As the demand for machine learning–based inference increases in tandem with concerns about privacy, there is a growing recognition of the need for secure machine learning, in which secret models can be used to classify private data without the model or data being leaked. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows arbitrary computation to be done over encrypted data, providing an attractive approach to providing such secure inference. While such computation is often orders of magnitude slower than its plaintext counterpart, the ability of FHE cryptosystems to do ciphertext packing—that is, encrypting an entire vector of plaintexts such that operations are evaluated elementwise on the vector—helps ameliorate this overhead, effectively creating a SIMD architecture where computation can be vectorized for more efficient evaluation. Most recent research in this area has targeted regular, easily vectorizable neural network models. Applying similar techniques to irregular ML models such as decision forests remains unexplored, due to their complex, hard-to-vectorize structures.  In this paper we present COPSE, the first system that exploits ciphertext packing to perform decision-forest inference. COPSE consists of a staging compiler that automatically restructures and compiles decision forest models down to a new set of vectorizable primitives for secure inference. We find that COPSE’s compiled models outperform the state of the art across a range of decision forest models, often by more than an order of magnitude, while still scaling well.",

        "abstract": "One of the most challenging problems in the field of intrusion detection is anomaly detection for discrete event logs. While most earlier work focused on applying unsupervised learning upon engineered features, most recent work has started to resolve this challenge by applying deep learning methodology to abstraction of discrete event entries. Inspired by natural language processing, LSTM-based anomaly detection models were proposed. They try to predict upcoming events, and raise an anomaly alert when a prediction fails to meet a certain criterion. However, such a predict-next-event methodology has a fundamental limitation: event predictions may not be able to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of sequences. This limitation leads to high false positives (FPs). It is also critical to examine the structure of sequences and the bi-directional causality among individual events. To this end, we propose a new methodology: Recomposing event sequences as anomaly detection. We propose DabLog, a LSTM-based Deep Autoencoder-Based anomaly detection method for discrete event Logs. The fundamental difference is that, rather than predicting upcoming events, our approach determines whether a sequence is normal or abnormal by analyzing (encoding) and reconstructing (decoding) the given sequence. Our evaluation results show that our new methodology can significantly reduce the numbers of FPs, hence achieving a higher F1 score.",

        "abstract": "Fear appeals have been used for thousands of years to scare people into engaging in a specific behavior or omitting an existing one. From religion, public health campaigns, political ads, and most recently, cybersecurity, fear appeals are believed to be effective tools. However, this assumption is often grounded in intuition rather than evidence. We know little about the specific contexts within which fear appeals may or may not work. In this study, we begin to examine various components of a fear appeal within the context of password hygiene. A large-scale randomized controlled experiment was conducted with one control and three treatment groups: (1) fear only; (2) measures needed and the efficacy of such measures, and (3) fear combined with measures needed and the efficacy of such measures. The results suggest that the most effective way to employ a fear appeal within the cybersecurity domain is by ensuring that fear is not used on its own. Instead, it is important that information on the measures needed to address the threat and the efficacy of such measures is used in combination with information about the nature of the threat. Since many individuals that enter the information technology profession become the de facto security person, it is important for information technology education programs to distill in students the inadequacy of fear, on its own, in motivating secure actions.",

This framework uses a task offloading decision model based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and is located on the user side to reduce the impact of network fluctuations. To improve the efficiency and security of the model in harsh edge computing environments, we adopt federated learning and introduce the blockchain into the process of parameter upload and decentralization of federated learning. In addition, we design a new blockchain consensus algorithm to reduce the waste of computing resources and improve the embedding and propagation speeds of the blockchain. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effect of task offloading of this model by performing offloading decisions on a simulation platform.",

As large numbers of IoT devices are deployed, the task will be simplified by combining the network connectivity, identity and certificate provisioning, and application-layer connectivity to one process. The solution will also allow the use of a one-time credential for the initial authentication, so that the long-term device certificate is issued automatically after the first connection to the network. The paper analyzes the requirements and architectural design options that implement such a user experience. We consider solutions that transfer short bootstrapping data inside the EAP session and then implement the provisioning and configuration with web APIs over HTTPS.

        "abstract": "Rust is an emerging programming language that aims at preventing memory-safety bugs without sacrificing much efficiency. The claimed property is very attractive to developers, and many projects start using the language. However, can Rust achieve the memory-safety promise? This article studies the question by surveying 186 real-world bug reports collected from several origins, which contain all existing Rust common vulnerability and exposures (CVEs) of memory-safety issues by 2020-12-31. We manually analyze each bug and extract their culprit patterns. Our analysis result shows that Rust can keep its promise that all memory-safety bugs require unsafe code, and many memory-safety bugs in our dataset are mild soundness issues that only leave a possibility to write memory-safety bugs without unsafe code. Furthermore, we summarize three typical categories of memory-safety bugs, including automatic memory reclaim, unsound function, and unsound generic or trait. While automatic memory claim bugs are related to the side effect of Rust newly-adopted ownership-based resource management scheme, unsound function reveals the essential challenge of Rust development for avoiding unsound code, and unsound generic or trait intensifies the risk of introducing unsoundness. Based on these findings, we propose two promising directions toward improving the security of Rust development, including several best practices of using specific APIs and methods to detect particular bugs involving unsafe code. Our work intends to raise more discussions regarding the memory-safety issues of Rust and facilitate the maturity of the language.",

Recent studies and reports have revealed that many of these devices suffer from crucial vulnerabilities that can be exploited with fatal consequences. Despite the security and safety-critical role of these devices, they often do not feature state-of-the-art security mechanisms. Moreover, since realtime systems have strict timing requirements, integrating new security mechanisms is not a viable option as they often influence the device's runtime behavior. One solution is to offload security enhancements to a remote instance, the so-called remote attestation. We present RealSWATT, the first software-based remote attestation system for realtime embedded devices. Remote attestation is a powerful security service that allows a party to verify the correct functionality of an untrusted remote device. In contrast to previous remote attestation approaches for realtime systems, RealSWATT does neither require custom hardware extensions nor trusted computing components. It is designed to work within real-world IoT networks, connected through Wi-Fi. RealSWATT leverages a dedicated processor core for remote attestation and provides the required timing guarantees without hardware extensions. We implement RealSWATT on the popular ESP32 microcontroller, and we evaluate it on a real-world medical device with realtime constraints. To demonstrate its applicability, we furthermore integrate RealSWATT into a framework for off-the-shelf IoT devices and apply it to a smart plug, a smoke detector, and a smart light bulb.",

That's to say, users have to expose their data to service providers in order to trade for Web services. Consequently, users lose control to their personal data, and undertake the hazard of data abuse and privacy leakage. Distributed resource sharing systems are dedicated to solving this problem, which typically face huge challenges in terms of access control mechanisms and data availability. Blockchain-based methods provide an effective solution, but mining consumes large computing power overhead and the accomplishment of access control mechanism is incomplete. In view of the above-mentioned challenges encountered in distributed resource sharing systems, we design a secure resource sharing architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric, and established a dedicated network and consensus mechanism to avoid unnecessary energy costs. We developed a fine-grained access control implementation plan for both acquisition and modification operations to flexibly realize the users’ unconditional control over personal data.

        "abstract": "Physical-layer based key generation schemes exploit the channel reciprocity for secret key extraction, which can achieve information-theoretic secrecy against eavesdroppers. Such methods, although practical, have been shown to be vulnerable against man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where an active adversary, Mallory, can influence and infer part of the secret key generated between Alice and Bob by injecting her own packet upon observing highly correlated channel/RSS measurements from Alice and Bob. As all the channels remain stable within the channel coherence time, Mallory's injected packets cause Alice and Bob to measure similar RSS, which allows Mallory to successfully predict the derived key bits. To defend against such a MitM attack, we propose to utilize a reconfigurable antenna at one of the legitimate transceivers to proactively randomize the channel state across different channel probing rounds. The randomization of the antenna mode at every probing round breaks the temporal correlation of the channels from the adversary to the legitimate devices, while preserving the reciprocity of the channel between the latter. This prevents key injection from the adversary without affecting Alice and Bob's ability to measure common randomness. We theoretically analyze the security of the protocol and conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate its performance. Our results show that our approach eliminates the advantage of an active MitM attack by driving down the probability of successfully guessing bits of the secret key to a random guess.",

        "abstract": "To reduce the development costs, IoT vendors tend to construct IoT kernels by customizing the Linux kernel. Code pruning is common in this customization process. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of the Linux kernel and the lack of long-term effective maintenance, IoT vendors may mistakenly delete necessary security operations in the pruning process, which leads to various bugs such as memory leakage and NULL pointer dereference. Yet detecting bugs caused by code pruning in IoT kernels is difficult. Specifically, (1) a significant structural change makes precisely locating the deleted security operations (DSO ) difficult, and (2) inferring the security impact of a DSO is not trivial since it requires complex semantic understanding, including the developing logic and the context of the corresponding IoT kernel. In this paper, we present CPscan, a system for automatically detecting bugs caused by code pruning in IoT kernels. First, using a new graph-based approach that iteratively conducts a structure-aware basic block matching, CPscan can precisely and efficiently identify theDSOs in IoT kernels. Then, CPscan infers the security impact of a DSO by comparing the bounded use chains (where and how a variable is used within potentially influenced code segments) of the security-critical variable associated with it. Specifically, CPscan reports the deletion of a security operation as vulnerable if the bounded use chain of the associated security-critical variable remains the same before and after the deletion. This is because the unchanged uses of a security-critical variable likely need the security operation, and removing it may have security impacts. The experimental results on 28 IoT kernels from 10 popular IoT vendors show that CPscan is able to identify 3,193DSO s and detect 114 new bugs with a reasonably low false-positive rate. Many such bugs tend to have a long latent period (up to 9 years and 5 months). We believe CPscan paves a way for eliminating the bugs introduced by code pruning in IoT kernels. We will open-source CPscan to facilitate further research.",

However, there is a lack of education and training materials on UAV cybersecurity, especially for hands-on practice. In this paper, we propose a novel UAV cybersecurity laboratory platform (UCLP), which provides efficient and effective hands-on practice. UCLP offers not only a cost-effective UAV cybersecurity practice environment, but also a series of designed and pre-configured lab modules. UCLP adopts a plug-in based design and hence supporting flexible customization of existing and new lab modules. UCLP uses technical solutions to overcome non-technical limitations in UAV cybersecurity practice (e.g., regulations of UAV operations). Our evaluation results demonstrated the efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness of UCLP and indicated UCLP is promising to be integrated into the education and training of UAV, cybersecurity, and related fields.",

Suitably constructed, e-Cash has the ability to offer an anonymous offline experience much akin to cash, and in direct contrast to traditional forms of payment such as credit and debit cards. Implementing security and privacy within e-Cash, i.e., preserving user anonymity while preventing counterfeiting, fraud, and double spending, is a non-trivial challenge. In this article, we propose major improvements to an e-Cash protocol, termed PUF-Cash, based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUF-Cash was created as an offline-first, secure e-Cash scheme that preserved user anonymity in payments. In addition, PUF-Cash supports remote payments; an improvement over traditional currency. In this work, a novel multi-trusted-third-party exchange scheme is introduced, which is responsible for “blinding” Alice’s e-Cash tokens; a feature at the heart of preserving her anonymity. The exchange operations are governed by machine learning techniques which are uniquely applied to optimize user privacy, while remaining resistant to identity-revealing attacks by adversaries and trusted authorities. Federation of the single trusted third party into multiple entities distributes the workload, thereby improving performance and resiliency within the e-Cash system architecture. Experimental results indicate that improvements to PUF-Cash enhance user privacy and scalability.",

This concept allows a client to prove its identity to a server via secret information while the server can learn nothing about the secret. Furthermore, we extend our protocol via secret sharing to support client multi-device authentication and multi-factor authentication features. In particular, the secret of the client can be distributed among the client’s devices.  The experimental analysis shows that our secret sharing AKA (SSAKA) can establish a secure communication channel in less than 600 ms for one secondary device and 128-bit security strength. The protocol is fast even on very constrained secondary devices, where in most of cases takes less than 500 ms.

Building upon this, we develop a taxonomy for hardware IFT. We use this to classify and differentiate hardware IFT tools and techniques. Finally, we discuss the challenges yet to be resolved.

A straightforward way to protect privacy is to encrypt the images using the standard cryptographic tools before outsourcing. However, in such a way the possible usage of the outsourced images would be strongly limited together with the services provided to users, like the Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). In this article, we propose a secure outsourced CBIR scheme, in which an encryption scheme is designed for the widely used JPEG-format images, and the secure features can be directly extracted from such encrypted images. Specifically, the JPEG images are encrypted by the block permutation, intra-block permutation, polyalphabetic cipher, and stream cipher. Then secure local histograms are extracted from the encrypted DCT blocks and the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) model is further used to organize the encrypted local features to represent the image. The proposed image encryption gets all of the image data protected and the experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves improved accuracy with a small file size expansion.",

        "abstract": "In the universal blind quantum computation problem, a client wants to make use of a single quantum server to evaluate C|0⟩ where C is an arbitrary quantum circuit while keeping C secret. The client’s goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS 2009], has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions). In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical — it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol’s first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter κ, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of κ, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of κ. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.",

        "abstract": "The wireless protocol WPA2 (Wi-Fi protected access version 2) personal, introduced in 2004, uses a passphrase, which in many cases is of low entropy, to authenticate clients and access points with each other. But the way the encryption keys derived from the passphrase are used makes it susceptible to offline dictionary attack using the captured handshake messages. This weakness has been handled in the protocol WPA3-personal, introduced in 2018, using a more secure protocol known as WPA3-SAE handshake, which essentially consists of Dragonfly handshake followed by WPA2 4-way handshake. However, in 2019, researchers pointed out that, for a specific pair of client and access point, the Dragonfly handshake uses a fixed number of iterations to find a generator of a prime order cyclic group from the passphrase. This information leads to timing leaks which can be used by an adversary to launch offline dictionary partitioning attack. To prevent this timing based offline dictionary attack, a constant number of iterations (which is fairly large) is used to get a generator of a prime order cyclic group using actual and dummy iterations for any pair of client and access point, but this may lead to cache based timing leaks. Besides, a large number of iterations results in high computation overhead which may lead to Denial of Service attacks. In this paper, we propose a Block Encryption based Password Authenticated Diffie-Hellman Key Establishment (BEPAKE) protocol to derive a high entropy shared secret between a client and an access point using the standard generator for the cyclic group under consideration. The BEPAKE protocol is then prepended to WPA3-SAE handshake protocol to design three modified WPA3-SAE handshake protocols, viz. BEPAKE-WPA3-M1, BEPAKE-WPA3-M2 and BEPAKE-WPA3-M3. The shared secret derived in the BEPAKE protocol is used to ensure that the adversary cannot launch any kind of timing based offline dictionary attack even if timing information to derive a generator of a group with correct passphrase is available to it. We give a detailed security analysis of the proposed protocols, and a comparison of their performance with that of WPA3-SAE handshake protocol using an experimental testbed.",

In this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage of recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In contrast with traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our attack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but not on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the ordered recommended items from a recommender system instead of prediction results in the form of posterior probabilities. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method by representing users from relevant items. Moreover, a shadow recommender is established to derive the labeled training data for training the attack model. Extensive experimental results show that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we design a defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the membership inference threat of recommender systems.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of publishing a stream of real-valued data satisfying differential privacy (DP). One major challenge is that the maximal possible value in the stream can be quite large, leading to enormous DP noise and bad utility. To reduce the maximal value and noise, one way is to estimate a threshold so that values above it can be truncated. The intuition is that, in many scenarios, only a few values are large; thus truncation does not change the original data much. We develop such a method that finds a suitable threshold with DP. Given the threshold, we then propose an online hierarchical method and several post-processing techniques. Building on these ideas, we formalize the steps in a framework for the private publishing of streaming data. Our framework consists of three components: a threshold optimizer that privately estimates the threshold, a perturber that adds calibrated noise to the stream, and a smoother that improves the result using post-processing. Within our framework, we also design an algorithm satisfying the more stringent DP setting called local DP. Using four real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art by a factor of $6-10$ orders of magnitude in terms of utility (measured by the mean squared error of the typical scenario of answering a random range query).",

        "abstract": "Despite the large investments in information security technologies and research over the past decades, the information security industry is still immature when it comes to vulnerability management. In particular, the prioritization of remediation efforts within vulnerability management programs predominantly relies on a mixture of subjective expert opinion and severity scores. Compounding the need for prioritization is the increase in the number of vulnerabilities the average enterprise has to remediate. This article describes the first open, data-driven framework for assessing vulnerability threat, that is, the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild within the first 12 months after public disclosure. This scoring system has been designed to be simple enough to be implemented by practitioners without specialized tools or software yet provides accurate estimates (ROC AUC = 0.838) of exploitation. Moreover, the implementation is flexible enough that it can be updated as more, and better, data becomes available. We call this system the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS).",

        "abstract": "Despite extensive testing and correctness certification of their functional semantics, a number of compiler optimizations have been shown to violate security guarantees implemented in source code. While prior work has shed light on how such optimizations may introduce semantic security weaknesses into programs, there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning the impacts of compiler optimizations on non-semantic properties with security implications. In particular, little is currently known about how code generation and optimization decisions made by the compiler affect the availability and utility of reusable code segments called gadgets required for implementing code reuse attack methods such as return-oriented programming.  In this paper, we bridge this gap through a study of the impacts of compiler optimization on code reuse gadget sets. We analyze and compare 1,187 variants of 20 different benchmark programs built with two production compilers (GCC and Clang) to determine how their optimization behaviors affect the code reuse gadget sets present in program variants with respect to both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Our study exposes an important and unexpected problem; compiler optimizations introduce new gadgets at a high rate and produce code containing gadget sets that are generally more useful to an attacker than those in unoptimized code. Using differential binary analysis, we identify several undesirable behaviors at the root of this phenomenon. In turn, we propose and evaluate several strategies to mitigate these behaviors. In particular, we show that post-production binary recompilation can effectively mitigate these behaviors with negligible performance impacts, resulting in optimized code with significantly smaller and less useful gadget sets.",

This paper proposes MISA, a new online approach to detect Trojan triggers for neural networks at inference time. Our approach is based on a novel notion called misattributions, which captures the anomalous manifestation of a Trojan activation in the feature space. Given an input image and the corresponding output prediction, our algorithm first computes the model’s attribution on different features. It then statistically analyzes these attributions to ascertain the presence of a Trojan trigger. Across a set of benchmarks, we show that our method can effectively detect Trojan triggers for a wide variety of trigger patterns, including several recent ones for which there are no known defenses. Our method achieves 96% AUC for detecting images that include a Trojan trigger without any assumptions on the trigger pattern.",

For instance, a ()-visual cryptography scheme (VCS) encrypts a secret image into shares and distributes them to different participants, the secret image can be recovered by at least shares. However, most of the existing VCSs are designed for binary images with limited flexibility and scalability. In this paper, a scalable ideal progressive visual cryptography scheme (PVCS) is proposed by scalable basis matrices and random Gaussian noise, which can process non-binarized images directly without pixel expansion. Our proposed basis matrix expansion method greatly improves the flexibility of the scheme and thus the efficiency is improved. In addition, since the visual effect of the VCS is standardized by the HVS and lacks an accurate quantitative index, we measure our scheme by using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity (SSIM), we also propose a method to derive the noise volume according to SSIM. Furthermore, sufficient experiments show that the proposed scheme is visually efficient and superior.",

These differences pose both operational risks (e.g. making dependent projects unable to compile) and security risks (e.g. deploying malicious code during package installation) in the software supply chain. Our empirical assessment of 2438 popular packages in PyPI with an analysis of around 10M lines of code shows several differences in the wild: modifications cannot be just attributed to malicious injections. Yet, scanning again all and whole ‘most likely good but modified’ packages is hard to manage for FOSS downstream users. We propose a methodology, LastPyMile, for identifying the differences between build artifacts of software packages and the respective source code repository.

The security of such services critically hinges on two aspects: (1) the connection configuration on the client-side; and (2) the TLS setup on the authentication servers. Weaknesses in either can leave users susceptible to credential theft. Typically, TEIs prescribe to their users either manual instructions or pre-configured profiles (e.g., eduroam CAT). For studying the security of configurations, we present a framework in which each configuration is mapped to an abstract security label drawn from a strict partially ordered set. We first used this framework to evaluate the configurations supported by the user interfaces (UIs) of mainstream operating systems (OSs), and discovered many design weaknesses. We then considered 7045 TEIs in 54 countries/regions, and collected 7275 configuration instructions from 2061 TEIs. Our analysis showed that majority of these instructions lead to insecure configurations, and nearly 86% of those TEIs can suffer from credential thefts on at least one OS. We also analyzed a large corpus of pre-configured eduroam CAT profiles and discovered several misconfiguration issues that can negatively impact security. Finally, we evaluated the TLS parameters used by authentication servers of thousands of TEIs and discovered perilous practices, such as the use of expired certificates, deprecated versions of TLS, weak signature algorithms, and suspected cases of private key reuse among TEIs. Our long list of findings have been responsibly disclosed to the relevant stakeholders, many of which have already been positively acknowledged.",

To overcome this limitation, we propose I Told You Tomorrow (ITYT), a novel way of implementing time-locked secrets based on smart contracts. ITYT relies on the blockchain to measure the elapse of time, and it combines threshold cryptography with economic incentives and penalties to replace cryptographic puzzles.  We implement a prototype of ITYT on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The prototype leverages secure Multi-Party Computation to avoid any single point of trust. We also analyze resiliency to attacks with the help of economic game theory, in the context of rational adversaries.

In this paper, we present a VSA privacy enhancement system (PECAM), which addresses the above challenge with no change in the VSA back-end. PECAM leverages a novel Generative Adversarial Network to perform the privacy-enhanced securely-reversible video transformation. PECAM also incorporates a couple of system optimizations into its VSA workflow to reduce network bandwidth usage and enable real-time processing on cameras. We implement our PECAM prototype on commodity hardware and evaluate its performance via both security study and extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that PECAM can effectively enhance the visual privacy of VSA in the presence of an adversary, and its transformed videos, when taken as input for various VSA back-end tasks, maintain a 96% accuracy of corresponding original videos. Additionally, it performs 12.3× and 1.8× better than baseline methods in terms of the computing cost and network bandwidth usage, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Some recent studies have found that there are some side-channel vulnerabilities in the operating system. Attackers would exploit the side-channel vulnerability for malicious purpose, such as hijack connections, denial of service attacks, etc. Currently, most attacks are detected manually. In this paper, we found that the reason for the existence of network protocol side-channel vulnerability is the use of shared resources. Since the state of shared resource affects all connections, when a connection uses a shared resource, information about that connection can be inferred by observing the usage of the shared resource. In order to find the shared resources, we implemented a tool called TASR which is a method of static analysis. The first is to find out what shared resources are available by the definition of shared resources in static analysis. Then, the data packet is used as the taint source to search the tainted shared resources. The second step is to analyze the taint-transmission-path according to the acquired tainted shared variable. Then it can find the side-channel vulnerability. By using this method on TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols, we find the following four shared variables: challenge_count, tcp_memory_allocated, tcp_memory_pressure, sysctl_icmp_msg_per_sec. It is difficult for tcp_memory allocated and tcp_memory pressure to exploit, because they will go through multiple strict checks. Using challenge_count can hijack the connection and inject malicious packets. Using sysctl_icmp_msg_per_sec can assist in DNS cache poisoning attack.",

        "abstract": "The existing Bitcoin security research has mainly followed the security models in [22, 35], which stipulate that an adversary controls some mining power in order to violate the blockchain consistency property (i.e., through a double-spend attack). These models, however, largely overlooked the impact of the realistic network synchronization, which can be manipulated given the permissionless nature of the network. In this paper, we revisit the security of Bitcoin blockchain by incorporating the network synchronization into the security model and evaluating that in practice. Towards this goal, we propose the ideal functionality for the Bitcoin network synchronization and specify bounds on the network outdegree and the block propagation delay in order to preserve the consistency property. By contrasting the ideal functionality against measurements, we find deteriorating network synchronization reported by Bitnodes and a notable churn rate with 10% of the nodes arriving and departing from the network daily. Motivated by these findings, we propose SyncAttack, an attack that allows an adversary to violate the Bitcoin blockchain consistency property and double-spend without using any mining power. Moreover, during our measurements, we discover weaknesses in Bitcoin that can be exploited to reduce the cost of SyncAttack, deanonymize Bitcoin transactions, and reduce the effective network hash rate. We also observe events that suggest malicious nodes are exploiting those weaknesses in the network. Finally, we patch those weaknesses to mitigate SyncAttack and associated risks.",

In recent years, Short Message Service (SMS) has been revealed as a new distribution channel for spearphishing messages, which already has caused a serious impact in the real world, but has not yet attracted enough attention from the academic community. In this paper, we report the first systemic study to spotlight this emerging threat, SMS spearphishing attack. Through cooperating with a leading security vendor, we obtain 31.96M real-world spam messages that span three months. We design and implement a novel NLP-based detection algorithm, and uncover 90,801 spearphishing messages on the entire dataset. And then, a large-scale measurement was performed on the detected messages to reveal and understand the characteristics of SMS spearphishing attack. Our findings are multi-fold. We discover that SMS spearphishing has a significant negative impact on the real-world, and a large number of victims have been affected. And the distribution of active illicit types between spearphishing message and common spam is quite inconsistent. At the micro-level, to evade detection and increase the probability of success, adversary campaigns have evolved a set of sophisticated strategies. Our research highlights the impact of SMS spearphishing attack is prominent. We call on different communities to work together to mitigate this emerging security threat.",

In such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time (τ) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large τ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale τ/I ≈1 in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in parallel to ASIC mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to ζ blocks, where ζ is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay Δ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale τ without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling up of τ/I in existing blockchains",

We conduct large-scale experiments on 1,229 vulnerability-contributing commits containing 542 different SVs in 246 real-world software projects to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model. We show that DeepCVA is the best-performing model with 38% to 59.8% higher Matthews Correlation Coefficient than many supervised and unsupervised baseline models. DeepCVA also requires 6.3 times less training and validation time than seven cumulative assessment models, leading to significantly less model maintenance cost as well.

Prior RA techniques verify the remote device's binary at the time when RA functionality is executed, thus providing no information about the device's binary before current RA execution or between consecutive RA executions. This implies that presence of transient malware (in the form of modified binary) may be undetected. In other words, if transient malware infects a device (by modifying its binary), performs its nefarious tasks, and erases itself before the next attestation, its temporary presence will not be detected. This important problem, called Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use ( TOCTOU ), is well-known in the research literature and remains unaddressed in the context of hybrid RA. In this work, we propose Remote Attestation with TOCTOU Avoidance (RATA): a provably secure approach to address the RA TOCTOU problem. With RATA, even malware that erases itself before execution of the next RA, can not hide its ephemeral presence. RATA targets hybrid RA architectures, which are aimed at low-end embedded devices. We present two alternative techniques - RATA A and RATA B - suitable for devices with and without real-time clocks, respectively. Each is shown to be secure and accompanied by a publicly available and formally verified implementation. Our evaluation demonstrates low hardware overhead of both techniques. Compared with current hybrid RA architectures - that offer no TOCTOU protection - RATA incurs no extra runtime overhead. In fact, it substantially reduces the time complexity of RA computations: from linear to constant time.",

However, the thermo-optic effects of the photonic devices have a great impact on the operating performance and reliability of ONoCs, where the thermal-aware control with accurate measurements, e.g., thermal sensing, is typically applied to alleviate it. Besides, the temperature-sensitive ONoCs are prone to be attacked by the hardware Trojans (HTs) covertly embedded in the counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) from the malicious third-party vendors, leading to performance degradation, denial-of-service (DoS), or even permanent damages. In this article, we focus on the tampering and snooping attacks during the thermal sensing via micro-ring resonator (MR) in ONoCs. Based on the provided workflow and attack model, a new structure of the anti-HT module is proposed to verify and protect the obtained data from the thermal sensor for attacks in its optical sampling and electronic transmission processes. In addition, we present the detection scheme based on the spiking neural networks (SNNs) to implement an accurate classification of the network security statuses for further high-level control. Evaluation results indicate that, with less than 1% extra area of a tile, our approach can significantly enhance the hardware security of thermal sensing for ONoC with trivial costs of up to 8.73%, 5.32%, and 6.14% in average latency, execution time, and energy consumption, respectively.",

To treat this requirement, we proposed the scheme [1] enabling vehicles to evaluate the credibility and the accuracy of the contents of the safety messages exchanged in VANETs. That scheme is based on three modules: a reputation module, a time and location closeness estimation module, and a majority module. A vehicle can use these modules in a separated or joint way according to the circumstances. Since that scheme is error prone, we conducted in [2], a formal validation, using inference system, to prove the soundness and the completeness of these three modules and their combination. In this paper, we complete that formal validation of [1] by handling the junctions of the three basic modules two by two. To do this, we first completed the inference system in [2] so that the junctions of the three modules two by two become incorporated. A formal verification using this holistic inference system was proposed in a second step to prove the soundness and the completeness of these junctions. This verification's obtained results confirmed the validity of the said junctions for being sound and complete.",

This research study reviews the perceptions of using MCC on teachers, parents, and students during the covid-19 lockdowns period in Jordan. The objectives of the research are to study the educational environment from the MCC user’s viewpoint, the difficulties that the users face while using MCC in learning, and their concerns about using MCC since it becomes an inevitable solution. Moreover, this research highlights the extent to which users know and accept MCC that they use and its effects on their privacy. Questionnaire results concluded that over 60 % of the users used social media and over 50collaborative applications as a communication method through their smart mobile devices compared to users who relied on specialized e-learning educational platforms, computers, or televisions. About 50 % of the users agreed to learn MCC techniques if it is required especially if they have the opportunity to see someone using these techniques in front of them, although near 35 % of the users thought that MCC threats their privacy. Over 65 % of the users determined the most difficulty or fear is disconnecting communication, especially while performing online exams.

However, digital signatures often rely on expensive operations that can be highly costly for low-end devices, typically seen in the Internet of Things and Systems (IoTs). These efficiency concerns especially deepen when post-quantum secure digital signatures are considered. Hence, it is of vital importance to devise post-quantum secure digital signatures that are designed with the needs of such constraint IoT systems in mind.  In this work, we propose a novel lightweight post-quantum digital signature that respects the processing, memory, and bandwidth limitations of resource-limited IoTs. Our new scheme, called , efficiently transforms a one-time signature to a (polynomially-bounded) many-time signature via a distributed public key computation method. This new approach enables a resource-limited signer to compute signatures without any costly lattice operations (e.g., rejection samplings, matrix multiplications, etc.), and only with a low-memory footprint and compact signature sizes. We also developed a variant for  with forward-security, which is an extremely costly property to attain via the state-of-the-art post-quantum signatures.",

Nowadays, a multitude of protocols and computer models are appearing along with new attacks increasing the need to develop solutions. This work focuses on the protection of the agent as well as the information it processes in a distributed environment throughout the network. Mobile agents move between various network-enabled platforms to process the information they manage. To simulate an environment based on the Internet of Things (IoT), a scheme has been presented which details the necessary steps to be carried out by the agent to perform the migration.  Today it was proved that there is no infallible solution that guarantees the security of the whole system. However, the importance of security mechanisms to reduce and/or mitigate security threats is fundamental. This work is a study based on a mobile agent-based approach that travels from host to host. A review of different threats to this particular model is presented. Throughout this work a detailed study is presented based on the migration protocol of the agents, which will be determined by using modeling tools such as Microsoft Modeling Tool (MMT) used in this case, to discover and detail each of the threats presented by this protocol. Additionally, an alternative as a solution according to a protocol that runs thanks to the implementation of hardware elements is proposed, which makes use of a TPM, thus determining which threats are mitigated or solved by implementing such hardware in conjunction with the protocol developed for this purpose.",

However, on-device certificate verification is challenging for current devices, mainly because the certificate revocation (CR) checking step costs too much resource on IoT devices and the synchronization of CR status to devices yields a long latency. This paper presents an on-device CR checking system called TinyCR, which achieves 100% accuracy, memory and computation efficiency, low synchronization latency, and low network bandwidth, while being compatible with the current certificate standard. We design a new compact and dynamic data structure called DASS to store and query global CR status on a device in TinyCR. Our implementation shows that TinyCR only costs each device 1.7 MB of memory to track 100 million IoT certificates with 1% revocation rate. Checking the CR status of one certificate spends less than 1 microsecond on a Raspberry Pi 3. TinyCR can also be updated instantly when there are new certificates added or revoked.",

It naturally occurs in many real-world scenarios: For instance, geographic locations (approximately) lie on a sphere, and periodic data such as time of day, or day of week can be interpreted as points on a circle. Massive amounts of directional data are collected by location-based service platforms such as Google Maps or Foursquare, who depend on mobility data from users' smartphones or wearable devices to enable their analytics and marketing businesses. However, such data is often highly privacy-sensitive and hence demands measures to protect the privacy of the individuals whose data is collected and processed. Starting with the von Mises-Fisher distribution, we therefore propose and analyze two novel privacy mechanisms for directional data by combining directional statistics with differential privacy, which presents the current state-of-the-art for quantifying and limiting information disclosure about individuals. As we will see, our specialized privacy mechanisms achieve a better privacy-utility trade-off than ex post adaptions of established mechanisms to directional data.",

        "abstract": "RFID is a smart label technology that is used in several real-life applications such as inventory management, asset tracking, personnel tracking, controlling access to restricted areas, ID badging, supply chain management, counterfeit prevention (e.g., in the pharmaceutical industry), and smart farming. Generally, the data collection of RFIDs consists of the users’ visited locations and their visiting time, so called as trajectory datasets. Aside from applications, trajectory datasets can also be released for public use. For this reason, they could lead to being privacy violation issues. To address these issues in trajectory datasets, LKC-Privacy is proposed. Unfortunately, in this work, we demonstrate that LKC-Privacy still has a serious vulnerability that must be improved. To rid the demonstrated vulnerability of LKC-Privacy, a privacy preservation model is proposed in this work. Furthermore, the proposed mode is evaluated by extensive experiments. From the experimental results, they indicate that the proposed model is highly secure and more efficient than LKC-Privacy.",

As process automation and robotics keep evolving, sensing methods such as pressure sensing are extensively used in both conventional systems and rapidly emerging applications. The goal of this paper is to investigate the threats and design a low-complexity defense method against EMI injection attacks on sensors. To ensure the security and usability of sensors and automated processes, we propose to leverage a matched dummy sensor circuit that shares the sensor's vulnerabilities to EMI but is insensitive to legitimate signals that the sensor is intended to measure. Our method can detect and correct corrupted sensor measurements without introducing components or modules that are highly complex compared to an original low-end sensor circuit. We analyze and evaluate our method on sensors with EMI injection experiments using different attack parameters. We investigate several attack scenarios, including manipulating the DC voltage of the sensor output, injecting sinusoidal signals, white noises, and malicious voice signals. Our experimental results suggest that, with relatively low cost and computation overhead, the proposed method not only detects the attack but also can correct corrupted sensor data to help maintain the functioning of systems based on different kinds of sensors in the presence of attacks.",

Our method makes use of sample databases to prune the generated candidate motifs to lower the magnitude of added noise.

        "abstract": "Machine learning models are now widely deployed in real-world applications. However, the existence of adversarial examples has been long considered a real threat to such models. While numerous defenses aiming to improve the robustness have been proposed, many have been shown ineffective. As these vulnerabilities are still nowhere near being eliminated, we propose an alternative deployment-based defense paradigm that goes beyond the traditional white-box and black-box threat models. Instead of training and deploying a single partially-robust model, one could train a set of same-functionality, yet, adversarially-disjoint models with minimal in-between attack transferability. These models could then be randomly and individually deployed, such that accessing one of them minimally affects the others. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and a wide range of attacks show that we achieve a significantly lower attack transferability across our disjoint models compared to a baseline of ensemble diversity. In addition, compared to an adversarially trained set, we achieve a higher average robust accuracy while maintaining the accuracy of clean examples.",

To close this gap, we present a large-scale study with over 800 participants. Based on it, we show that it is possible to predict whether users are truthful or not using machine learning with very high accuracy (89.7%). We also identify four main strategies people employ to provide untruthful data and show the factors that influence the choices of their strategies. We discuss the implications of findings and argue that understanding privacy lies at this level can help both users and data collectors.",

At the heart of our optimization is a well-chosen subgroup of the underlying , which is used as the randomness space for masking messages during encryption. The size of the subgroup is significantly smaller than that of , leading to faster encryption and decryption algorithms of our optimization.     We establish the one-wayness and semantic security of our optimized Paillier scheme upon those of an optimization (i.e., “Scheme 3”) made by Paillier in Eurocrypt’99. Thus, our optimized scheme is one-way under the partial discrete logarithm (PDL) assumption, and is semantically secure under the decisional PDL (DPDL) assumption. On the other hand, we present a detailed analysis on the concrete security of our optimized scheme under several known methods. To provide 112-bit security, our analysis suggests that a 2048-bit modulus N and a well-chosen subgroup of size 448-bit would suffice. We compare our optimization with existing optimized Paillier schemes, including the Jurik’s optimization proposed by Jurik in his Ph.D. thesis and the Paillier’s optimization in Eurocrypt’99. Our experiments show that, – the encryption of our optimization is about 2.7 times faster than that of the Jurik’s optimization and is about 7.5 times faster than that of the Paillier’s optimization;  – the decryption of our optimization is about 4.1 times faster than that of the Jurik’s optimization and has a similar performance with that of the Paillier’s optimization.",

These alerts include AMBER alerts, severe weather alerts, and (unblockable) Presidential Alerts, intended to inform the public of imminent threats. Recently, a test Presidential Alert was sent to all capable phones in the U.S., prompting concerns about how the underlying WEA protocol could be misused or attacked. In this paper, we investigate the details of this system and develop and demonstrate the first practical spoofing attack on Presidential Alerts, using commercially available hardware and modified open source software. Our attack can be performed using a commercially available software-defined radio, and our modifications to the open source software libraries. We find that with only four malicious portable base stations of a single Watt of transmit power each, almost all of a 50,000-seat stadium can be attacked with a 90% success rate. The real impact of such an attack would, of course, depend on the density of cellphones in range; fake alerts in crowded cities or stadiums could potentially result in cascades of panic. Fixing this problem will require a large collaborative effort between carriers, government stakeholders, and cellphone manufacturers. To seed this effort, we also propose three mitigation solutions to address this threat.",

We believe a similar idea carries over into other critical areas as well, such as understanding the perils of social networks and machine learning.  Objectives. What kinds of at can we expect of early post-secondary computing students? In particular, can they meaningfully analyze computing systems that are well beyond their technical ken? Is their analysis limited to only a social or only a technical space?  Method. In an introductory post-secondary course, we study student responses to questions designed to exercise at, broadly defined. To do this we develop a rubric that provides insight into desirable content.  Results. We find that these students are fairly strong at at. They are regularly able to adopt an adversarial or empathetic viewpoint and analyze quite sophisticated systems. Most of all, they can meaningfully do so (a) outside an explicit cybersecurity context, (b) even from an introductory level, and (c) well before they understand well the key technologies under evaluation.  On the other hand, we also find several instances where students do not explore systems as much as they could, and fail to reference other material they know, which could be evidence of lack of transfer. In addition, our rubric would benefit from refinement that would enable a more sophisticated analysis of student responses.  Discussion. Our work provides a baseline evaluation of what we can expect from students. It suggests that at can be introduced early in the curriculum, and in contexts outside computer security.",

This architecture creates domains governed by a secured trust schema provided to every device during its enrollment together with the device's attribute-based signing cert chain(s). Applications don't need to be rewritten to gain security; a run-time library with an MQTT-like publish/subscribe API uses the provisioned trust schema and certs to construct, sign and ship outgoing publications and to both cryptographically and structurally validate a subscriber's incoming publications. This unique application of trust schemas (Versec) is explained and an example home IoT framework is described where trust schemas express straightforward, homeowner-specific policies that an open-source library enforces at run-time on behalf of security-agnostic applications. Along with the specific innovation in trust management, the platform exploits current and emergent IoT best practices.

In order to solve the problem that existing user desensitised data generation methods lead to the unavailability of the user profile analysis function of applications, this paper proposes a generative adversarial network-based algorithm for generating user privacy desensitised data, which improves the usability of the data while ensuring data privacy. The algorithm is based on generative adversarial networks, using a differential autoencoder to extract user data features and migrate the features to the desensitised data; it also uses a multi-headed attention mechanism to intensively extract the main features of the user data; in order to ensure that the desensitised data can be used for the Android app's own user portrait analysis, its discriminator uses the app's own neural network learning model to adjust the output of the generator. Due to the stochastic nature of the differential auto-encoder learning process and the approximation process, the desensitised data are independent of the user's original data, thus protecting the user's private data. The desensitised data are guided by the discriminator with the characteristics of the original data, and the results of user profiling based on this desensitised data are approximately the same as the results of the original data analysis, which protects user privacy without compromising profiling.",

Taking advantage of the tradeoff between computing efficiency and flexibility of FPGA, we develop FastCFI, an FPGA-based CFI system that can perform fine-grained and stateful checking without code instrumentation. We also propose an automated Verilog generation technique that facilitates fast deployment of FastCFI, and a compression algorithm for reducing the hardware expense. Experiments on popular benchmarks confirm that FastCFI can detect fine-grained CFI violations over unmodified binaries. When using FastCFI on prevalent benchmarks, we demonstrate its capability to detect fine-grained CFI violations in unmodified binaries, while incurring an average of 0.36% overhead and a maximum of 2.93% overhead.",

Network Discovery Protocol (NDP) is an important protocol in IPv6 to identify the relationships between different neighboring devices in a network. However, it is also subject to spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. This paper implements an attack detection and mitigation strategy called Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) in P4 to defend IPv6 networks against router spoofing attacks directly on the data plane. In contrast to very few proprietary RA-Guard implementations with limited details, we consider different scenarios to exploit IPv6 packet structure and publish our implementation open-source.

        "abstract": "The IPv6 protocol will sooner or later replace IPv4 to cope with an exponentially increasing number of connected devices. Some of the most significant functions of IPv6 networks are network discovery, maintenance, and routing mechanisms to promote auto-configuration of the network with less manual effort. Network Discovery Protocol (NDP) is an important protocol in IPv6 to identify the relationships between different neighboring devices in a network. However, it is also subject to spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. This paper implements an attack detection and mitigation strategy called Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) in P4 to defend IPv6 networks against router spoofing attacks directly on the data plane. In contrast to very few proprietary RA-Guard implementations with limited details, we consider different scenarios to exploit IPv6 packet structure and publish our implementation open-source. The experiments show that our P4-based implementation can detect and mitigate spoofing attacks leveraging RA-Guard together with its control plane extensions.",

        "abstract": "In order to create user-centric and personalized privacy management tools, the underlying models must account for individual users’ privacy expectations, preferences, and their ability to control their information sharing activities. Existing studies of users’ privacy behavior modeling attempt to frame the problem from a request’s perspective, which lack the crucial involvement of the information owner, resulting in limited or no control of policy management. Moreover, very few of them take into the consideration the aspect of correctness, explainability, usability, and acceptance of the methodologies for each user of the system. In this paper, we present a methodology to formally model, validate, and verify personalized privacy disclosure behavior based on the analysis of the user’s situational decision-making process. We use a model checking tool named UPPAAL to represent users’ self-reported privacy disclosure behavior by an extended form of finite state automata (FSA), and perform reachability analysis for the verification of privacy properties through computation tree logic (CTL) formulas. We also describe the practical use cases of the methodology depicting the potential of formal technique towards the design and development of user-centric behavioral modeling. This paper, through extensive amounts of experimental outcomes, contributes several insights to the area of formal methods and user-tailored privacy behavior modeling.",

        "abstract": "Wearable and implantable medical devices are being increasingly deployed for diagnosis, monitoring, and to provide therapy for critical medical conditions. Such medical devices are examples of safety-critical, cyber-physical systems. In this paper we focus on insulin infusion systems (IISs), which are used by diabetics to maintain safe blood glucose levels. These systems support wireless features introducing potential vulnerabilities. Although these devices go through rigorous safety certification processes, these are not able to mitigate security threats. Based on published literature, attackers can remotely command to inject an incorrect amount of insulin thereby posing threat to a patient's life. While prior work based on formal methods have been proposed to detect potential attack vectors using different forms of static analysis, these have limitations in preventing attacks at run-time. Also, as these devices are safety critical, it is not possible to apply security patches, when new types of attacks are detected, due to the need for recertification. This paper addresses these limitations by developing a formal framework for the detection of cyber-physical attacks on an IIS. First, we propose a wearable device that senses the familiar ECG to detect attacks. Thus, this device is separate from the insulin infusion system, ensuring no need for recertification of IISs. To facilitate the design of this device, we establish a correlation of ECG intervals and blood glucose levels using statistical analysis. This helps us in proposing a framework for security policy mining using the developed statistical analysis. This paves the way for the design of formal verification monitors for IISs for the first time. We perform performance evaluation of the verification monitor, which proves the technical feasibility for the design of wearable devices for attack detection of IISs. Our approach is amenable to the application of security patches, when new attack vectors are detected, making the approach ideal for run-time monitoring of medical CPSs.",

Anti-malware are not able to detect zero-day malware, because to detect malicious behaviour they need to know its signature, but to have this information the malware must already be widespread. Furthermore, anti-malware are able to scan one application at a time: for this reason a type of malware characterized by the colluding attack, where the malicious action is split in two (or more) applications, can not be recognised.  To demonstrate the ineffectiveness of current anti-malware mechanisms in recognizing colluding attacks, in this paper we propose SteælErgon, a framework aimed to inject a malicious payload in two or more different Android applications. Clearly the malicious payload will be executed once all the applications composing the collusive attacks are installed into the infected device.  In detail, SteælErgon is able to inject a collusive malicious payload attacking the external storage, allowing the attacker to catch sensitive and private information stored into the infected device. We perform an experimental analysis by submitting the generated colluding application to different 79 anti-malware, by showing that current detection mechanism are not able to detect this kind of threat.

SCALPEL allows a designer to explore high-quality points in the privilege-reduction vs. performance overhead tradeoff space using analysis tools and a detailed knowledge of the target architecture to make best use of the available hardware. SCALPEL automatically implements hundreds of compartmentalization strategies across the privilege-performance tradeoff space, all without manual tagging or code restructuring. SCALPEL uses two novel optimizations for achieving highly performant policies: the first is an algorithm for packing policies into working sets of rules for favorable rule cache characteristics, and the second is a rule prefetching system that allows it to exploit the highly predictable nature of compartmentalization rules. To create policies, SCALPEL introduces a quantitative privilege metric (the Overprivilege Ratio) that is used to drive its algorithmic compartment generation. We implement SCALPEL on a FreeRTOS stack and target a tag-extended RISC-V core. Our results show that SCALPEL-created policies can reduce overprivilege by orders of magnitude with hundreds of logical compartments while imposing low overheads (<5%).",

Especially in the context of websites, we often find pages that were forgotten, that is, they were left online after they served their purpose and never updated thereafter. In this paper, we introduce new methodology to detect such forgotten or orphaned web pages. We combine historic data from the Internet Archive with active measurements to identify pages no longer reachable via a path from the index page, yet stay accessible through their specific URL. We show the efficacy of our approach and the real-world relevance of orphaned web-pages by applying it to a sample of 100,000 domains from the Tranco Top 1M. Leveraging our methodology, we find 1,953 pages on 907 unique domains that are orphaned, some of which are 20 years old. Analyzing their security posture, we find that these pages are significantly ((p < 0.01) using (χ2)) more likely to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities than maintained pages. In fact, orphaned pages are almost ten times as likely to suffer from XSS (19.3%) than maintained pages from a random Internet crawl (2.0%), and maintained pages of websites with some orphans are almost three times as vulnerable (5.9%). Concerning SQLi, maintained pages on websites with some orphans are almost as vulnerable (9.5%) as orphans (10.8%), and both are significantly more likely to be vulnerable than other maintained pages (2.7%). Overall, we see a clear hierarchy: Orphaned pages are the most vulnerable, followed by maintained pages on websites with orphans, with fully maintained sites being least vulnerable. We share an open source implementation of our methodology to enable the reproduction and application of our results in practice.",

Therefore, violating the blockchain safety requires strong adversaries that control a mining pool with 51% hash rate. In this paper, we show that the network synchrony does not hold in the real world Bitcoin network which can be exploited to lower the cost of various attacks that violate the blockchain safety and chain quality. Towards that, first we construct the Bitcoin ideal functionality to formally specify its ideal execution model in a synchronous network. We then develop a large-scale data collection system through which we connect with more than 36K IP addresses of the Bitcoin nodes and identify 359 mining nodes. We contrast the ideal functionality against the real world measurements to expose the network anomalies that can be exploited to optimize the existing attacks. Particularly, we observe a non-uniform block propagation pattern among the mining nodes showing that the Bitcoin network is asynchronous in practice. To realize the threat of an asynchronous network, we present the HashSplit attack that allows an adversary to orchestrate concurrent mining on multiple branches of the blockchain to violate common prefix and chain quality properties. We also propose the attack countermeasures by tweaking Bitcoin Core to model the Bitcoin ideal functionality. Our measurements, theoretical modeling, proposed attack, and countermeasures open new directions in the security evaluation of Bitcoin and similar blockchain systems.",

In this research, we investigated how much of the alerts issued by different security devices installed on the same network can be considered duplicates or unique. We obtained the alert data for an organization with multiple appliances for a period of 10 months and extracted all the sets of alerts that could be inferred to refer to the same event to analyze the extent to which the alert types that they generate co-occur across the appliances. According to the analysis of the similarity between alert types based on their co-occurrence, we mapped the alert types in 2 dimensions to discuss the appliances’ correlation. We observed that some appliances completely overlap with the alerting behaviors of other appliances and identified appliances that produce many useful alerts with high uniqueness.",

        "abstract": "In the near future IoT will be part of every home turning our houses into smart houses, in which we have multiple users with complex social relationships between them using the same smart devices. This requires sophisticated access control specification and enforcement models. Recently, several access control models have been developed or adapted for IoT in general, with a few specifically designed for the smart home IoT domain. The majority of these models are built on role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) models which have had considerable traction in traditional non-IoT domains. In this paper, we introduce the smart home IoT attribute-based access control model (HABAC). HABAC is a dynamic and fine-grained model that is developed specifically to meet smart home IoT challenges. Currently it is not precisely clear what are the pros and cons of ABAC over RBAC in general, and in smart home IoT in particular. To this end we provide an analysis of HABAC relative to the previously published EGRBAC (extended generalized role based access control) model for smart home IoT. We compare the theoretical expressive power of these models by providing algorithms for converting an HABAC specification to EGRBAC and vice versa, and discuss the insights for practical deployment of these models resulting from these constructions. We conclude that a hybrid model combining ABAC and RBAC features may be the most suitable for smart home IoT, and likely more generally.",

Further, we identify the similarities in terms of the Contextual Integrity parameters of the privacy norms studied to distill more general privacy norms, which could be useful, for instance, to establish suitable privacy defaults in SPA.

The core functionality of Rushmore is to securely decrypt and display encrypted images (sent by a trusted party) on a mobile device. Although previous approaches have shown that it is possible to securely display encrypted images using TrustZone, they exhibit a critical limitation that significantly hampers the applicability of using TrustZone for display security. The limitation is that, when the trusted domain of TrustZone (the secure world) takes control of the display, the untrusted domain (the normal world) cannot display anything simultaneously. This limitation comes from the fact that previous approaches give the secure world exclusive access to the display hardware to preserve security. With Rushmore, we overcome this limitation by leveraging a well-known, yet overlooked hardware feature called an IPU (Image Processing Unit) that provides multiple display channels. By partitioning these channels across the normal world and the secure world, we enable the two worlds to simultaneously display pixels on the screen without sacrificing security. Furthermore, we show that with the right type of cryptographic method, we can decrypt and display encrypted animated images at 30 FPS or higher for medium-to-small images and at around 30 FPS for large images. One notable cryptographic method we adapt for Rushmore is visual cryptography, and we demonstrate that it is a light-weight alternative to other cryptographic methods for certain use cases. Our evaluation shows that in addition to providing usable frame rates, Rushmore incurs less than 5% overhead to the applications running in the normal world.",

This advancement also gave birth to the idea of the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT). The IoBT refers to the fusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) with military operations on the battlefield. Various IoBT-based frameworks have been developed for the military. Nonetheless, many of these frameworks fail to maintain a high Quality of Service (QoS) due to the demanding and critical nature of IoBT. This study makes the use of mist computing while leveraging machine learning. Mist computing places computational capabilities on the edge itself (mist nodes), e.g., on end devices, wearables, sensors, and micro-controllers. This way, mist computing not only decreases latency but also saves power consumption and bandwidth as well by eliminating the need to communicate all data acquired, produced, or sensed. A mist-based version of the IoTNetWar framework is also proposed in this study. The mist-based IoTNetWar framework is a four-layer structure that aims at decreasing latency while maintaining QoS. Additionally, to further minimize delays, mist nodes utilize machine learning. Specifically, they use the delay-based K nearest neighbour algorithm for device-to-device communication purposes. The primary research objective of this work is to develop a system that is not only energy, time, and bandwidth-efficient, but it also helps military organizations with time-critical and resources-critical scenarios to monitor troops. By doing so, the system improves the overall decision-making process in a military campaign or battle. The proposed work is evaluated with the help of simulations in the EdgeCloudSim. The obtained results indicate that the proposed framework can achieve decreased network latency of 0.01 s and failure rate of 0.25% on average while maintaining high QoS in comparison to existing solutions.",

In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of custom Android Residuals to understand whether they may lead to access control vulnerabilities. Our investigation is driven by the intuition that it is challenging for vendor developers to ensure proper protection of Residuals. Since they are deemed unnecessary, Residuals are naturally overlooked during integration and maintenance. This is particularly exacerbated by the complexities of Android's ever-evolving access control mechanism. To facilitate the study at large, we propose a set of analysis techniques that detect and evaluate Residuals' access control enforcement. Our techniques feature a synergy between application and framework program analysis to recognize potential Residuals in specially curated ROM samples. The Residual implementations are then statically analyzed to detect potential evolution-induced access control vulnerabilities. Our study reveals that Residuals are prevalent among OEMs. More importantly, we find that their presence may even lead to security-critical vulnerabilities.",

In order to effectively identify and analyse personal sensitive data, feature extraction is required. However, the features of different modalities of personal sensitive data are often heterogeneous, with a high level of noise and redundant information. In order to efficiently and collaboratively characterise personal sensitive data, eliminate redundant and contradictory information, and effectively fuse multimodal features, this paper proposes a novel feature extraction method based on low-rank multimodal fusion for sensitive data, which addresses the problem of difficult extraction of multimodal interaction information. The method uses self-attentive modules, tensor outer product and low-rank decomposition to build a fusion algorithm that can effectively fuse text, audio and video modal information of sensitive data. Tests on MOSI and IEMOCAP datasets show that the proposed algorithm has good feature fusion capability.",

        "abstract": "Todays computing systems are more interconnected and sophisticated than ever before. Especially in healthcare 4.0, services and infrastructures rely on cyber-physical systemss (CPSess) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This adds to the complexity of these highly connected systems and their manageability. Even worse, the variety of emerging cyber attacks is becoming more severe and sophisticated, making healthcare one of the most important sectors with major security risks. The development of appropriate countermeasures constitutes one of the most complex and difficult challenges in cyber security research. Research areas include, among others, anomaly detection, network security, multi-layer event detection, cyber resiliency, and integrity protection.  Securing the integrity of software running on a device is a desirable protection goal in the context of systems security. With a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), measured boot, and remote attestation there exist technologies to ensure that a system has booted up correctly and runs only authentic software. The Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) extends these principles into the operating systems (OSes), measuring native binaries before they are loaded. However, interpreted language files, such as Java classes and Python scripts, are not considered executables and are not measured as such. Contemporary OSess ship with many of these and it is vital to consider them as security-critical as native binaries.  In this paper, we introduce Userspace Software Integrity Measurement (USIM) for the Linux OSes. Userspace Software Integrity Measurement (USIM) enables interpreters to measure, log, and irrevocably anchor critical events in the TPM. We develop a software library in C which provides TPM-based measurement functionality as well as the USIM service, which provides concurrent access handling to the TPM based event logging. Further, we develop and implement a concept to realize highly frequent event logging on the slow TPM. We integrate this library into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to measure Java classes and show that it can be easily integrated into other interpreters. With performance measurements we demonstrate that our contribution is feasible and that overhead is negligible.",

We proposed a physical-layer authentication scheme for a WPCN. In comparison with upper-layer authentication schemes, the proposed scheme has low complexity, low power consumption, low overhead, and high security. For comprehensively analyzing the performance of the proposed scheme by considering the requirements of transmission delay, security, and reliability together, we put forward an analytical framework by considering the probabilities of transmission, security outage, connection outage, and joint security-connection outage. Based on the proposed analytical framework, we further introduced a new systematic metric by calculating the achievable throughput of all users with considering the performance of transmission-delay, security, and reliability together. We defined this new systematic metric as the overall transmission efficiency (OTE) of a WPCN, which can effectively quantize the average efficiency of message transmission in the WPCN with physical layer authentication. We analyzed the events represented by these probability factors over random fading channels and explicitly derive their closed-form expressions. For defending against jamming attacks, we further proposed another metric to estimate which user has the high probability of suffering from jamming attacks. The new metric represents that the adversary has the largest attacking gain with the minimum cost. We implemented our scheme and conducted extensive performance comparisons through simulations. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme accurately detects an impersonating attack and drops its contribution to the sum of long-term throughput.",

There are significant advancements in the threat space that have led towards an essential need for the strengthening of digital infrastructure security. Better security can be achieved by fine-tuning system parameters to the best and optimized security levels. For the protection of infrastructure and information systems, several guidelines have been provided by well-known organizations in the form of cybersecurity standards. Since security vulnerabilities incur a very high degree of financial, reputational, informational, and organizational security compromise, it is imperative that a baseline for standard compliance be established. The selection of security standards and extracting requirements from those standards in an organizational context is a tedious task. This article presents a detailed literature review, a comprehensive analysis of various cybersecurity standards, and statistics of cyber-attacks related to operating systems (OS). In addition to that, an explicit comparison between the frameworks, tools, and software available for OS compliance testing is provided. An in-depth analysis of the most common software solutions ensuring compliance with certain cybersecurity standards is also presented. Finally, based on the cybersecurity standards under consideration, a comprehensive set of minimum requirements is proposed for OS hardening and a few open research challenges are discussed.",

The LPWAN technologies offer a high range and can be used autonomously for the most part, but do not allow classic TCP/IP communication. In this work, a popular LPWAN technology, namely LoRaWAN, is experimentally supplemented by AX.25 on OSI layer 2 (Data Link Layer) to allow end devices TCP/IP-based communication over long distances.

In this paper, we present SyzGen, a first attempt to automate the generation of syscall specifications for closed-source macOS drivers and facilitate interface-aware fuzzing. We leverage two insights to overcome the challenges of binary analysis: (1) iterative refinement of syscall knowledge and (2) extraction and extrapolation of dependencies from a small number of execution traces. We evaluated our approach on 25 targets. The results show that SyzGen can effectively produce high-quality specifications, leading to 34 bugs, including one that attackers can exploit to escalate privilege, and 2 CVEs to date.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based visual sensing has achieved attractive accuracy but is shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Specifically, once the attackers obtain the deep model, they can construct adversarial examples to mislead the model to yield wrong classification results. Deployable adversarial examples such as small stickers pasted on the road signs and lanes have been shown effective in misleading advanced driver-assistance systems. Most existing countermeasures against adversarial examples build their security on the attackers’ ignorance of the defense mechanisms. Thus, they fall short of following Kerckhoffs’s principle and can be subverted once the attackers know the details of the defense. This article applies the strategy of moving target defense (MTD) to generate multiple new deep models after system deployment that will collaboratively detect and thwart adversarial examples. Our MTD design is based on the adversarial examples’ minor transferability across different models. The post-deployment of dynamically generated models significantly increase the bar of successful attacks. We also apply serial data fusion with early stopping to reduce the inference time by a factor of up to 5, as well as exploit hardware inference accelerators’ characteristics to strike better tradeoffs between inference time and power consumption. Evaluation based on three datasets including a road sign dataset and two GPU-equipped embedded computing boards shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in counteracting the attack.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of modern embedded systems, logging as a process is becoming more and more prevalent for diagnostic and analytic services. Traditionally, storage and managing of the logged data are generally kept as a part of one entity together with the main logic components. In systems that implement network connections, this activity is usually handled over a remote device. However, enabling remote connection is still considered a limiting factor for many embedded devices due to the demanding production cost. A significant challenge is presented to vendors who need to decide how the data will be extracted and handled for an embedded platform during the design concept phase. It is generally desirable that logging memory modules are able to be addressed as separate units. These devices need to be appropriately secured and verifiable on a different system since data compromise can lead to enormous privacy and even financial losses. In this paper, we present two patterns. First, a pattern that allows flexible logging operation design in terms of module and interface responsibility separation. Second, a pattern for the design of secure logging processes during the utilization of constrained embedded devices. The introduced patterns fulfil the following conditions: (i) flexibility – design is independent of the chip vendors making the logging memory modules easily replaceable, (ii) self-sufficiency – every logging controller is maintained as a separate entity in a decentralized topology, (iii) security – through providing authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity by means of using a dedicated security module.",

We present a confidential computing concept for the migration of operating system containers in secure encrypted virtual machines so that these are protected from the operator and administrator. In our approach, processes inside of the containers remain intact, i.e., they keep their state and do not have to be restarted. Network services inside of the containers remain unchanged and reachable. This is typically called live migration. Integrity and confidentiality of the data inside of the containers is enforced during migration as well as on the destination platform, namely in transit, in use and at rest. The authenticity and integrity of the destination platform is verified using remote attestation before any data is transferred. While our core concept is not specific to a particular hardware, we present two different approaches corresponding to the first generation of AMD SEV as well as SEV-SNP.

In a TEE, the confidentiality, integrity, and freshness properties for the code and data hold throughout the execution.

This results in certain limitations of a secure application’s functionality, such as no access to the file system and network – as it requires OS support.  Prior works have focused on alleviating this problem by allowing an application to access the file system securely. However, we show that they are susceptible to replay attacks, where replaying an old encrypted version of a file may remain undetected. Furthermore, they do not consider the impact of Intel SGX operations on the design of the file system.

Our results provide insights into data processing practices that foster adoption and reveal significant differences between countries, with user acceptance being highest in China and lowest in the US. Chinese participants prefer the collection of personalized data, while German and US participants favor anonymity. Across countries, contact tracing is viewed more positively than quarantine enforcement, and technical malfunctions negatively impact user acceptance.",

        "abstract": "We propose an automatic verification method for cryptographic protocols. Our method can verify whether or not the key-exchange protocol satisfies main security properties, requiring only the protocol specification as its input. The specification consists of, for example, how session keys are computed and which party sends/receives which data to/from the communication channel. We materialize our method using the Tamarin prover, which is an automatic verification tool for cryptographic protocols. To show the validity of our method, we verify main security properties of several existing protocols and find that the results coincide with what are theoretically known in cryptography. Our method is effective, because the complexity of cryptographic protocols has significantly increased in recent years. To overcome the complexity, people have started using automatic verification tools to verify the security of cryptographic protocols, but existing tools have two problems. First, the user must be familiar with the details of cryptography in order to describe formally the security model as part of input. Second, the input code is complex and its creation is error-prone; protocol specification and security model must be written in a specific language together with protocol-dependent extra codes. These two problems are resolved by our method.",

While cryptographically secure hash functions exist, there is no fast and efficient implementation for such functions on high-speed programmable switches. In this paper, we introduce an implementation of a secure keyed hash function optimized for commodity programmable switches and capable of running entirely within the data plane. We implement HalfSipHash on the Barefoot Tofino switch by using dependency management schemes to conserve pipeline stages and slicing semantics for concise circular bit shift operations. We show that our efficient implementation performs 67 million, 90 million, 150 million, and 304 million hashes per second for 32-byte, 24-byte, 16-byte, and 8-byte input strings, respectively.",

We designed an effect system around the idea of protecting system resources and incorporated our effect system into the Wyvern programming language. Similar to type members, a Wyvern object can have effect members that can abstract lower-level effects, allow for aggregation, and have both lower and upper bounds, providing for a granular effect hierarchy. We argue that Wyvern’s effects capture the right balance of expressiveness and power from the programming language design perspective. We present a full formalization of our effect-system design, showing that it allows reasoning about authority and attenuation. Our approach is evaluated through a security-related case study.",

Federated learning and distributed learning refer to training machine learning models in the edge computing network.

In this article, we study the vulnerabilities of federated GMs to data-poisoning-based backdoor attacks via gradient uploading. We additionally enhance the attack to reduce the required poisonous data samples and cope with dynamic network environments.

        "abstract": "Different from cloud computing, edge computing moves computing away from the centralized data center and closer to the end-user. Therefore, with the large-scale deployment of edge services, it becomes a new challenge of how to dynamically select the appropriate edge server for computing requesters based on the edge server and network status. In the TCP/IP architecture, edge computing applications rely on centralized proxy servers to select an appropriate edge server, which leads to additional network overhead and increases service response latency. Due to its powerful forwarding plane, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has the potential to provide more efficient networking support for edge computing than TCP/IP. However, traditional ICN only addresses named data and cannot well support the handle of dynamic content. In this article, we propose an edge computing service architecture based on ICN, which contains the edge computing service session model, service request forwarding strategies, and service dynamic deployment mechanism. The proposed service session model can not only keep the overhead low but also push the results to the computing requester immediately once the computing is completed. However, the service request forwarding strategies can forward computing requests to an appropriate edge server in a distributed manner. Compared with the TCP/IP-based proxy solution, our forwarding strategy can avoid unnecessary network transmissions, thereby reducing the service completion time. Moreover, the service dynamic deployment mechanism decides whether to deploy an edge service on an edge server based on service popularity, so that edge services can be dynamically deployed to hotspot, further reducing the service completion time.",

However, large-scale edge computing networks can suffer substantially from unpredictable and unreliable computing resources which can result in high variability of service quality. We consider the problem of computation offloading over unknown edge cloud networks with a sequence of timely computation jobs. Motivated by the MapReduce computation paradigm, we assume that each computation job can be partitioned to smaller Map functions which are processed at the edge, and the Reduce function is computed at the user after the Map results are collected from the edge nodes. We model the service quality of each edge device as function of context. The user decides the computations to offload to each device with the goal of receiving a recoverable set of computation results in the given deadline. By leveraging the <italic>coded computing</italic> framework in order to tackle failures or stragglers in computation, we formulate this problem using contextual-combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CC-MAB), and aim to maximize the cumulative expected reward.

Today's embedded SoCs are becoming increasingly high-performance and complex, comprising multiple cores, accelerators, and IP blocks interconnected with a Network-on-Chip (NoC). As these IPs can originate from diverse sources, they cannot be trusted to form the root of trust in SoCs. However, the NoC itself, being the communication backbone linking all IPs, is naturally positioned to be the basis for a secure SoC. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient solution that both meets the stringent requirements of modern embedded SoC designs, while maintaining a high level of security. In this paper, we demonstrate how statically-scheduled NoCs inherently enforce traffic isolation and non-interference of communication. The time-division multiplexing (TDM) of NoC links across applications provably ensures that security properties are fulfilled. However, conventional TDM NoCs are still vulnerable to side-channel attacks. We thus propose temporal and data obfuscation schemes that can be embedded within static TDM NoCs, randomizing source-destination communication patterns and switching activity over the links. Our proposed statically-scheduled Sentry-NoC links up untrusted IP blocks to form a secure SoC. Sentry-NoC targets key security properties to effectively mitigate side-channel attacks with an extremely low overhead, reducing average temporal correlation by 81% and average data correlation by 91%.",

Test cases were planned around the questions and a sample set of vendor products typically used in the oil and gas sector. Four systems were composed from different product subsets and were assessed using the test cases. We analyzed results from the four assessments to illuminate issues that existed regardless of system composition.  Analysis revealed recurring vulnerabilities that exist in all safety systems due to issues in the design of safety instruments and the HART protocol. We found that device-native hardware write-protections provide the best defense, followed by SIS write protections. We concluded that, when using SIS security controls, an SIS-mediated system can protect against unauthorized device reconfigurations better than can a MUX-based system.

The detection of these attacks mainly relies on creating master-profile and machine learning by printing every unique object in a protected environment.

This paper presents Sophos, a framework to detect nozzle-kinetic, filament-kinetic and thermodynamic attacks on the fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 3D printing process. Sophos design does not require any prior learning for every unique object. It can detect the attacks on the first print using spatiotemporal G-code modeling, aligning it with the Industry 4.0 vision. Sophos is scalable and supports modular upgrades to suit different printing requirements. Its design allows the detection threshold to be reduced conveniently to as low as the 3D printer's resolution, shifting the game to a more interesting study of attack patterns than attack magnitudes.",

Dynamic variable cryptographic algorithm can improve the security and adaptability of cryptographic algorithm, which is the focus of cryptographic algorithm research and design at present. The key to the research and design of dynamic variable cryptographic algorithms is to find dynamic variable cryptographic components with good cryptographic performance. MDS (Maximum Distance Separable) is often used in the diffusion layer design of block ciphers because of its optimal diffusion characteristics. Traditional MDS transformation generally adopts MDS matrices in the finite field. While using them in dynamic variable cryptographic algorithms, it is difficult to realize parametric application because of their logical differences and implementation imbalance. Aiming at the lightweight MDS variable design requirements of dynamic variable cryptographic algorithm, this paper firstly proposes a MDS parametric construction method based on block cyclic shift and XOR operation. Compared with the traditional MDS construction in the finite field, we obtain a class of MDS component clusters with larger scale which is convenient for software and hardware implementation. The main design idea is to convert the multiplication operation in the finite field into cyclic shift operation, and introduce parameters to participate in the MDS operation in the way of direct XOR. Based on the MDS matrix in AES diffusion layer, two kinds of variable MDS diffusion layers are given by this method. The consistent structure based on cyclic shift and XOR operation is adopted, and each parameter corresponds to different MDS transformation, which can be used for the parametric design of diffusion layer of dynamic variable cryptographic algorithm.",

Intelligent transport systems (ITS) have merged as an efficient way to overcome particularly this kind of problem in vehicular networks (VANETs) and improve performance of transportation systems. One of the solutions is to put intelligent traffic lights at each intersection of high vehicle density. In this paper, we propose a cloud computing based intelligent traffic light control algorithm, called CITLA. This algorithm aims to schedule the traffic by switching the phases of the traffic lights dynamically according to the state of the road in real time based on the conventional cloud. The Cloud has a global view on the road network since it is responsible for collecting road information via the RSUs placed on each street corner. It commutes thereafter, based on the information collected, the density of each road so as to minimize the waiting time and congestion on the roads. The results of these calculations are transmitted in real time to the RSUs which are responsible for controlling the traffic lights by changing the phases. The feasibility of CITLA was demonstrated through simulations using the discrete event simulator OMNeT++ with Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO).",

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the notification, as shown to the user, is not uniquely bound to the user's login session running through the browser, and thus if two notifications are sent around the same time (one for the user's session and one for an attacker's session), the user may not be able to distinguish between the two, likely ending up accepting the notification of the attacker's session. Exploiting this vulnerability, we present HIENA, a simple yet devastating attack against such \"one-push\" 2FA or passwordless schemes, which can allow a malicious actor to login soon after the victim user attempts to login triggering multiple near-concurrent notifications that seem indistinguishable to the user. To further deceive the user into accepting the attacker-triggered notification, HIENA can optionally spoof/mimic the victim's client machine information (e.g., the city from which the victim logs in, by being in the same city) and even issue other third-party notifications (e.g., email or social media) for obfuscation purposes. In case of 2FA schemes, we assume that the attacker knows the victim's password (e.g., obtained via breached password databases), a standard methodology to evaluate the security of any 2FA scheme. To evaluate the effectiveness of HIENA, we carefully designed and ran a human factors lab study where we tested benign and adversarial settings mimicking the user interface designs of well-known one-push 2FA and passwordless schemes. Our results show that users are prone to accepting attacker's notification in HIENA with high rates, about 83% overall and about 99% upon using spoofed information, which is almost similar to the rates of acceptance of benign login sessions. Even for the non-spoofed sessions (our primary attack), the attack success rates are about 68%, which go up to about 90-97% if the attack attempt is repeated 2-3 times. While we did not see a statistically significant effect of using third-party notifications on attack success rate, in real-life, the use of such obfuscation can be quite effective as users may only see one single 2FA notification (corresponding to attacker's session) on top of the notifications list which is most likely to be accepted. We have verified that many widely deployed one-push 2FA schemes (e.g., Duo Push, Authy OneTouch, LastPass, Facebook's and OpenOTP) seem directly vulnerable to our attack.",

The aim of this paper is to offer a legal perspective on the forces tensioning in the most common authentication methods implemented in these devices, account taken of the particularities of an IoT ecosystem.

The previous K-means outlier detection methods are easy to be misled by outliers in the clustering process and cannot detect outliers well. To solve this problem, we propose a method of outlier detection based on an improved K-means clustering algorithm. This method adaptively detects edge points (including outliers and edge points of other clusters) through the local threshold obtained from the distance distribution of the data points in the cluster to the centroid. The edge points are ignored when the centroid is updated to avoid the situation that the edge points mislead the centroid update. After completing the clustering, the farthest point in each cluster is put into the outlier cluster iteratively. When the average distance of the data in the cluster reaches stability or reaches the maximum number of iterations, the iteration ends. This method retains the ease of use of traditional K-means which accelerates the speed of clustering iteration and finds outliers accurately in data sets. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively detect outliers and have good results on multiple data sets.",

The ability to successfully evade unseen models represents an uncomfortable level of ease toward implementing attacks. In this work we note that as studied, current transfer attack research has an unrealistic advantage for the attacker: the attacker has the exact same training data as the victim. We present the first study of transferring adversarial attacks focusing on the data available to attacker and victim under imperfect settings without querying the victim, where there is some variable level of overlap in the exact data used or in the classes learned by each model. This threat model is relevant to applications in medicine, malware, and others. Under this new threat model attack success rate is not correlated with data or class overlap in the way one would expect, and varies with dataset. This makes it difficult for attacker and defender to reason about each other and contributes to the broader study of model robustness and security. We remedy this by developing a masked version of Projected Gradient Descent that simulates class disparity, which enables the attacker to reliably estimate a lower-bound on their attack's success.",

However, if the third-party providers are untrusted, they can inject poisoned samples into the datasets or embed backdoors in those models. Such an integrity breach can cause severe consequences, especially in safety- and security-critical applications. Various backdoor attack techniques have been proposed for higher effectiveness and stealthiness. Unfortunately, existing defense solutions are not practical to thwart those attacks in a comprehensive way. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques in mitigating backdoor attacks and enhancing DL models' robustness. An evaluation framework is introduced to achieve this goal. Specifically, we consider a unified defense solution, which (1) adopts a data augmentation policy to fine-tune the infected model and eliminate the effects of the embedded backdoor; (2) uses another augmentation policy to preprocess input samples and invalidate the triggers during inference. We propose a systematic approach to discover the optimal policies for defending against different backdoor attacks by comprehensively evaluating 71 state-of-the-art data augmentation functions. Extensive experiments show that our identified policy can effectively mitigate eight different kinds of backdoor attacks and outperform five existing defense methods. We envision this framework can be a good benchmark tool to advance future DNN backdoor studies.",

Through analyzing the evolution of the number of connections, the number of network segments, the number of IP addresses, the number of nodes, the number of cores, the number of betweenness, and the average length of the path, and so on. Some regularities of network evolution are summarized. Firstly, some characteristics of the network are strongly correlated with each other. Since 2012, this kind of node has resumed its main part in the network whose number of degrees is 1, because the nodes of countries with late network development have gradually increased their influence. The evolution of the national autonomous system network characteristics is self-similar to the global network, but there are certain differences in different countries.

        "abstract": "Because of the powerful computing and storage capability in cloud computing, machine learning as a service (MLaaS) has recently been valued by the organizations for machine learning training over some related representative datasets. When these datasets are collected from different organizations and have different distributions, multi-task learning (MTL) is usually used to improve the generalization performance by scheduling the related training tasks into the virtual machines in MLaaS and transferring the related knowledge between those tasks. However, because of concerns about privacy breaches (e.g., property inference attack and model inverse attack), organizations cannot directly outsource their training data to MLaaS or share their extracted knowledge in plaintext, especially the organizations in sensitive domains. In this article, we propose a novel privacy-preserving mechanism for distributed MTL, namely NOInfer, to allow several task nodes to train the model locally and transfer their shared knowledge privately. Specifically, we construct a single-server architecture to achieve the private MTL, which protects task nodes’ local data even if \\(n-1\\) out of \\(n\\) nodes colluded. Then, a new protocol for the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is designed to perform the privacy-preserving model training, which resists the inference attack through the intermediate results and ensures that the training efficiency is independent of the number of training samples. When releasing the trained model, we also design a differentially private model releasing mechanism to resist the membership inference attack. Furthermore, we analyze the privacy preservation and efficiency of NOInfer in theory. Finally, we evaluate our NOInfer over two testing datasets and evaluation results demonstrate that NOInfer efficiently and effectively achieves the distributed MTL.",

Recently, a more promising approach by combining the exploration in the action space with the exploration in the parameters space has been proposed to get the best of both methods. In this article, we propose a new iterative and close-loop framework by combining the evolutionary algorithm (EA), which does explorations in a gradient-free manner directly in the parameters space with an actor-critic, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm, which does explorations in a gradient-based manner in the action space to make these two methods cooperate in a more balanced and efficient way. In our framework, the policies represented by the EA population (the parametric perturbation part) can evolve in a guided manner by utilizing the gradient information provided by the DDPG and the policy gradient part (DDPG) is used only as a fine-tuning tool for the best individual in the EA population to improve the sample efficiency. In particular, we propose a criterion to determine the training steps required for the DDPG to ensure that useful gradient information can be generated from the EA generated samples and the DDPG and EA part can work together in a more balanced way during each generation. Furthermore, within the DDPG part, our algorithm can flexibly switch between fine-tuning the same previous RL-Actor and fine-tuning a new one generated by the EA according to different situations to further improve the efficiency. Experiments on a range of challenging continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms related works and offers a satisfactory trade-off between stability and sample efficiency.",

By defining Organization in blockchain network which can participate in the supply chain management process, this paper demonstrates the benefits of utilizing Hyperledger Fabric for managing acquired software components that are introduced in critical infrastructure. Given the analyzed use cases and proposed architecture, it can be concluded that Hyperledger Fabric blockchain provides necessary trust in a multi-party environment which is the basis for more efficient auditing of the whole process. The trustworthy logs and easier auditing are the key enablers for a supply chain management process that can address the described needs.",

        "abstract": "Edge computing has been gaining momentum lately as a means to complement cloud computing for shorter response time, better user experience, and improved data security. Traditional approaches of edge-cloud computing take two major forms: One is to offload the computation from an edge device to the cloud so as to take advantage of the virtually unlimited resources in the cloud and reduce the computation time. The other is to move selected computation to the edge devices where data are produced, actions are performed and users are located. However, in practice, it is often difficult to split the computation tasks of an application and decide which tasks should be performed in the cloud and which at the edge. The reason is that, for the same computation, it may sometimes be beneficial to execute it in the cloud while other times at the edge, depending on run-time conditions such as the data size, the type of computation, and the communication delay, which all varies from time to time. This paper proposes a new edge-cloud computing model, called the full mirror model, which provides a generic method to circumvent the problem of dynamic decisions on the execution location. With a two-thread implementation mechanism, the new model is able to achieve an execution completion time approximately equal to the smaller one between cloud execution and edge execution, regardless of what run-time conditions are. We test the new model by modifying an existing program for network traffic analysis so that it runs at both the edge and the cloud in a coordinated fashion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms edge-alone computing and cloud-alone computing in reducing the execution time.",

        "abstract": "Context. Computing Education Research (CER) is critical to help the computing education community and policy makers support the increasing population of students who need to learn computing skills for future careers. For a community to systematically advance knowledge about a topic, the members must be able to understand published work thoroughly enough to perform replications, conduct meta-analyses, and build theories. There is a need to understand whether published research allows the CER community to systematically advance knowledge and build theories. Objectives. The goal of this study is to characterize the reporting of empiricism in Computing Education Research literature by identifying whether publications include content necessary for researchers to perform replications, meta-analyses, and theory building. We answer three research questions related to this goal: (RQ1) What percentage of papers in CER venues have some form of empirical evaluation? (RQ2) Of the papers that have empirical evaluation, what are the characteristics of the empirical evaluation? (RQ3) Of the papers that have empirical evaluation, do they follow norms (both for inclusion and for labeling of information needed for replication, meta-analysis, and, eventually, theory-building) for reporting empirical work? Methods. We conducted a systematic literature review of the 2014 and 2015 proceedings or issues of five CER venues: Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS), International Symposium on Computing Education Research (ICER), Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE), ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE), and Computer Science Education (CSE). We developed and applied the CER Empiricism Assessment Rubric to the 427 papers accepted and published at these venues over 2014 and 2015. Two people evaluated each paper using the Base Rubric for characterizing the paper. An individual person applied the other rubrics to characterize the norms of reporting, as appropriate for the paper type. Any discrepancies or questions were discussed between multiple reviewers to resolve. Results. We found that over 80% of papers accepted across all five venues had some form of empirical evaluation. Quantitative evaluation methods were the most frequently reported. Papers most frequently reported results on interventions around pedagogical techniques, curriculum, community, or tools. There was a split in papers that had some type of comparison between an intervention and some other dataset or baseline. Most papers reported related work, following the expectations for doing so in the SIGCSE and CER community. However, many papers were lacking properly reported research objectives, goals, research questions, or hypotheses; description of participants; study design; data collection; and threats to validity. These results align with prior surveys of the CER literature. Conclusions. CER authors are contributing empirical results to the literature; however, not all norms for reporting are met. We encourage authors to provide clear, labeled details about their work so readers can use the study methodologies and results for replications and meta-analyses. As our community grows, our reporting of CER should mature to help establish computing education theory to support the next generation of computing learners.",

        "abstract": "Rowhammer attacks exploit electromagnetic interference among nearby DRAM cells to flip bits, corrupting data and altering system behavior. Unfortunately, DRAM vendors have opted for a blackbox approach to preventing these bit flips, exposing little information about in-DRAM mitigations. Despite vendor claims that their mitigations prevent Rowhammer, recent work bypasses these defenses to corrupt data. Further work shows that the Rowhammer problem is actually worsening in emerging DRAM and posits that system-level support is needed to produce adaptable and scalable defenses. Accordingly, we argue that the systems community can and must drive a fundamental change in Rowhammer mitigation techniques. In the short term, cloud providers and CPU vendors must work together to supplement limited in-DRAM mitigations---ill-equipped to handle rising susceptibility---with their own mitigations. We propose novel hardware primitives in the CPU's integrated memory controller that would enable a variety of efficient software defenses, offering flexible safeguards against future attacks. In the long term, we assert that major consumers of DRAM must persuade DRAM vendors to provide precise information on their defenses, limitations, and necessary supplemental solutions.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) for developing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is a fast-evolving research area that has many unsolved domain challenges. Current IDS models face two challenges that limit their performance and robustness. Firstly, they require large datasets to train and their performance is highly dependent on the dataset size. Secondly, zero-day attacks demand that machine learning models are retrained in order to identify future attacks of this type. However, the sophistication and increasing rate of cyber attacks make retraining time prohibitive for practical implementation. This paper proposes a new IDS model that can learn from pair similarities rather than class discriminative features. Learning similarities requires less data for training and provides the ability to flexibly adapt to new cyber attacks, thus reducing the burden of retraining. The underlying model is based on Siamese Networks, therefore, given a number of instances, numerous similar and dissimilar pairs can be generated. The model is evaluated using three mainstream IDS datasets; CICIDS2017, KDD Cup'99, and NSL-KDD. The evaluation results confirm the ability of the Siamese Network model to suit IDS purposes by classifying cyber attacks based on similarity-based learning. This opens a new research direction for building adaptable IDS models using non-conventional ML techniques.",

In this paper, we present our first steps towards thorough modeling of quantum communications for multi-core quantum computers, which may be considered as a middle point between the well-known paradigms of Quantum Internet and Network-on-Chip. In particular, we stress the deep entanglement that exists between latency and error rates in quantum computing, and how this affects the quantum network design for this scenario. Moreover, we show the concomitant trade-off between computation and communication resources for a set of parameters out of state-of-the-art experimental research.

        "abstract": "The Philippines is an archipelago or string of over 7,640 islands in southeastern Asia. With the community's active support, the Philippine National Police (PNP) is entrusted with upholding the law, preventing and controlling crimes, maintaining peace and order, and ensuring public safety and internal security. There are currently 1,766 police stations across the country. With the geographical challenges, criminal identification procedures take time to complete. The Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) addresses the issues. MAFIS is currently deployed and implemented in a cloud platform that can be accessed by authorized police personnel from the web and mobile application to expedite fingerprint identification procedures. In today's world, the internet has become the de facto standard for low-cost communications architecture, as well as a significant convenience for organizations and businesses seeking to expand their operations. Because the internet is widely available in practically every region, companies frequently demand it for their local presence. As a result, a secure route within this communication network is required to ensure confidential data crossing the public network. The fast rise of digital gadgets and their Internet connectivity has resulted in security vulnerabilities to user data. Security and privacy threats have become more sophisticated day by day, increasing the demand for an updated and highly secure medium to secure entities and their valuable information on the internet. Advanced measures and high technical skills adapted by attackers, security, and privacy threats have become more sophisticated day by day, increasing the demand for an updated and highly secure medium to secure entities and their valuable information into the internet. There are other alternatives available on the market today, but the Virtual Private Network (VPN) is the most popular for establishing a secure connection over the public internet. Constructing a tunnel between the sender and receiver provides the convenience of a shared network while also providing the security of a private network. The researchers took advantage of the opportunity to create the MAFIS Overlay Network, a secure network design for MAFIS that runs over a virtual private network (VPN). Two VPN implementations were considered on the strategy: a site-to-site VPN connecting all of the law-enforcement agencies' remote offices and a remote-access VPN for the scene-of-the-crime operatives (SOCO). Speed and performance tests were performed using the industry-standard method to ensure the framework's consistency for mobile and web applications. The overall performance scores were 99 and 87 for web and mobile apps, respectively. The speed and performance test results acquired on all of the system's modules in three different criteria in terms of performance, interaction, and visual stability are significantly better than the recommended value and are thus considered highly acceptable. Overall, MAFIS has satisfactorily passed the security and compliance tests conducted and is reflected as highly satisfactory.",

        "abstract": "The prospect of large-scale quantum computers necessitates the design, development, and standardization of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructures are expected to be among the first industrial environments to adopt PQC. As their components have a long life span (≥ 10 years) and are increasingly interconnected to form an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), they require strong and long-lasting security guarantees. Because of these high-security requirements, IIoT products are also increasingly equipped with additional hardware security elements — often Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).  In this work, we study how the current TPM 2.0 specification can supplement the migration towards PQC. Therefore, we integrate the post-quantum (PQ) key exchange CRYSTALS-Kyber, the post-quantum signature scheme SPHINCS, and TPM functionality into the open-source TLS library Mbed TLS. For our performance evaluations we propose three post-quantum TLS cipher suites alongside two different TPM utilization strategies. We report the standalone performance of the aforementioned post-quantum schemes under our proposed TPM utilizations and compare it to current elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Finally, we report the handshake duration of post-quantum and mutually authenticated TLS (mTLS) connections for our proposed cipher suites with regards to the different TPM utilization scenarios.  Our results show that the integration of PQC into mTLS is generally feasible, thus ensuring additional post-quantum client authentication. Regarding our TPM utilizations, we observe a significant decrease in performance when offloading computations of hash functions. However, offloading the generation of random numbers to TPMs in our integrated post-quantum schemes proves to be efficient, ultimately enhancing overall system security.",

This symbolic value-flow (“symvalic”) analysis models program behavior with high precision, e.g., full path sensitivity. To achieve deep modeling of program semantics, the analysis relies on a symbiotic relationship between a traditional static analysis fixpoint computation and a symbolic solver: the solver does not merely receive a complex “path condition” to solve, but is instead invoked repeatedly (often tens or hundreds of thousands of times), in close cooperation with the flow computation of the analysis. The result of the symvalic analysis architecture is a static modeling of program behavior that is much more complete than symbolic execution, much more precise than conventional static analysis, and domain-agnostic: no special-purpose definition of anti-patterns is necessary in order to compute violations of safety conditions with high precision. We apply the analysis to the domain of Ethereum smart contracts. This domain represents a fundamental challenge for program analysis approaches: despite numerous publications, research work has not been effective at uncovering vulnerabilities of high real-world value. In systematic comparison of symvalic analysis with past tools, we find significantly increased completeness (shown as 83-96% statement coverage and more true error reports) combined with much higher precision, as measured by rate of true positive reports. In terms of real-world impact, since the beginning of 2021, the analysis has resulted in the discovery and disclosure of several critical vulnerabilities, over funds in the many millions of dollars.

Also, existing anti-virtualization techniques are ineffective since the malicious container can intercept - and tamper with - such controls at runtime. So far, only two solutions have been specifically designed to address virtualization-based repackaging attacks. However, their effectiveness is limited since they both rely on static taint analysis, thus not being able to evaluate code dynamically loaded at runtime.  To mitigate such a problem, in this paper we introduce MARVEL, the first methodology that allows preventing both traditional and virtualization-based repackaging attacks. MARVEL strongly relies on the virtualization technique to build a secure virtual environment where protected apps can run and be checked at runtime. To assess the viability and reliability of MARVEL, we implemented it in a tool, i.e., MARVELoid, that we tested by protecting 4000 apps with 24 different configurations of the protection parameters (i.e., 96k protection combinations). MARVELoid was able to inject the protection into 97.3% of the cases, with a processing time of 98 seconds per app on average. Moreover, we evaluated the runtime overhead on 45 apps, showing that the introduced protection has a negligible impact in terms of average CPU (<5%) and memory overhead (<0.5%).",

Many intelligent systems have been developing, considering uncertainties in the cloud. Intelligent approaches with the consideration of uncertainties bring optimal management with higher profitability. Uncertainties of different levels and different types exist in various domains of cloud computing. This survey aims to discuss all types of uncertainties and their effect on different components of cloud computing. The article first presents the concept of uncertainty and its quantification. A vast number of uncertain events influence the cloud, as it is connected with the entire world through the internet. Five major uncertain parameters are identified, which are directly affected by numerous uncertain events and affect the performance of the cloud. Notable events affecting major uncertain parameters are also described. Besides, we present notable uncertainty-aware research works in cloud computing. A hype curve on uncertainty-aware approaches in the cloud is also presented to visualize current conditions and future possibilities. We expect the inauguration of numerous uncertainty-aware intelligent systems in cloud management over time. This article may provide a deeper understanding of managing cloud resources with uncertainties efficiently to future cloud researchers.",

Results from such proliferation were seen during the 2016 and 2020 elections in the United States. The reach of false information in the context of a U.S. Presidential election would not be the pinnacle of the harm it can cause. In the current context, the spread of false information in the middle of a pandemic and related to causes, cures, and conspiracies, has the potential to do real harm, if it has not already. Now that vaccines are widely available in some countries, this harm may result in lives being lost that did not have to be. In this paper, we explore vaccination status in the context of information sources used by individuals. The results suggest that a lack of trust and engagement in traditional news outlets is associated with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccination initiation or completion. Higher levels of engagement with sources that have been used in the past to propagate conspiracy theories, such as YouTube, are also associated with lower levels of vaccination initiation or completion. Public health implications and the need for greater information literacy are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based classifiers rely on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to provide functionalities that system architects are often willing to integrate into critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). However, such algorithms may misclassify observations, with potential detrimental effects on the system itself or on the health of people and of the environment. In addition, CPSs may be subject to threats that were not previously known, motivating the need for building Intrusion Detectors (IDs) that can effectively deal with zero-day attacks. Different studies were directed to compare misclassifications of various algorithms to identify the most suitable one for a given system. Unfortunately, even the most suitable algorithm may still show an unsatisfactory number of misclassifications when system requirements are strict. A possible solution may rely on the adoption of meta-learners, which build ensembles of base-learners to reduce misclassifications and that are widely used for supervised learning. Meta-learners have the potential to reduce misclassifications with respect to non-meta learners: however, misleading base-learners may let the meta-learner leaning towards misclassifications and therefore their behavior needs to be carefully assessed through empirical evaluation. To such extent, in this paper we investigate, expand, empirically evaluate, and discuss meta-learning approaches that rely on ensembles of unsupervised algorithms to detect (zero-day) intrusions in CPSs. Our experimental comparison is conducted by means of public datasets belonging to network intrusion detection and biometric authentication systems, which are common IDSs for CPSs. Overall, we selected 21 datasets, 15 unsupervised algorithms and 9 different meta-learning approaches. Results allow discussing the applicability and suitability of meta-learning for unsupervised anomaly detection, comparing metric scores achieved by base algorithms and meta-learners. Analyses and discussion end up showing how the adoption of meta-learners significantly reduces misclassifications when detecting (zero-day) intrusions in CPSs.",

Lippa [29] uncovered a relationship between gender and preference within the People–Things spectrum, with women preferring People-oriented activities to a higher degree than men. The aim of this paper is twofold. First of all, we wish to determine if a similar relation can be established in the particular context of computing educational activities. Second of all, we wish to see if Lippa’s findings can be extrapolated to contemporary high-school students. To do that, we designed and conducted an experiment involving around 500 Danish high-school students who have been asked to choose between a People-themed version vs an isomorphic Things-themed version of four activities representative for computing education. The results show that the odds of a woman preferring a task involving People is 2.7 times higher than those of a man. The odds of a student without prior programming experience preferring a task involving People is 1.4 times higher than those of a student with programming experience. If we compare women without programming experience to men with programming experience the effect is even more pronounced; indeed, the combined effect is 3.8 (2.7 × 1.4). Our study implies a recommendation for computing educators to, whenever possible, favor educational activities involving People over Things. This makes educational activities appeal more to female students (and to students without programming experience), while not making a difference for male students (or students with programming experience). Since the experiment measured only the appeal of tasks (the users were not expected to perform them) the results we obtained can be useful for recruitment processes where the overall image and appeal of material makes a difference.",

Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides an isolated Trust Execution Environment (TEE) for task security guarantee. However, we notice that DNN inference performance in SGX is severely affected by the limited enclave memory space due to the resultant frequent page swapping operations and the high enclave call overhead. To tackle this problem, we propose Lasagna, an SGX oriented DNN inference performance acceleration framework without compromising the task security. Lasagna consists of a local task scheduler and a global task balancer to optimize the system performance by exploring the layered-structure of DNN models. Our experiment results show that our layer-aware Lasagna effectively speeds up the well-known DNN inference in SGX by 1.31x-1.97x.",

In this paper, we show that even when no speakers are available, we can play malicious commands by utilizing the capacitors inside electronic devices, i.e., we convert capacitors into speakers and call it CapSpeaker. Essentially, capacitors can emit acoustic noises due to the inverse piezoelectric effect, i.e., varying the voltage across a capacitor can make it vibrate and thus emit acoustic noises. Forcing capacitors to play malicious voice commands is challenging because (1) the frequency responses of capacitors as speakers have poor performance in the range of audible voices, and (2) we have no direct control over the voltage across capacitors to manipulate their emitting sounds. To overcome the challenges, we use a PWM-based modulation scheme to embed the malicious audio onto a high-frequency carrier, e.g., above 20 kHz, and we create malware that can induce the right voltage across the capacitors such that CapSpeaker plays the chosen malicious commands. We conducted extensive experiments with 2 LED lamps (a modified one and a commercial one) and 5 victim devices (iPhone 4s, iPad mini 5, Huawei Nova 5i, etc.). Evaluation results demonstrate that CapSpeaker is feasible at a distance up to 10.5 cm, triggering a smartphone to receive voice commands, e.g., \"open the door''.",

However, the related terminology is not unified among the different domains, such as digital media steganography, text steganography, cyber-physical systems steganography, network steganography (network covert channels), local covert channels, and out-of-band covert channels. To cope with this, a prime attempt has been done in 2015, with the introduction of the so-called hiding patterns, which allow to describe hiding techniques in a more abstract manner. Despite significant enhancements, the main limitation of such a taxonomy is that it only considers the case of network steganography.  Therefore, this paper reviews both the terminology and the taxonomy of hiding patterns as to make them more general. Specifically, hiding patterns are split into those that describe the embedding and the representation of hidden data within the cover object.  As a first research action, we focus on embedding hiding patterns and we show how they can be applied to multiple domains of steganography instead of being limited to the network scenario. Additionally, we exemplify representation patterns using network steganography. Our pattern collection is available under https://patterns.ztt.hs-worms.de.",

However, if a PLC is compromised or the commands sent across a network from the PLCs are spoofed, consequences could be catastrophic. In this work, a novel technique to authenticate PLCs is proposed that aims at raising the bar against powerful attackers while being compatible with real-time systems. The proposed technique captures timing information for each controller in a non-invasive manner. It is argued that Scan Cycle is a unique feature of a PLC that can be approximated passively by observing network traffic. An attacker that spoofs commands issued by the PLCs would deviate from such fingerprints. To detect replay attacks a PLC Watermarking technique is proposed. PLC Watermarking models the relation between the scan cycle and the control logic by modeling the input/output as a function of request/response messages of a PLC. The proposed technique is validated on an operational water treatment plant (SWaT) and smart grid (EPIC) testbeds. Results from experiments indicate that PLCs can be distinguished based on their scan cycle timing characteristics.",

However, a new social crisis has also come with it. Because of the need for platform expansion, most online ride-hailing drivers have not undergone strict professional ethics reviews, which increases the risk of passengers taking the car. Primarily, female users are more susceptible to abuse and harassment and even persecution by drivers due to their disadvantaged position. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is happening every day and even getting worse. Regarding this aspect of supervision, it is difficult for relevant departments to have a more direct management plan. However, it is difficult for relevant departments to give a more natural and effective management plan. Therefore, ensuring the safety of passengers (predominantly female passengers) using online car-hailing becomes particularly important. In the Chinese field, few people try to improve this problem from the perspective of natural language. This work expects to use natural language technology to evaluate the driver's language and determine the degree of potential danger and criminal tendency, thus protecting the passenger and providing evidence for the judicial authorities. We first collected many dialogues between drivers and passengers, then used back translation to expand the corpus.

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of distributed applications, smart contracts have attracted more and more developers' attentions. However, developers or domain experts have different levels of familiarity with specific programming languages, like Solidity, and those vulnerabilities hidden in the code would be exploited and result in huge property losses. Existing auxiliary tools lack security considerations. Most of them only provide word completion based on fuzzy search and detection services for limited types of vulnerabilities, which results in the manpower waste during coding and potential vulnerability threats after deployment.   In this work, we propose an integrated framework to enhance security in the two stages of recommendation and validation, assisting developers to implement more secure contracts more quickly. First, we reinforce original smart contracts with general patch patterns and secure programming standards for training, and design a real-time code suggestion algorithm to predict secure words for selection. Then, we integrate multiple widely-used testing tools to provide validation services. For evaluation, we collected 47,398 real-world contracts, and the result shows that it outperforms existing platforms and tools, improving the average word suggestion accuracy by 30%-60% and helping detect about 25%-61% more vulnerabilities. In most cases, our framework can correctly predict next words with the probability up to 82%-97% within top ten candidates. Compared with professional vulnerability mining tools, it can find more vulnerabilities and provide targeted modification suggestions without frivolous configurations. Currently, this framework has been used as the official development tool of WeBank and integrated as the recommended platform by FISCO-BCOS community.",

The study shows that the dynamism of the crisis and the federally varying strategies burden citizens who perceive an obligation to stay informed, but view agencies as responsible for making information readily available.

        "abstract": "Proximity attacks allow an adversary to uncover the location of a victim by repeatedly issuing queries with fake location data. These attacks have been mostly studied in scenarios where victims remain static and there are no constraints that limit the actions of the attacker. In such a setting, it is not difficult for the attacker to locate a particular victim and quantifying the effort for doing so is straightforward. However, it is far more realistic to consider scenarios where potential victims present a particular mobility pattern. In this article, we consider abstract (constrained and unconstrained) attacks on services that provide location information on other users in the proximity. We derive strategies for constrained and unconstrained attackers, and show that when unconstrained they can practically achieve success with theoretically optimal effort. We then propose a simple yet effective constraint that may be employed by a proximity service (for example, running in the cloud or using a suitable two-party protocol) as a countermeasure to increase the effort for the attacker several orders of magnitude both in simulated and real-world cases.",

Some species have very little difference in characteristics, making it difficult to distinguish visually. It is for the above reasons that the classification of marine organisms is facing great difficulties. Based on the characteristics of marine biological image data sets, this paper has carried out research on classification schemes of marine biological fine-grained species. Initially, the EfficientNet-b5 single model is used for training. During the training process, tricks such as Cutmix, Autoaugment, label smoothing, and CBAM modules are added, and the final accuracy is as high as 96.59%. Since features of different scales have different semantic information, the solution improves the single model, uses EfficientNet-b3 and EfficientNet-b6 for multi-scale fusion, and embeds the CBAM mechanism into different scales to obtain richer features information. Finally, experiments were conducted on the existing ocean image data set, and the accuracy rate reached 97.82%, which confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.",

SNOW-Vi differs in the way how the LFSR is updated and also introduces a new location of the tap T2 for stronger security, while everything else is kept the same as in SNOW-V. The throughput in a software environment is increased by around 50% in average, up to 92 Gbps. This makes the applicability of the cipher much wider and more use cases are covered. The security analyses previously done for SNOW-V are not affected in most aspects, and SNOW-Vi provides the same 256-bit security level as SNOW-V.",

In such cases, transmission time and preprocessing time are coupled, yielding a tradeoff between them to achieve the targeted objective. This paper presents analysis of such a system with the objective of optimizing freshness of received data at the edge server. We model this system as two queues in tandem whose service times are independent but the transmission service time is monotonically dependent on the computation service time in mean value. This dependence captures the natural decrease in transmission time due to lower offloaded computation. We analyze various queue management schemes in this tandem queue where the compute queue has a single server, Poisson packet arrivals, general independent service and no extra buffer to save incoming packets. The transmit queue has a single server receiving packets from the compute queue with memoryless service time. We consider the transmit queue in two forms: (i) No data buffer and (ii) One unit data buffer and last come first serve with discarding. We analyze various non-preemptive as well as preemptive cases. We perform stationary distribution analysis and obtain closed form expressions for average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI. Our numerical results illustrate analytical findings on how computation and transmission times could be traded off to optimize AoI and reveal a consequent tradeoff between average AoI and average peak AoI.",

To achieve secure D2D communication, the key agreement between different IoT devices without any prior knowledge is becoming desirable. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, they suffer from a number of limitations, such as low key generation rate and short pairing distance. In this paper, we present InaudibleKey, an inaudible acoustic signal based key generation protocol for mobile devices. Based on acoustic channel reciprocity, InaudibleKey exploits the acoustic channel frequency response of two legitimate devices as a common secret to generating keys. InaudibleKey employs several novel technologies to significantly improve its performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed system in different real environments. Compared to state-of-the-art works, InaudibleKey improves key generation rate by 3 times, extends pairing distance by 3.2 times, and reduces information reconciliation counts by 2.5 times. Security analysis demonstrates that InaudibleKey is resilient to a number of malicious attacks. We also implement InaudibleKey on modern smartphones and resource-limited IoT devices. Results show that it is energy-efficient and can run on both powerful and resource-limited IoT devices without incurring excessive resource consumption.",

We start from the recent standards developed by the IETF SUIT working group and contribute a system that allows for a timely discovery of new firmware versions by using cryptographically protected manifest files. Our design enables a cascading firmware roll-out from a gateway towards leaf nodes in a low-power multi-hop network. While a chunking mechanism prepares firmware images for typically low-sized maximum transmission units (MTUs), an early Denial-of-Service (DoS) detection prevents the distribution of tampered or malformed chunks.

        "abstract": "With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), establishing a secure channel between smart devices becomes crucial. Recent research proposes zero-interaction pairing (ZIP), which enables pairing without user assistance by utilizing devices' physical context (e.g., ambient audio) to obtain a shared secret key. The state-of-the-art ZIP schemes suffer from three limitations: (1) prolonged pairing time (i.e., minutes or hours), (2) vulnerability to brute-force offline attacks on a shared key, and (3) susceptibility to attacks caused by predictable context (e.g., replay attack) because they rely on limited entropy of physical context to protect a shared key. We address these limitations, proposing FastZIP, a novel ZIP scheme that significantly reduces pairing time while preventing offline and predictable context attacks. In particular, we adapt a recently introduced Fuzzy Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (fPAKE) protocol and utilize sensor fusion, maximizing their advantages. We instantiate FastZIP for intra-car device pairing to demonstrate its feasibility and show how the design of FastZIP can be adapted to other ZIP use cases. We implement FastZIP and evaluate it by driving four cars for a total of 800 km. We achieve up to three times shorter pairing time compared to the state-of-the-art ZIP schemes while assuring robust security with adversarial error rates below 0.5%.",

Then, the Master, Worker, and MiddleWare layers in the framework, and the development structure of a DCBV framework are designed. The task allocation and recovery strategy, message passing and communication mode, and fault tolerance processing are discussed. Finally, to calculate and verify parameters such as the average shortest path of the framework and shorten calculation time, an improved accurate shortest path algorithm, the N-SPFA algorithm, is proposed. Under different datasets, the node calculation and performance of the N-SPFA algorithm are explored. The algorithm is compared with four approximate shortest-path algorithms: Combined Link and Attribute (CLA), Lexicographic Breadth First Search (LBFS), Approximate algorithm of shortest path length based on center distance of area division (CDZ), and Hub Vertex of area and Core Expressway (HEA-CE). The results show that when the number of CPU threads is 4, the computation time of the DCBV framework is the shortest (514.63 ms). As the number of CPU cores increases, the overall computation time of the framework decreases gradually. For every 2 additional CPU cores, the number of tasks increases by 1. When the number of Worker nodes is 8 and the number of nodes is 1, the computation time of the framework is the shortest (210,979 ms), and the IO statistics data increase with the increase of Worker nodes. When the datasets are Undirected01 and Undirected02, the computation time of the N-SPFA algorithm is the shortest, which is 4520 ms and 7324 ms, respectively. However, the calculation time in the ca-condmat_undirected dataset is 175,292 ms, and the performance is slightly worse. Overall, however, the performance of the N-SPFA and SPFA algorithms is good. Therefore, the two algorithms are combined. For networks with less complexity, the computational scale coefficient of the SPFA algorithm can be set to 0.06, and for general networks, 0.2. When compared with other algorithms in different datasets, the pretreatment time, average query time, and overall query time of N-SPFA algorithm are the shortest, being 49.67 ms, 5.12 ms, and 94,720 ms, respectively. The accuracy (1.0087) and error rate (0.024) are also the best. In conclusion, voluntary computing can be applied to the processing of big data, which has a good reference significance for the distributed analysis of large-scale complex networks.",

The literature shows that attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions drive compliance behavior and has influenced the creation of a multitude of training programs focused on improving ones’ InfoSec behaviors. While automated controls and directly observable technical indicators are generally preferred by InfoSec practitioners, difficult-to-monitor user actions can still compromise the effectiveness of automatic controls. For example, despite prohibition, doubtful or skeptical employees often increase organizational risk by using the same password to authenticate corporate and external services. Analysis of network traffic or device configurations is unlikely to provide evidence of these vulnerabilities but responses to well-designed surveys might. Guided by the relatively new IPAM model, this study administered 96 survey items from the Behavioral InfoSec literature, across three separate points in time, to 217 respondents. Using systematic feature selection techniques, manageable subsets of 29, 20, and 15 items were identified and tested as predictors of non-compliance with security policy. The feature selection process validates IPAM's innovation in using nuanced self-efficacy and planning items across multiple time frames. Prediction models were trained using several ML algorithms. Practically useful levels of prediction accuracy were achieved with, for example, ensemble tree models identifying 69% of the riskiest individuals within the top 25% of the sample. The findings indicate the usefulness of psychometric items from the behavioral InfoSec in guiding training programs and other cybersecurity control activities and demonstrate that they are promising as additional inputs to AI models that monitor networks for security events.",

However, despite their low memory and energy demands, their intrinsically high computational intensity makes the execution of these workloads challenging on highly resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present BiSon-e, a novel RISC-V based architecture that accelerates linear algebra kernels based on narrow integer computations on edge processors by performing Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) operations on off-the-shelf scalar Functional Units (FUs). Our novel architecture is built upon the binary segmentation technique, which allows to significantly reduce the memory footprint and the arithmetic intensity of linear algebra kernels requiring narrow data sizes. We integrate BiSon-e into a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) based on RISC-V, synthesized and Place&Routed in 65nm and 22nm technologies, introducing a negligible 0.07% area overhead with respect to the baseline architecture. Our experimental evaluation shows that, when computing the Convolution and Fully-Connected layers of the AlexNet and VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with 8-, 4-, and 2-bit, our solution gains up to 5.6×, 13.9× and 24× in execution time compared to the scalar implementation of a single RISC-V core, and improves the energy efficiency of string matching tasks by 5× when compared to a RISC-V-based Vector Processing Unit (VPU).",

Among the popular Android malware on the market today, click fraud malware, adware, banking Trojans, spyware, etc. are usually disguised and hidden in the heap of good Android applications. These advanced malwares lurk in the third-party application market trusted by users, and potentially endanger the security of the user's smart device causing privacy or economic loss. Therefore, this paper leverages and combines traditional machine learning and anomaly detection methods to detect specific classes of Android malware in three highly imbalanced Android datasets (entertainment + social app vs. click fraud malware + adware; financial services app vs. banking trojan; communication app vs. spyware). The experiment results show that our proposed combined methods have great performance on the three sub-datasets, achieving the average f1-score over 0.98 on three imbalanced datasets, which performs better than the traditional machine learning algorithm used alone. In addition, we use the combined methods to analyze the correlation between the top features of the dataset, and provide interpretable insights for other researchers focusing on Android malware classification in the coming future.",

We apply the μSCOPE methodology to the Linux kernel by (1) instrumenting the entire kernel to gain comprehensive, fine-grained memory access and call activity; (2) mapping these accesses to semantic information; and (3) conducting separability analysis on the kernel using both quantitative privilege and overhead metrics.

Power consumption is one kind of these signals and can be regarded as a multimedia form. In recent years, many artificial intelligence technologies have been combined with classical side-channel analysis methods to improve the efficiency and accuracy. A simple genetic algorithm was employed in Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) when apply to cryptographic algorithms implemented in parallel. However, premature convergence caused failure in recovering the whole key, especially when plenty of large S-boxes were employed in the target primitive, such as in the case of AES. In this article, we investigate the reason of premature convergence and propose a Multiple Sieve Method (MS-CPA), which overcomes this problem and reduces the number of traces required in correlation power analysis. Our method can be adjusted to combine with key enumeration algorithms and further improves the efficiency. Simulation experimental results depict that our method reduces the required number of traces by \\(\\) and \\(\\), compared to classic CPA and the Simple-Genetic-Algorithm-based CPA (SGA-CPA), respectively, when the success rate is fixed to \\(\\). Real experiments performed on SAKURA-G confirm that the number of traces required for recovering the correct key in our method is almost equal to the minimum number that makes the correlation coefficients of correct keys stand out from the wrong ones and is much less than the numbers of traces required in CPA and SGA-CPA. When combining with key enumeration algorithms, our method has better performance. For the traces number being 200 (noise standard deviation \\(\\)), the attacks success rate of our method is \\(\\), which is much higher than the classic CPA with key enumeration (\\(\\) success rate). Moreover, we adjust our method to work on that DPA contest v1 dataset and achieve a better result (40.04 traces) than the winning proposal (42.42 traces).",

In order to obtain the better approximate solution, a frequency-first heuristic method is proposed, which can optimize the number of XOR gates required by linear components while ensuring the stability of the algorithm. Firstly, we combine the pre-emptive gate strategy with frequency-first (FQCY) in the selection stage to reduce the increase of time complexity caused by exhaustive search, so that the high-density matrix can obtain the optimal result within a reasonable time. Secondly, minimization of vector and appropriate randomization are added to deal with the tie, so as to give full play to the advantages of cancellation-allowed circuit and increase the possibility of obtaining the optimal solution. Finally, compared with Paar, BP, RNBP, RSDF algorithms on random matrices of various sizes and densities, it is proved that the probability of obtaining the optimal solution of the proposed algorithm in circuit depth is more than 30% higher than RNBP and RSDF. In terms of the number of XOR gates, especially for larger matrix, the probability of obtaining the optimal solution increases by more than 10%. The stability of the optimal circuit generated by this algorithm is about 90%.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose SecDeep, a low-power DL inference framework demonstrating that both security and performance of deep learning inference on edge devices are well within our reach. Leveraging TEEs with limited resources, SecDeep guarantees full confidentiality for input and intermediate data, as well as the integrity of the deep learning model and framework. By enabling and securing neural accelerators, SecDeep is the first of its kind to provide trusted and performant DL model inferencing on IoT and mobile devices. We implement and validate SecDeep by interfacing the ARM NN DL framework with ARM TrustZone. Our evaluation shows that we can securely run inference tasks with 16× to 172× faster performance than no acceleration approaches by leveraging edge-available accelerators.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most commonly ordered imaging tests, the computed tomography (CT) scan comes with inevitable radiation exposure that increases cancer risk to patients. However, CT image quality is directly related to radiation dose, and thus it is desirable to obtain high-quality CT images with as little dose as possible. CT image denoising tries to obtain high-dose-like high-quality CT images (domain Y) from low dose low-quality CT images (domain X), which can be treated as an image-to-image translation task where the goal is to learn the transform between a source domain X (noisy images) and a target domain Y (clean images). Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial denoising network (CCADN) has achieved state-of-the-art results by enforcing cycle-consistent loss without the need of paired training data, since the paired data is hard to collect due to patients’ interests and cardiac motion. However, out of concerns on patients’ privacy and data security, protocols typically require clinics to perform medical image processing tasks including CT image denoising locally (i.e., edge denoising). Therefore, the network models need to achieve high performance under various computation resource constraints including memory and performance. Our detailed analysis of CCADN raises a number of interesting questions that point to potential ways to further improve its performance using the same or even fewer computation resources. For example, if the noise is large leading to a significant difference between domain X and domain Y, can we bridge X and Y with a intermediate domain Z such that both the denoising process between X and Z and that between Z and Y are easier to learn? As such intermediate domains lead to multiple cycles, how do we best enforce cycle- consistency? Driven by these questions, we propose a multi-cycle-consistent adversarial network (MCCAN) that builds intermediate domains and enforces both local and global cycle-consistency for edge denoising of CT images. The global cycle-consistency couples all generators together to model the whole denoising process, whereas the local cycle-consistency imposes effective supervision on the process between adjacent domains. Experiments show that both local and global cycle-consistency are important for the success of MCCAN, which outperforms CCADN in terms of denoising quality with slightly less computation resource consumption.",

However, in this paper we show that the forward-private schemes have no advantage (in preventing the related attacks) compared to traditional approaches, and previous attacks are still applicable on FP schemes. In FP approaches, access pattern leakage is still possible and can be employed to uncover the search pattern which can be used by passive and adaptive attacks. To address this issue, we construct a new parallelizable DSSE approach to obfuscate the access and search pattern. Our cost-efficient scheme supports both updates and searches.

For new network traffic, essential features are extracted based on the first few packets, which guarantee real-time network intrusion detection. The proposed model adopts a two-layer hierarchical structure. The first layer namely the anomaly detection sub-model is based on DAGMM, which can detect abnormal traffic in real-time. The second layer namely the attack recognition sub-model identifies the attack categories of abnormal traffic detected by the anomaly detection sub-model, and getting rid of the difficulty of reconstructing abnormal traffic in DAE.

We achieve this by adding a sufficiently large (controlled) noise to the task schedules in order to break their deterministic execution patterns. An \"epsilon-Scheduler\" then implements schedule indistinguishability in real-time Linux. We evaluate our system using two real applications: (a) an autonomous rover running on a real hardware platform (Raspberry Pi) and (b) a video streaming application that sends data across large geographic distances.

We show that SCP achieves this comparison in a constant number of rounds, without using encryption and not requiring the participants’ continuous involvement. SCP uses semi-trusted third parties - which we refer to as privacy accountants - for the comparison, who do not learn any information about the values. That is, the probability of information leak is negligible in the problem size. In SCP, we also leverage the Ethereum network for pseudo-anonymous communication, unlike computationally expensive secure channels such as Tor. We present a Secure Truthful cOmbinatorial aUction Protocol (STOUP) for single-minded bidders to demonstrate SCP’s significance. We show that STOUP, unlike previous works, preserves the privacies relevant to an auction even from the auctioneer. We demonstrate the practicality of STOUP through simulations.",

        "abstract": "(Background) Software vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to the security of computer systems. Hence, there is a constant race for defenders to find and patch them before attackers are able to exploit them. Measuring different aspects of this process is important in order to better understand it and improve the odds for defenders. (Aims) The human factor of the vulnerability discovery and patching process has received limited attention. Better knowledge of the characteristics of the people and organizations who discover and report security vulnerabilities can considerably enhance our understanding of the process, provide insights regarding the expended effort in vulnerability hunting, contribute to better security metrics, and help guide practical decisions regarding the strategy of projects to attract vulnerability researchers. (Method) In this paper, we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale empirical study on the people and organizations who report vulnerabilities in popular FLOSS projects. Collecting data from a multitude of publicly available sources (NVD, bug-tracking platforms, vendor advisories, source code repositories), we create a dataset of reporter information for 2193 unique reporting entities of 4756 CVEs affecting the Mozilla suite, Apache httpd, the PHP interpreter, and the Linux kernel. We use the dataset to investigate several aspects of the vulnerability discovery process, specifically regarding the distribution of contributions, their temporal characteristics, and the motivations of reporters. (Results) Among our results: around 80% of reports come from 20% of reporters; first time reporters are significant contributors to the yearly total in all 4 projects; productive reporters are specialized w.r.t. the project and vulnerability types; around half of all reports come from reporters acknowledging an affiliation. (Conclusions) Projects depend both on a core of dedicated and productive reporters, and on small contributions from a large number of community reporters. The generalized Pareto principle (the (1 - p)/p law) can be used as a metric for the concentration of contributions in the vulnerability-reporting ecosystem of a project.",

        "abstract": "A challenging problem in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) of smart grids is the identification of smart meters under the control of a stealthy adversary, that inject very low margins of stealthy data falsification. The problem is challenging due to wide legitimate variation in both individual and aggregate trends in real world power consumption data, making such stealthy attacks unrecognizable by existing approaches. In this paper, via proposed modified diversity index scoring metric, we propose a novel information-theory inspired data driven device anomaly classification framework to identify compromised meters launching low margins of stealthy data falsification attacks. Specifically, we draw a parallelism between the effects of data falsification attacks and ecological balance disruptions and identify required mathematical modifications in existing Renyi Entropy and Hill's Diversity Entropy measures. These modifications such as expected self-similarity with weighted abundance shifts across various temporal scales, and diversity order are appropriately embedded in our resulting framework. The resulting diversity index score is used to classify smart meters launching additive, deductive, and alternating switching attack types with high sensitivity (as low as 100W) compared to the existing works that perform poorly at margins of false data below 400W. Our proposed theory is validated with two different real smart meter datasets from USA and Ireland. Experimental results demonstrate successful detection sensitivity from very low to high margins of false data, thus reducing undetectable strategy space of attacks in AMI for an adversary having complete knowledge of our method.",

A better understanding of these workflows could help identify new research directions that are impactful in practice. In order to better understand malware analysis processes, we present the results of a user study with 21 professional malware analysts with diverse backgrounds who work at 18 different companies. The study focuses on answering three research questions: (1) What are the different objectives of malware analysts in practice?, (2) What comprises a typical professional malware analyst workflow, and (3) When analysts decide to conduct dynamic analysis, what factors do they consider when setting up a dynamic analysis system? Based on participant responses, we propose a taxonomy of malware analysts and identify five common analysis workflows. We also identify challenges that analysts face during the different stages of their workflow. From the results of the study, we propose two potential directions for future research, informed by challenges described by the participants. Finally, we recommend guidelines for developers of malware analysis tools to consider in order to improve the usability of such tools.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of multimedia technology, digital images are increasingly used. These applications bring great convenience to users but increase the risk of information leakage. According to the granularity of operation, the existing image encryption methods can be divided into pixel-level and bit-level. The pixel-level method has high encryption efficiency, but does not break the linear relationship totally; the bit-level method has high security, but it needs to convert pixel value to 8 bits, which causes the low encryption efficiency. The current research on the hybrid encryption method performs pixel-level and bit-level operations in series. Although the methods can improve security to some extent, they still unsolve the inefficiencies problem. In this regard, we proposed a pixel-level bit-level hybrid diffusion image encryption method based on the traditional permutation-diffusion structure. The randomness is significantly improved by calculating the diffusion order through a double chaotic matrix. Meanwhile, we embedded bit flip into the diffusion process to further enhance the security of encryption. The experimental results show that our method achieves better results in five security metrics (pixel histogram analysis, key sensitivity, plaintext sensitivity, pixel correlation, and information entropy) compared with existing image encryption methods. Also, the time required for encryption is reduced by 6% compared to mainstream efficient encryption algorithms.",

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods are the popular choices for training VFL models because of the low per-iteration computation. However, existing SGD-based VFL algorithms are communication-expensive due to a large number of communication rounds. Meanwhile, most existing VFL algorithms use synchronous computation which seriously hamper the computation resource utilization in real-world applications. To address the challenges of communication and computation resource utilization, we propose an asynchronous stochastic quasi-Newton (AsySQN) framework for VFL, under which three algorithms, i.e. AsySQN-SGD, -SVRG and -SAGA, are proposed. The proposed AsySQN-type algorithms making descent steps scaled by approximate (without calculating the inverse Hessian matrix explicitly) Hessian information convergence much faster than SGD-based methods in practice and thus can dramatically reduce the number of communication rounds. Moreover, the adopted asynchronous computation can make better use of the computation resource. We theoretically prove the convergence rates of our proposed algorithms for strongly convex problems. Extensive numerical experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the lower communication costs and better computation resource utilization of our algorithms compared with state-of-the-art VFL algorithms.",

We deploy the EdgeLSTM into four IoT applications, including data prediction, anomaly detection, network maintenance and mobility management by extensive experiments.

However, the root cause of these challenges are often misunderstood, or neglected. Therefore, this paper deals with the question of identifying the contextual factors that create the challenges which exist in K-12 computing education. To do this, the perspectives of 32 English college employees were considered, with the challenges and contextual factors identified being mapped to Biggs 3P Model of classroom learning. Through this process, in addition to a short comparison between English and Finnish education systems and policy, the 3P Model was re-framed to include the fourth P of Policy consisting of ‘government priorities’, and ‘regulatory bodies’. Findings indicate the extent to which contextual factors influence the challenges and effectiveness of computing education, and how many of these factors are interlinked, despite ranging from macro-environment trends and policy to an individual student’s knowledge of programming. Together, these findings raise important philosophical questions of what computing education is, and what the goals of computing education should be. The answers to these questions have significant implications for practice, which practitioners and policy makers must consider for the design of any computing program of study, while the amended 3P Model can be used to identify the contextual factors which may influence the effectiveness of such programs. Furthermore, this paper contributes to the limited body of research concerning English college education, and more specifically perspectives regarding computing education in this context.",

We then show that the balanced assignment of non-overlapping batches achieves a lower average job compute time than the overlapping schemes proposed in the literature. Next, we derive the optimum redundancy level as a function of the task service time distribution. We show that the redundancy level that minimizes the average job compute time may not coincide with the redundancy level that maximizes job compute time predictability. Therefore, there is a trade-off in optimizing the two metrics. By running experiments on Google cluster traces, we observe that redundancy can reduce the job compute time by one order of magnitude. The optimum level of redundancy depends on the distribution of task service time.",

The key idea is to run multiple diversified program variants in lockstep while providing them with the same input and monitoring their run-time behavior for divergences. Thus, adversaries have to compromise all program variants simultaneously to mount an attack successfully. Recent work proposed distributed, heterogeneous MVX systems that leverage different ABIs and ISAs to increase the diversity between program variants further. However, existing distributed MVX system designs suffer from high performance overhead due to time-consuming network transactions required for the MVX operations. This paper presents dMVX, a novel hybrid distributed MVX design, which incorporates new techniques that significantly reduce the overhead of MVX systems in a distributed setting. Our key insight is that we can intelligently reduce the MVX operations that use expensive network transfers. First, we can limit the monitoring of system calls that are not security-critical. Second, we observe that, in many circumstances, we can also safely avoid replication operations needed for I/O related system calls. Our evaluation shows that dMVX reduces the performance degradation from over 50% to 3.1% for realistic server benchmarks.",

An improper treatment, however, can cause serious harm. Here, the decision logic leading to the treatment relies on data obtained from sensors --- an inherently imperfect medium. Coping with these inaccuracies requires the logic to be robust in the sense that slight perturbations in the measurements do not significantly alter the decision. Determining the extent to which an algorithm is robust automatically does not scale well for complex and opaque components. This is particularly problematic when machine learning is involved. Yet, the analysis is feasible for simpler safety-related components such as a runtime monitor, which observes the system and intervenes in a treatment when necessary. Its significantly lower complexity generally allows for providing static guarantees on the runtime behavior of the monitor. Complementing these guarantees with a robustness analysis constitutes a major step toward certifiable medical cyber-physical systems controlled by opaque, machine-learned components. Hence, this paper reports on ongoing research in the direction of a robustness analysis for the runtime monitoring framework RTLola.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a promising role in e-healthcare applications in the recent decades; nevertheless, security is one of the crucial challenges in the current field of study. Many healthcare devices (for instance, a sensor-augmented insulin pump and heart-rate sensor) collect a user’s real-time data (such as glucose level and heart rate) and send them to the cloud for proper analysis and diagnosis of the user. However, the real-time user’s data are vulnerable to various authentication attacks while sending through an insecure channel. Besides that, the attacks may further open scope for many other subsequent attacks. Existing security mechanisms concentrate on two-party mutual authentication. However, an IoT-enabled healthcare application involves multiple parties such as a patient, e-healthcare test-equipment, doctors, and cloud servers that requires multi-party authentication for secure communication. Moreover, the design and implementation of a lightweight security mechanism that fits into the resource constraint IoT-enabled healthcare devices are challenging. Therefore, this article proposes a lightweight, multi-party authentication and key-establishment protocol in IoT-based e-healthcare service access network to counter the attacks in resource constraint devices. The proposed multi-party protocol has used a lattice-based cryptographic construct such as Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to acquire security, privacy, and efficiency. The study provided all-round analysis of the scheme, such as security, power consumption, and practical usage, in the following ways. The proposed scheme is tested by a formal security tool, Scyther, to testify the security properties of the protocol. In addition, security analysis for various attacks and comparison with other existing works are provided to show the robust security characteristics. Further, an experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme using IBE cryptographic construct is provided to validate the practical usage. The power consumption of the scheme is also computed and compared with existing works to evaluate its efficiency.",

However, current analysis methods based on operation code or function call graphs generally do not work well with diversity in central processing unit (CPU) architecture and are often resource-intensive.

The main contribution of the paper is extracting PSI graph from executable files and exploiting a representative set of features from PSI-graph, which has a negligible number of attributes but achieves positive performance for IoT botnet malware detection (94.84% accuracy)",

        "abstract": "Wireless body area network (WBAN) suffers secure challenges, especially the eavesdropping attack, due to constraint resources. In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and mobile edge computing (MEC) technology are adopted to formulate a DRL-MEC-based jamming-aided anti-eavesdropping (DMEC-JAE) scheme to resist the eavesdropping attack without considering the channel state information. In this scheme, a MEC sensor is chosen to send artificial jamming signals to improve the secrecy rate of the system. Power control technique is utilized to optimize the transmission power of both the source sensor and the MEC sensor to save energy. The remaining energy of the MEC sensor is concerned to ensure routine data transmission and jamming signal transmission. Additionally, the DMEC-JAE scheme integrates with transfer learning for a higher learning rate. The performance bounds of the scheme concerning the secrecy rate, energy consumption, and the utility are evaluated. Simulation results show that the DMEC-JAE scheme can approach the performance bounds with high learning speed, which outperforms the benchmark schemes.",

        "abstract": "To learn a well-performed image annotation model, a large number of labeled samples are usually required. Although the unlabeled samples are readily available and abundant, it is a difficult task for humans to annotate large numbers of images manually. In this article, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach based on adaptive weighted fusion for automatic image annotation that can simultaneously utilize the labeled data and unlabeled data to improve the annotation performance. At first, two different classifiers, constructed based on support vector machine and covolutional neural network, respectively, are trained by different features extracted from the labeled data. Therefore, these two classifiers are independently represented as different feature views. Then, the corresponding features of unlabeled images are extracted and input into these two classifiers, and the semantic annotation of images can be obtained respectively. At the same time, the confidence of corresponding image annotation can be measured by an adaptive weighted fusion strategy. After that, the images and its semantic annotations with high confidence are submitted to the classifiers for retraining until a certain stop condition is reached. As a result, we can obtain a strong classifier that can make full use of unlabeled data. Finally, we conduct experiments on four datasets, namely, Corel 5K, IAPR TC12, ESP Game, and NUS-WIDE. In addition, we measure the performance of our approach with standard criteria, including precision, recall, F-measure, N+, and mAP. The experimental results show that our approach has superior performance and outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches.",

The goal of this paper is to develop a technique to deceive and dissuade such adversaries. We propose HoneyRoles, which uses honey connections to build metaphorical haystacks around the network traffic of client hosts belonging to high-value organizational roles. The honey connections also act as network canaries to signal network compromise, thereby dissuading the adversary from acting on information observed in network flows. We design a prototype implementation of HoneyRoles an OpenFlow SDN controller and evaluate its security using the PRISM probabilistic model checker. Our performance evaluation shows that HoneyRoles has a small effect on network request completion time, and security analysis demonstrates that once an alert is raised, HoneyRoles can quickly identify the compromised switch with high probability. In doing so, we show that role-based network deception is a promising approach for defending against adversaries in compromised network devices.",

        "abstract": "DDoS attacks are simple, effective, and still pose a significant threat even after more than two decades. Given the recent success in machine learning, it is interesting to investigate how we can leverage deep learning to filter out application layer attack requests. There are challenges in adopting deep learning solutions due to the ever-changing profiles, the lack of labeled data, and constraints in the online setting. Offline unsupervised learning methods can sidestep these hurdles by learning an anomaly detector N from the normal-day traffic N. However, anomaly detection does not exploit information acquired during attacks, and their performance typically is not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose two approaches that utilize both the historic N and the mixture M traffic obtained during attacks, consisting of unlabeled requests. First, our proposed approach, inspired by statistical methods, extends an unsupervised anomaly detector N to solve the problem using estimated conditional probability distributions. We adopt transfer learning to apply N on N and M separately and efficiently, combining the results to obtain an online learner. Second, we formulate a specific loss function more suited for deep learning and use iterative training to solve it in the online setting. On publicly available datasets, such as the CICIDS2017, our online learners achieve an average of 90.6% accuracy rates compared to the baseline detection method, which achieves around 60.0% accuracy. In the offline setting, our approaches on unlabeled data achieve competitive accuracy compared to classifiers trained on labeled data.",

To protect against RowHammer, vendors commit to security-through-obscurity: modern DRAM chips rely on undocumented, proprietary, on-die mitigations, commonly known as Target Row Refresh (TRR). At a high level, TRR detects and refreshes potential RowHammer-victim rows, but its exact implementations are not openly disclosed. Security guarantees of TRR mechanisms cannot be easily studied due to their proprietary nature.  To assess the security guarantees of recent DRAM chips, we present Uncovering TRR (U-TRR), an experimental methodology to analyze in-DRAM TRR implementations. U-TRR is based on the new observation that data retention failures in DRAM enable a side channel that leaks information on how TRR refreshes potential victim rows. U-TRR allows us to (i) understand how logical DRAM rows are laid out physically in silicon; (ii) study undocumented on-die TRR mechanisms; and (iii) combine (i) and (ii) to evaluate the RowHammer security guarantees of modern DRAM chips. We show how U-TRR allows us to craft RowHammer access patterns that successfully circumvent the TRR mechanisms employed in 45 DRAM modules of the three major DRAM vendors. We find that the DRAM modules we analyze are vulnerable to RowHammer, having bit flips in up to 99.9% of all DRAM rows.",

        "abstract": "Pairings are a powerful algebraic setting for realizing cryptographic functionalities. One challenge for cryptographers who design pairing systems is that the complexity of many systems in terms of the number of group elements and equations to verify has been steadily increasing over the past decade and is approaching the point of being unwieldy. To combat this challenge, multiple independent works have utilized computers to help with the system design. One common design task that researchers seek to automate is summarized as follows: given a description of a set of trusted elements T (e.g., a public key) and a set of untrusted elements U (e.g., a signature), automatically generate an algorithm that verifies U with respect to T using the pairing and group operations. To date, none of the prior automation works for this task have support for solutions with rational polynomials in the exponents despite many pairing constructions employing them (e.g., Boneh-Boyen signatures, Gentry's IBE, Dodis-Yampolskiy VRF). We demonstrate how to support this essential class of pairing systems for automated exploration. Specifically, we present a solution for automatically generating a verification algorithm with novel support for rational polynomials. The class of verification algorithms we consider in this work is called PPE Circuits (introduced in [HVW20]). Intuitively, a PPE Circuit is a circuit supporting pairing and group operations, which can test whether a set of elements U verifies with respect to a set of elements T. We provide a formalization of the problem, an algorithm for searching for a PPE Circuit supporting rational polynomials, a software implementation, and a detailed performance evaluation. Our implementation was tested on over three dozen schemes, including over ten test cases that our tool can handle, but prior tools could not. For all test cases where a PPE Circuit exists, the tool produced a solution in three minutes or less.",

In this paper, we design the weighted cross-modal attention mechanism, which not only captures the temporal correlation information and the spatial dependence information of each modality, but also dynamically adjusts the weight of each modality across different time steps. And the unimodal subtasks are led for assisting the representation learning of specific modality to jointly train the multimodal tasks and unimodal subtasks to explore the complementary relationships of each modality. Our model gets a new state-of-the-art record on the CMU-MOSI dataset and brings noticeable performance improvements on all the metrics. For the CMU-MOSEI dataset, the F1 score of the binary classification, the 7-class task, and the regression task of our model are still the highest among all models and the proposed model is only lower than the multimodal split attention fusion (MSAF) model with aligned data on the accuracy of the binary classification, showing the great performance of the suggested method.",

        "abstract": "Due to the strong protection of anonymity, Darknet has been exploited by criminals to distribute harmful content and banned items, such as drugs, weapons, and malware, which are regarded as public hazard entities. The task of public hazard entity recognition can help to detect and analyze malicious activities in the Darknet. This paper focuses on the research of Chinese public hazard entity recognition in the field of illegal drugs. To evade detection and surveillance, Chinese public hazard entities in the Darknet usually utilize disguised forms, like homophones and multi-entities in a sentence, which makes it harder to identify them using traditional entity recognition methods. In this paper, we present an effective deep learning-based multi-information fusion model to identify Chinese public hazard entities in the Darknet. Specifically, we introduce the grammatical information by adding Pinyin and lexical features, and strengthen the semantic features by adding the word vectors from one advanced pre-trained language representation model. Then we combine these three parts with a classical sequence annotation architecture used in general named entity recognition to form our ultimate model. At last we construct a real dataset from drugs-related groups in the Darknet and conduct several experiments to evaluate our model. The experimental result verifies that our proposed model gains a good performance on the recognition of Darknet public hazard entities.",

        "abstract": "IoT platforms enable users to connect various smart devices and online services via reactive apps running on the cloud. These apps, often developed by third-parties, perform simple computations on data triggered by external information sources and actuate the results of computations on external information sinks. Recent research shows that unintended or malicious interactions between the different (even benign) apps of a user can cause severe security and safety risks. These works leverage program analysis techniques to build tools for unveiling unexpected interference across apps for specific use cases. Despite these initial efforts, we are still lacking a semantic framework for understanding interactions between IoT apps. The question of what security policy cross-app interference embodies remains largely unexplored.This article proposes a semantic framework capturing the essence of cross-app interactions in IoT platforms. The framework generalizes and connects syntactic enforcement mechanisms to bisimulation-based notions of security, thus providing a baseline for formulating soundness criteria of these enforcement mechanisms. Specifically, we present a calculus that models the behavioral semantics of a system of apps executing concurrently, and use it to define desirable semantic policies targeting the security and safety of IoT apps. To demonstrate the usefulness of our framework, we define and implement static analyses for enforcing cross-app security and safety, and prove them sound with respect to our semantic conditions. We also leverage real-world apps to validate the practical benefits of our tools based on the proposed enforcement mechanisms.",

The smart city includes the Internet of things (IoT) devices in various domains, such as smart metering, smart grids, health care, logistics, and transport. However, interoperability among devices in different domains is difficult due to the lack of common standards. In particular, interoperability in IoT environments is divided into several types (e.g., semantic, syntactic, network, and middleware), and each has different requirements. Therefore, interoperability issues should be identified on different levels, and the requirements should be proposed differently for each type. In this paper, we applied the interoperability types in the IoT environment to the smart city. In addition, we derived the requirements for five types of interoperability in a smart city based on various interoperability studies in the IoT environment. Consequently, we presented the five interoperability types (i.e., syntactic, semantic, network, middleware, and security) by adding common security for each type and presented the requirements that satisfy various interoperability issues in the smart city.",

In this article, we propose a Chinese emotional dialogue response generation algorithm based on reinforcement learning that can generate responses not only according to content but also according to emotion. In the proposed method, a multi-emotion classification model is first used to add emotion labels to the corpus of post-response pairs. Then, with the help of reinforcement learning, the reward function is constructed based on two aspects, namely, emotion and content. Among the generated candidates, the system selects the one with long-term success as the best reply. At the same time, to avoid safe responses and diversify dialogue, a diversity beam search algorithm is applied in the decoding process. The comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves satisfactory results according to both automatic and human evaluations.",

In this paper, we present APUF-BN, a novel computer-aided design (CAD) framework to efficiently generate a combinational circuit representation of an Arbiter PUF (APUF) instance, which accurately mimics its input-output behavior. This representation is derived from an optimized fully-connected Binarized Neural Network (BNN) model of the APUF. Our fully-automated CAD framework takes challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of an APUF instance as input, and generates Verilog description corresponding to the optimized combinational circuit representation as output. The optimized Boolean logic representation achieves more than 24% reduction in area overhead compared to the unoptimized BNN representation, while achieving close to 98% modeling accuracy. We also validate the derived combinational circuit representation on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA platform.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things has a profound effect on everyday life and critical vertical services including healthcare, factories of the future and intelligent transport systems. The highly distributed nature of such networks and the heterogeneity of the devices, which constitute them, necessitates that their users should be able to trust them at all times. A method to determine the device's service trustworthiness is Trust Management (TM), which assigns scores to devices according to their trustworthiness level, based on evaluations from other entities that interacted with it. Often Internet of Things devices that just joined the network, have not interacted with any other entity of this network before, hence there is no way to determine its trustworthiness. Such an event is referred to as the cold start trust score or initial trust score problem. The majority of the trust management approaches address this problem by setting an arbitrary initial trust score, while others will ignore it. Assigning arbitrary trust scores for devices connected to the network for the first time has the potential to disrupt the operation of the entire system, when a high trust score is assigned to a non-trusted malicious device, or lead to unfair policies, when trusted devices are assumed as potential intruders, which also deteriorates the performance of the system. This paper proposes a mechanism, which combines the blockchain based BARRETT remote attestation protocol with a set of device's properties and communication and operational context parameters, in order to determine accurately and assign the initial trust score to each device. Through a set of extensive simulations over different experimental setups, the proposed scheme is achieving to safely distribute initial trust scores to one thousand devices over less than 6ms, while minimising the risk of computational denial of service attacks due to the inherent characteristics of the BARRETT remote attestation protocol.",

To overcome this problem, we design a potential seed selection scheme, called MOAFL. The key idea is to measure seed potential utilizing multiple objectives and prioritize promising seeds that are more likely to generate interesting seeds via mutation. More specifically, MOAFL leverages lightweight swarm intelligence techniques like Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) to handle multi-criteria seed selection, which allows MOAFL to choose promising seeds effectively. We implement this scheme based on AFL and our evaluations on LAVA-M dataset and 7 popular real-world programs demonstrate that MOAFL significantly increases the code coverage over AFL.",

Many researchers have been devoted to protecting the face template. Nevertheless, to achieve high security for the face template, partial matching accuracy is usually sacrificed. The main challenge of this problem is the low inter-user variations and high intra-user variations of facial images. In this work, we propose a method integrating residual learning and error-correcting codes for face template protection. In particular, the proposed method consists of two major components: (a) a deep residual network component mapping facial images to polar codewords assigned to users, and (b) a polar decoder reducing noise brought by high intra-user variations in the predicted codewords. The proposed method is evaluated on extended Yale B, CMU-PIE, and FEI databases. It provides high security of face template and achieves a high (100%) genuine accept rate at a low false accept rate (0%) simultaneously, which outperforms most state-of-the-arts.",

However, recently reported hardware-oriented attack vectors, e.g., fault injection attacks, have extended the threats on deployed deep neural network (DNN) systems beyond the software attack boundary by input data perturbation. Existing fault mitigation schemes including data masking, zeroing-on-error and circuit level time-borrowing techniques exploit the noise-tolerance of neural network models to resist random and sparse errors. Such noise tolerant-based schemes are not sufficiently effective to suppress intensive transient errors if a DNN accelerator is blasted with malicious and deliberate faults. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive investigations on reported resilient designs and propose a more robust countermeasure to fault injection attacks. The proposed design utilizes shadow flip flops for error detection and lightweight circuit for timely error correction. Our forward error compensation scheme rectifies the incorrect partial sum of the multiply-accumulation operation by estimating the difference between the correct and error-inflicted computation. The difference is added back to the final accumulated result at a later cycle without stalling the execution pipeline. We implemented our proposed design and the existing fault-mitigation schemes on the same Intel FPGA-based DNN accelerator to demonstrate its substantially enhanced resiliency against deliberate fault attacks on two popular DNN models, ResNet50 and VGG16, trained with ImageNet.",

Our study uncovers seven classes of microarchitectural optimization with novel security implications, proposes a conceptual framework through which to study them and demonstrates several proofs-of-concept to show their efficacy.

Since social media images are usually accompanied by rich metadata (e.g., textual descriptions, tags, groups, and submitted users), simply modeling the image is not effective to learn the comprehensive information from social media images. In this work, we treat the image and its textual description as multimodal content, and transform other metainformation into the links between contents (such as two images marked by the same tag or submitted by the same user).

The Warmonger attack exploits the fact that a serverless computing platform shares the same set of egress IPs among all serverless functions, which belong to different users, to access an external content server. As a result, a malicious user on this platform can purposefully misbehave and cause these egress IPs to be blocked by the content server, resulting in a platform-wide denial of service. To validate the Warmonger attack, we ran months-long experiments, collected and analyzed the egress IP usage pattern of four major serverless service providers (SSPs). We also conducted an in-depth evaluation of an attacker's possible moves to inflict an external server and cause IP-blockage. We demonstrate that some SSPs use surprisingly small numbers of egress IPs (as little as only four) and share them among their users, and that the serverless platform provides sufficient leverage for a malicious user to conduct well-known misbehaviors and cause IP-blockage. Our study unveiled a potential security threat on the emerging serverless computing platform, and shed light on potential mitigation approaches.",

        "abstract": "The digitized environments are particularly vulnerable to various attacks. In such a situation of a security attack, detecting and responding to attacks require effective actions. One of the most significant ways to improve resilience to security attacks is to obtain accurate and timely situational aspect of the security awareness. The efficient production and utilization of situation information is achieved by sharing information with other actors in the information sharing network quickly and reliably without compromising the confidential information of one's own organization. At the same time, it should also be possible to avoid a flood of irrelevant information in the sharing network, which wastes resources and slows down the implementation of security measures. In our study, we have investigated how security-related information can be shared online as efficiently as possible by building a security information sharing topology based on the two most widely used network optimization algorithms. In the article, we present a model of an information sharing network, in which three different parameters have been used to optimize the network topology: the activity level of organization, the similarity of information systems between different actors and the requirement for the level of information privacy generally in the organization.",

        "abstract": "Traceability has become an essential element of supply chain management, especially in safety-sensitive sectors such as food, pharmaceuticals, etc. Upstream (manufacturers, producers, etc.) and downstream (distributors, wholesalers, etc.) supply chain actors need to store and process traceability information in order to provide proof of regulatory compliance to national authorities as well as the most demanding customers. Studies have shown that developing countries, especially on the African continent, are particularly prone to the commercialization of counterfeit products and the use of diverted consumables, thus reducing the confidence in the various products and services offered by commercial enterprises, not only towards consumers but also towards companies and other actors of the concerned sectors. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to examine the characteristics and functionalities of blockchain technology and to identify blockchain-based solutions to address consumer product traceability issues, as well as to highlight the benefits of implementing blockchain-based traceability systems by proposing a blockchain architecture to ensure traceability and transparency.",

        "abstract": "On the basis of determining the basic objectives of enterprise internal accounting control, we should divide and design the specific objectives of enterprise internal accounting control according to the level of corporate governance structure and the content level of enterprise internal accounting control objectives, so as to implement the requirements of enterprise internal accounting control system concretely. As the third information technology revolution after personal computer and Internet technology, cloud computing's brand-new business model and concept have a profound impact on the production and operation activities of enterprises. To realize the internal accounting control of enterprises, it is necessary to construct the internal accounting control objectives correctly and reasonably, and carry out hierarchical design according to the relationship between powers and responsibilities in the corporate governance structure and the contents of the internal accounting control objectives. This paper analyzes the concept of cloud computing, its influence on the internal control of enterprises, and how to realize the internal control in the cloud computing environment, and puts forward the methods and strategies for the objective construction and hierarchical design of the internal accounting control of enterprises.",
